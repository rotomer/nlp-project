Holders of the HiMEDS Units will be entitled to receive quarterly contract adjustment payments of a rate of 2.525% per year of the stated amount of $50 per HiMEDS Unit, subject to Avery Dennison's right to defer such payments.
The Notes are being issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of November 20, 2007, as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of November 20, 2007 (as supplemented, the "Indenture"), between Avery Dennison and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee.

Under the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, the Notes are being pledged as collateral to secure the holders' obligation to purchase the shares of common stock under the purchase contracts. The Notes will be remarketed prior to the purchase contract settlement date pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and a Remarketing Agreement to be executed in the future.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
     Avery Dennison Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to issue and sell to the several Underwriters listed in Schedule 1 hereto (the "Underwriters"), for whom you are acting as representatives (the "Representatives"), an aggregate of 8,000,000 of its 7.875% Corporate HiMEDS Units (the "Equity Units") and, with respect to the grant by the Company to the Underwriters of the option described in Section 2(b) hereof, to issue and sell to the Underwriters all or any part of the Option Securities (as defined below). The aforesaid 8,000,000 Equity Units (the "Initial Securities") to be purchased by the Underwriters and all or any part of the 800,000 Equity Units subject to the option described in Section 2(b) hereof (the "Option Securities") are hereinafter called, collectively, the "Securities".

     Each Security will have a stated amount of $50 and will initially be comprised of (a) a purchase contract (a "Purchase Contract") under which the holder will purchase from the Company on or before November 15, 2010 a number of shares (the "Issuable Common Stock") of common stock, $1.00 par value, of the Company (the "Common Stock") calculated as set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement (as defined herein) and (b) a 1/20 undivided beneficial interest in a Senior Note due November 15, 2020 (the "Senior Notes") of the Company having a principal amount of $1,000.
 
     In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement to be dated as of November 20, 2007 (the "Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement") among the Company, The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as purchase contract agent (the "Purchase Contract Agent") and attorney-in-fact of the Holders from time to time and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as collateral agent, custodial agent and securities intermediary (the "Collateral Agent"), the Senior Notes constituting a part of the Securities will be pledged by the Purchase Contract Agent, on behalf of the holders of the Securities, to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Company, pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement to secure the holders' obligation to purchase the Issuable Common Stock under the Purchase Contracts. The rights and obligations of a holder of Securities in respect of Senior Notes (subject to the pledge thereof) and Purchase Contracts will initially be evidenced by a Corporate HiMEDS Units Certificate (as defined in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement).
sm
     The Senior Notes will be issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of November 20, 2007, and a First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 20, 2007, establishing the terms of the Senior Notes (together, as may be amended or supplemented, the "Indenture") in each case, between The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), and the Company.
     Pursuant to a Remarketing Agreement (the "Remarketing Agreement") described in the Prospectus (as defined herein) among the Company, the remarketing agent (the "Remarketing Agent") and the Purchase Contract Agent, the Senior Notes will be remarketed, subject to certain terms and conditions.
     The Company hereby confirms its agreement with the several Underwriters concerning the purchase and sale of the Securities, as follows:
     1. . The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Securities Act"), a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-147369), including a prospectus, relating to the Securities and Issuable Common Stock. Such registration statement, as amended at the time it becomes effective, including the information, if any, deemed pursuant to Rule 430A, 430B or 430C under the Securities Act to be part of the registration statement at the time of its effectiveness ("Rule 430 Information"), is referred to herein as the "Registration Statement"; and as used herein, the term "Preliminary Prospectus" means each prospectus included in such registration statement (and any amendments thereto) before it becomes effective, any prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(a) under the Securities Act and the prospectus included in the Registration Statement at the time of its effectiveness that omits Rule 430 Information, and the term "Prospectus" means the prospectus in the form first used (or made available upon request of purchasers pursuant to Rule 173 under the Securities Act) in connection with confirmation of sales of the Securities. If the Company has filed an abbreviated registration statement pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act (the "Rule 462 Registration Statement"), then any reference herein to the term "Registration Statement" shall be deemed to include such Rule 462 Registration Statement. Any reference in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form
Registration Statement
 
S-3 under the Securities Act, as of the effective date of the Registration Statement or the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be, and any reference to "amend", "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after such date under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act") that are deemed to be incorporated by reference therein. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.
     At or prior to the time when sales of the Securities were first made (the "Time of Sale"), the Company had prepared the following information (collectively, the "Time of Sale Information"): a Preliminary Prospectus dated November 14, 2007, and each "free-writing prospectus" (as defined pursuant to Rule 405 under the Securities Act) listed on Annex C hereto as constituting part of the Time of Sale Information.
     2. . (a) The Company agrees to issue and sell the Securities to the several Underwriters as provided in this Agreement, and each Underwriter, on the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements set forth herein and subject to the conditions set forth herein, agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company the respective number of Securities set forth opposite such Underwriter's name in Schedule 1 hereto at a price per Security (the "Purchase Price") set forth on Annex D hereto. The Company will not be obligated to deliver any of the Securities except upon payment for all the Securities to be purchased as provided herein. The public offering price of the Securities is not in excess of the price recommended by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., acting as a "qualified independent underwriter" within the meaning of Rule 2720 of the Rules of Conduct of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
Purchase of the Securities by the Underwriters
     (b) In addition, on the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company hereby grants an option to the several Underwriters to purchase up to an additional 800,000 Equity Units at the Purchase Price. The option hereby granted will expire 30 days after the date hereof and may be exercised in whole or in part, from time to time, for the sole purpose of covering sales of Securities in excess of the aggregate number of Initial Securities, upon written notice by the Representatives to the Company on any business day during such 30-day period setting forth the number of Option Securities as to which the Representatives are exercising the option and the time and date of payment and delivery for such Option Securities. Any such time and date of delivery (each, an "Additional Closing Date") shall be determined by the Representatives, but shall not be later than seven full business days after the exercise of said option, nor in any event prior to the Closing Date (as defined herein). If the option is exercised as to all or any portion of the Option Securities, each Underwriter severally and not jointly will purchase that number of Option Securities (to be adjusted by you so as to eliminate fractional shares) determined by multiplying such number of Option Securities by a fraction the numerator of which is the maximum number of Option Securities which such Underwriter is entitled to purchase and the denominator of which is the maximum number of Option Securities which all of the Underwriters are entitled to purchase hereunder. Any such election to purchase Option Securities shall be made in proportion to the maximum number of Option Securities to be sold by the Company.
 
     (d) The Company understands that the Underwriters intend to make a public offering of the Securities as soon after the effectiveness of this Agreement as in the judgment of the Representatives is advisable, and initially to offer the Securities on the terms set forth in the Prospectus. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters may offer and sell Securities to or through any affiliate of an Underwriter and that any such affiliate may offer and sell Securities purchased by it to or through any Underwriter.
     (e) Payment for and delivery of the Initial Securities will be made at the offices of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP at 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on November 20, 2007, or at such other time or place on the same or such other date, not later than the fifth business day thereafter, as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing. The time and date of such payment and delivery is referred to herein as the "Closing Date".
     (f) In addition, in the event that any or all of the Option Securities are purchased by the Underwriters, payment of the purchase price for, and delivery of certificates for, such Option Securities shall be made at the above-mentioned offices, or at such other place as shall be agreed upon by the Underwriters and the Company, on each Additional Closing Date as specified in the written notice from the Underwriters to the Company.
     (g) Payment for the Securities shall be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account(s) specified by the Company to the Representatives against delivery to the nominee of The Depository Trust Company, for the account of the Underwriters, of one or more Corporate HiMEDS Units Certificates representing the Securities, with any transfer taxes payable in connection with the sale of the Securities duly paid by the Company. The Corporate HiMEDS Units Certificates will be made available for inspection by the Representatives not later than 1:00 P.M., New York City time, on the business day prior to the Closing Date.

     (h) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, neither Representative nor any other Underwriter is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto.

     (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in Section 7(a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the following: (i) the names of the Underwriters in the table in the first paragraph under the caption "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Prospectus dated November 14, 2007 and the Prospectus; and (ii) the third, seventh (first sentence only) and eighth (first and last sentences only) paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Prospectus dated November 14, 2007 and the Prospectus.
Indemnification of the Company.
     (c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either Section 7(a) or 7(b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through

the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 7 that the Indemnifying Party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred against presentation of written invoices or statements therefor. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any controlling persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final non-appealable judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) the Indemnifying Person shall not have responded to such written request, (ii) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request on terms and conditions not less favorable than those set forth in such written request and (iii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.

     (d) If the indemnification provided for in Sections 7(a) and 7(b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution.
     (e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 7(d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 7(d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.

Morgan Securities Inc. as QIU in connection with any transaction contemplated by this Agreement or undertaken in preparing for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, except as to this clause (iii) to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability results from the gross negligence or bad faith of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. in performing the services as QIU.
     (g) . If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against the QIU in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to paragraph (f) above, the QIU shall promptly notify the Company in writing; that the failure to notify the Company shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under paragraph (f) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Company shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to the QIU otherwise than under paragraph (f) above. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against the QIU and it shall have notified the Company thereof, the Company shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the QIU (who shall not, without the consent of the QIU, be counsel to the Company) to represent the QIU and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, the QIU shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the QIU unless (i) the Company and the QIU shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Company has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the QIU; (iii) the QIU shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Company; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Company and the QIU and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. The Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Company agrees to indemnify the QIU from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time the QIU shall have requested that the Company reimburse the QIU for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Company shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is

The Company shall not, without the written consent of the QIU, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which the QIU is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by the QIU, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of the QIU, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the QIU, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of the QIU.
     (h) . If the indemnification provided for in paragraph (f) above is unavailable to the QIU or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then the Company, in lieu of indemnifying the QIU thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the QIU as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the QIU on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the QIU on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the QIU on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities, as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the QIU. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the QIU on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the QIU and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution With Respect to Indemnification of the QIU
     (i) . The Company and the QIU agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to paragraph (h) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (h) above. The amount paid or payable by the QIU as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by QIU in connection with any such action or claim. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
Limitation on Liability With Respect to Indemnification of the QIU
     (j) The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person or J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. in its capacity as QIU (and its affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls it) at law or in equity.

.
     (b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9, (ii) the Company for any reason fails to tender the Securities for delivery to the Underwriters or (iii) the Underwriters decline to purchase the Securities for any reason permitted under this Agreement, the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel to the Underwriters) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby.

     In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters of fact on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials that are furnished to the Underwriters.
     The opinion of such counsel shall be rendered to the Underwriters pursuant to the requirements of the Underwriting Agreement and shall so state therein.

     (iv) a Beneficial Owner requests to exchange such Beneficial Owner's interest in the Global Certificates for definitive Certificates in order to exercise or enforce such Beneficial Owner's rights under the HiMEDS Units represented by such Global Certificates,
then (x) definitive Certificates shall be prepared by the Company with respect to such HiMEDS Units and delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent and (y) upon surrender of the Global Certificates representing the HiMEDS Units by the Depositary, accompanied by registration instructions (other than in the case of clause (iv) above), the Company shall cause definitive Certificates to be delivered to Beneficial Owners in accordance with instructions provided by the Depositary.

In the event the payments in respect of the Pledged Treasury Securities underlying a Treasury HiMEDS Unit are in excess of the Purchase Price of the Purchase Contract being settled thereby, the Collateral Agent will distribute such excess to the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of the Holder of such Treasury HiMEDS Unit when received.
     (e) Any distribution to Holders of excess funds and interest described in Section 5.02(c) and Section 5.02(d) shall be payable at the office of the Purchase Contract Agent, or, if the HiMEDS Units do not remain in book-entry only form, at the option of the Company, by
 
check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such Person's address as it appears on the Register or by wire transfer to the account maintained in the United States designated by written notice given ten Business Days prior to the applicable payment date by such Person.
     (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the obligations of each Holder to pay the Purchase Price are non-recourse obligations and are payable solely out of the proceeds of any Collateral pledged to secure the obligations of the Holders (except to the extent paid by Cash Settlement, Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement), and in no event will Holders be liable for any deficiency between such payments and the Purchase Price.
     (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company shall not be obligated to issue any Common Stock in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder of the related HiMEDS Unit unless the Company shall have:
          (i) received payment in full of the aggregate Purchase Price for the Common Stock to be purchased thereunder by such Holder in the manner herein set forth; or
          (ii) become entitled to exercise its rights as a secured party under Section 5.02(c)(iii).
     (h) The Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that, if required by applicable law, a registration statement with regard to the full amount of the Senior Notes to be remarketed shall be effective with the Securities and Exchange Commission in a form that will enable the Remarketing Agent to rely on it in connection with such remarketing.
     Section 5.03. . (a) Unless a Termination Event, an Early Settlement or a Merger Early Settlement shall have occurred, subject to Section 5.04(b), on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date upon receipt of the aggregate Purchase Price payable on all Outstanding HiMEDS Units or, following the Last Failed Remarketing, upon the Collateral Agent retaining and cancelling the Pledged Senior Notes or selling them as directed by the Company, the Company shall issue and deposit with the Purchase Contract Agent, for the benefit of the Holders of the Outstanding HiMEDS Units, one or more certificates representing newly issued shares of Common Stock registered in the name of the Purchase Contract Agent (or its nominee) as custodian for the Holders (such certificates for shares of Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions for which a record date and payment date for such dividend or distribution has occurred after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, being hereinafter referred to as the "") to which the Holders are entitled hereunder.
Issuance of Shares of Common Stock
Purchase Contract Settlement Fund
     (b) Subject to the foregoing, upon surrender of a Certificate to the Purchase Contract Agent on or after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, together with settlement instructions thereon duly completed and executed, the Holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive forthwith in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of newly issued whole shares of Common Stock which such Holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article 5 (after taking into account all HiMEDS Units then held by such Holder), together with cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 5.08 and any dividends or distributions with respect to such shares constituting part of the Purchase Contract Settlement
 
Fund, but without any interest thereon, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Such shares shall be registered in the name of the Holder or the Holder's designee as specified in the settlement instructions provided by the Holder to the Purchase Contract Agent. If any shares of Common Stock issued in respect of a Purchase Contract are to be registered to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate evidencing such Purchase Contract is registered (but excluding any Depositary or nominee thereof), no such registration shall be made unless the Person requesting such registration has paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of such registration in a name other than that of the registered Holder of the Certificate evidencing such Purchase Contract or has established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax either has been paid or is not payable.
     Section 5.04. . (a) The Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor shall be subject to the following adjustments:
Adjustment of Low Settlement Rate, Minimum Settlement Rate and Anti-Dilution Factor
     (i) Stock Dividends. In case the Company shall issue to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock, as a dividend or other distribution, each of the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor, as in effect at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the day following the record date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be increased by dividing each of the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor by a fraction of which (a) the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the record date for such dividend or other distribution, and (b) the denominator shall be the sum of such number of outstanding shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution.
     Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 5.04(a)(i) shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the record date for such dividend or other distribution. If any dividend or distribution described in this Section 5.04(a)(i) is declared but not so paid or made, each of the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to make such dividend or distribution, to the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
     (ii) Stock Purchase Rights. In case the Company shall issue to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock rights, options, warrants or other securities, entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock for a period expiring within 45 days from the date of issuance of such rights, options, warrants or other securities at a price per share of Common Stock less than the Current Market Price of the Common Stock (other than pursuant to a dividend reinvestment, share purchase or similar plan), each of the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor in effect at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the record date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution shall be increased by dividing each of the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement
 
Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor by a fraction of which (a) the numerator shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the record date for such distribution and the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration expected to be received by the Company upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of such rights, options, warrants or securities would purchase at the Current Market Price of the Common Stock, and (b) the denominator shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the record date for such distribution and the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase, either directly or indirectly.
     Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 5.04(a)(ii) shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the record date for such distribution. In the event that such rights, options, warrants or other securities described in this Section 5.04(a)(ii) are not so distributed, the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to issue such rights, options, warrants or other securities, to the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor that would then be in effect if the record date for such distribution had not occurred. To the extent that such rights, options, warrants or other securities are not exercised prior to their expiration or shares of Common Stock are otherwise not delivered pursuant to such rights, options, warrants or other securities upon the exercise of such rights, options, warrants or other securities, the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor shall be readjusted to the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights, options, warrants or other securities been made on the basis of delivery of only the numbers of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. In determining the aggregate consideration expected to be received by the Company for such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received for such rights, options, warrants or other securities and the value of such consideration if other than cash to be determined, in good faith, by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution.
     (iii) Stock Splits; Reverse Splits; and Reclassifications. In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be split or reclassified into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, each of the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor in effect at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the day upon which such split or reclassification becomes effective shall be proportionately increased. Conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall each be split or reclassified into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, each of the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor in effect at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the day upon which such combination or reclassification becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced.
     Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 5.04(a)(iii) shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the effective date of such stock split, reverse split or reclassification.
 
     (iv) Debt, Asset or Security Distributions. (1) In case the Company shall distribute to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock, by dividend or otherwise, evidences of its indebtedness, assets (including cash) or securities, but excluding any dividend or distribution referred to in Section 5.04(a)(i), any rights, options, warrants or other securities referred to in Section 5.04(a)(ii), any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash referred to in Section 5.04(a)(v), or any Spin-Off to which the provisions in this Section 5.04(a)(iv) shall apply, each of the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor in effect at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the record date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution shall be increased by dividing each of the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor by a fraction of which (a) the numerator shall be the Current Market Price of the Common Stock minus the Fair Market Value, on the record date for such distribution, of the portion of the evidences of its indebtedness, assets (including cash) or securities so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock, and (b) the denominator shall be such Current Market Price of the Common Stock.
          (2) In the case of a Spin-Off, that is, or, when issued, will be, traded or quoted on the New York Stock Exchange or any other U.S. national or regional securities exchange or market, each of the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor in effect at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the record date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution will be increased by dividing each of the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor by a fraction of which (a) the numerator is the Current Market Price of Common Stock, and (b) the denominator is the sum of the Current Market Price of Common Stock and the Fair Market Value, as determined by the Board of Directors, of the portion of those shares of capital stock or similar equity interests so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock.
     Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 5.04(a)(iv) shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the record date for such dividend or distribution. In the event that such dividend or distribution described in this Section(a)(iv) is not so made, the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to pay such distribution, to the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor that would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared. If an adjustment to the Low Settlement rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor is required under this Section 5.04(a)(iv) during any settlement period in respect of the Purchase Contracts that have been tendered for settlement, delivery of the related settlement consideration will be delayed to the extent necessary in order to complete the calculations provided for in this Section 5.04(a)(iv).
     (v) Cash Distributions. In case the Company shall make any distribution to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, by dividend or otherwise, exclusively in cash during any quarterly period in an amount that exceeds $0.41 per share of Common Stock (such per share amount being referred to as the "") (but
Reference Dividend
 
excluding any cash that is distributed in a Reorganization Event to which Section 5.04(b) applies), each of the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor in effect at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the record date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution shall be increased by dividing each of the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor by a fraction of which (a) the numerator shall be equal to the Current Market Price of the Common Stock minus the per share amount of the cash distribution, and (b) the denominator shall be equal to the Current Market Price of Common Stock minus the Reference Dividend.
     Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 5.04(a)(v) shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the record date for such dividend or distribution. In the event that any dividend or distribution described in this Section 5.04(a)(v) is not so made, the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to pay such dividend or distribution, to the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
     (vi) Tender Offers and Exchange Offers. In the case that a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company for all or any portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender or exchange offer (as amended through the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to stockholders of the Company (based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of Purchased Shares) of an aggregate consideration having a Fair Market Value per share of the Common Stock that exceeds the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date (the "") on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, then each of the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor in effect at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Tender Expiration Date shall be increased by dividing each of the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor by a fraction of which (a) the numerator shall be equal to the product of the Current Market Price of the Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the last time tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the "") on the Tender Expiration Date, and (b) the denominator shall be equal to the sum of (x) the aggregate amount of cash and the Fair Market Value on the Tender Expiration Date of the other consideration payable for shares validly tendered or exchanged and not withdrawn as of the Tender Expiration Date (such validly tendered shares being referred to as the "") and (y) the product of (i) the Current Market Price of the Common Stock and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the Tender Expiration Time on the Tender Expiration Date.
Tender Expiration Date
Tender Expiration Time
Purchased Shares
     Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 5.04(a)(vi) shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Tender Expiration Date. In the event that the Company, or one its subsidiaries, is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange offer, but the Company, or
 
such subsidiary, is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then each of the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution factor shall be readjusted to be the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor that would then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had not been made. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, if the application of this Section 5.04(a)(vi) to any tender offer or exchange offer would result in a decrease in each of the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer or exchange offer under this Section 5.04(a)(vi). If an adjustment to each of the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor is required pursuant to this Section 5.04(a)(vi) during any settlement period in respect of Purchase Contracts that have been tendered for settlement, delivery of the related settlement consideration will be delayed to the extent necessary in order to complete the calculations provided for in this Section 5.04(a)(vi).
     (vii) Except with respect to a Spin-Off, in cases where the Fair Market Value (or the amount of cash) of assets (including cash), debt securities or certain rights, warrants or options to purchase the securities as to which Section 5.04(a)(iv) and Section 5.04(a)(v) apply, applicable to one share of Common Stock, distributed to stockholders of the Company equals or exceeds the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock over the 20 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day before the Ex-Date for such distribution, rather than being entitled to an adjustment in each of the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor, Holders will be entitled to receive upon settlement, in addition to a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the applicable Settlement Rate in effect on the applicable Settlement Date, the kind and amount of assets (including cash), debt securities or rights, warrants or options comprising the distribution that such holder would have received if such holder had settled its Purchase Contracts immediately prior to the record date for determining the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive the distribution calculated by multiplying the kind and amount of assets (including cash), debt securities or rights, warrants or options comprising the distribution by the number of shares of the Common Stock equal to the Settlement Rate in effect on the applicable Settlement Date. For this purpose only, the Settlement Rate will be calculated based on an Adjusted Applicable Market Value equal to the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock over the 20 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the third Trading Day immediately preceding the record date fixed for the determination of stockholders pf the Company entitled to receive such distribution. For the avoidance of doubt, such calculated Settlement Rate shall be applied for this purpose only and shall not be applicable in connection with the calculation of the Settlement Rate for purposes of determining the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in connection with the settlement of the Purchase Contracts.
     (viii) Calculation of Adjustments. All adjustments to the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor shall be calculated to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share of Common Stock. No adjustment in the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate or the Anti-Dilution Factor shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent therein;
 
, that any adjustments which by reason of this Section 5.04(a)(viii) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment; and that effect shall be given to anti-dilution adjustments not later than (i) the first Trading Day of the 20 consecutive Trading Day period used to calculate the Adjusted Applicable Market Value for purposes of calculating the Settlement Rate in connection with the earlier of a Merger Early Settlement Date or the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, or (ii) upon Early Settlement.
provided
provided, further,
     (ix) Increase of Settlement Rate. The Company may make such increases in the Settlement Rate, in addition to those required by this Section 5.04(a), as the Board of Directors considers advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for shares of Common Stock or from any event treated as a dividend or distribution for income tax purposes or for any other reasons.
     (x) Rights. If the Company hereafter adopts any stockholder rights plan involving the issuance of preference share purchase rights or other similar rights (the "") to all holders of the Common Stock, a Holder shall be entitled to receive upon settlement of any Purchase Contract, in addition to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon settlement of such Purchase Contract, the related Rights for the Common Stock, unless, prior to such Settlement Date, such Rights under the future stockholder rights plan have separated from the Common Stock at the time of conversion, in which case the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor shall be adjusted as provided in Section 5.04(a)(iv) on the date such Rights separate from the Common Stock, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such Rights.
Rights
     (b) Adjustment for Consolidation, Merger or Other Reorganization Event. (i) Upon a Reorganization Event, each HiMEDS Unit shall thereafter, in lieu of a variable number of shares of Common Stock, be settled by delivery of Exchange Property Units. An "" represents the right to receive the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable in such Reorganization Event (without any interest thereon, and without any right to dividends or distributions thereon which have a record date that is prior to the applicable Settlement Date) per share of Common Stock by a holder of Common Stock that is not a Person with which the Company consolidated or into which the Company merged or which merged into the Company or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (any such Person, a ""), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Reorganization Event provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Company and non-Affiliates. In the event holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such transaction, the Exchange Property Unit that Holders of the Corporate HiMEDS Units or Treasury HiMEDS Units would have been entitled to receive will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make an election. If an Exchange Property Unit includes property other than common stock, upon settlement, the Company may elect to deliver additional shares of common stock in lieu of such other property; the number of such additional shares of common stock will be equal to the Applicable Market Value of such other property
Exchange Property Unit
Constituent Person
 
divided by the Applicable Market Value per share of such common stock. The Company may only deliver additional shares of common stock in lieu of such other property if the Company provides notice to the Holders of the Company's election to do so at least three Business Days prior to the first Trading Day that will be included in the calculation of Applicable Market Value used for purposes of determining the Settlement Rate applicable to such settlement. The Company hereby covenants and agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such shares of common stock delivered in lieu of such other property on the applicable Settlement Date to be freely transferable under the U.S. Federal securities laws by the recipients thereof upon delivery thereto, including, if necessary, causing one or more registration statements in respect of such shares of common stock to be filed with and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
          In the event of such a Reorganization Event, the Person formed by such consolidation or merger or the Person which acquires the assets and property of the Company shall execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent an agreement supplemental hereto providing that the Holder of each HiMEDS Unit that remains outstanding after the Reorganization Event (if any) shall have the rights provided by this Section 5.04(b)(i). Such supplemental agreement shall provide for adjustments to the amount of any securities constituting all or a portion of an Exchange Property Unit which, for events subsequent to the effective date of such Reorganization Event, shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 5.04. The above provisions of this Section 5.04(b)(i) shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events.
          (ii) Prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, if the Company enters into a consolidation, acquisition or merger in which 10% or more of the total consideration paid for the Common Stock consists of cash or cash equivalents (a ""), then following such Cash Merger a Holder will have the right to accelerate and settle ("") its Purchase Contract, upon the conditions set forth below, at the Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the closing of the Cash Merger, , for purposes of calculating this Settlement Rate, the Applicable Market Value shall mean the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock over the 20 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date on which the Cash Merger becomes effective (the ""), and the Company will increase the applicable Settlement Rate by a number of an additional shares (such additional number of shares being referred to as the ""); that no Merger Early Settlement will be permitted pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(ii) unless, at the time such Merger Early Settlement is effected, there is an effective Registration Statement with respect to any securities to be issued and delivered in connection with such Merger Early Settlement, if such a Registration Statement is required (in the view of counsel, which need not be in the form of a written opinion, for the Company) under the Securities Act. If such a Registration Statement is so required, the Company covenants and agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to (x) have in effect a Registration Statement covering any securities to be delivered in respect of the Purchase Contracts being settled and (y) provide a Prospectus in connection therewith, in each case in a form that may be used in connection with such Merger Early Settlement. In the event that a Holder seeks to exercise its Merger Early Settlement right and a Registration Statement is required to be effective in connection with the exercise of such right but no such Registration Statement is then effective, the Holder's exercise of such right shall be void unless and until such a Registration Statement

shall be effective and the Company shall have no further obligation with respect to any such Registration Statement if, notwithstanding using its commercially reasonable efforts, no Registration Statement is then effective.
          If a Holder elects a Merger Early Settlement of some or all of its Purchase Contracts, such Holder shall be entitled to receive, on the Merger Early Settlement Date, the aggregate amount of any accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments including and any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, in each case, to but not including the Merger Early Settlement Date (unless the Merger Early Settlement occurs after the Record Date for such Contract Adjustment Payments or Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments), with respect to such Purchase Contracts. The Company shall pay such amount as a credit against the amount otherwise payable by such Holder to effect such Merger Early Settlement.
          Within five Business Days of the Effective Date, the Company shall provide written notice to Holders of HiMEDS Units of such completion of a Cash Merger, which shall specify:
          (1) the deadline for submitting the notice to settle early in cash pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(ii) and how and where such notice to settle early should be delivered;
          (2) the date on which such Merger Early Settlement shall occur (which date shall be no later than the earlier of 21 Business Days after the date of such notice or two Business Days prior to the Remarketing Date) (the "");
Merger Early Settlement Date
          (3) the amount of cash payable in respect of the exercise of such Merger Early Settlement (giving effect to the credit for any accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments including and any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments as provided in the preceding paragraph);
          (4) the applicable Settlement Rate;
          (5) the number of Make-Whole Shares by which the applicable settlement rate will be increased; and
          (6) the amount (per share of Common Stock) of cash, securities and other consideration receivable by the Holder upon settlement, including any amount of Contract Adjustment Payments and Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, in each case, to but not including the Merger Early Settlement Date (to the extent that such Contract Adjustment Payments and Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments are not credited as provided in the preceding paragraph).
          Corporate HiMEDS Units Holders and Treasury HiMEDS Units Holders may only effect Merger Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(ii) in integral multiples of 20 Corporate HiMEDS Units or Treasury HiMEDS Units, as the case may be. Other than the provisions relating to timing of notice and settlement, which shall be as set forth above, the provisions of Section 5.01 shall apply with respect to a Merger Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(ii).
 
          In order to exercise the right to effect Merger Early Settlement with respect to any Purchase Contracts, the Holder of the Certificate evidencing HiMEDS Units shall deliver, no later than 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the Merger Early Settlement Date, such Certificate, if in certificated form, to the Purchase Contract Agent at the Corporate Trust Office duly endorsed for transfer to the Company or in blank with the form of Election to Settle Early/Merger Early Settlement on the reverse thereof duly completed and accompanied by payment (payable to the Company in immediately available funds) in an amount equal to the sum of:
          (i) product of (A) the Stated Amount and (B) the number of Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder has elected to effect Merger Early Settlement,
less
          (ii) the amount of any accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments and any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, in each case, to but not including the Merger Early Settlement Date (excluding, if the Merger Early Settlement occurs after the Record Date for such Contract Adjustment Payments or Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, the amount of such payments to be made on the Payment Date immediately succeeding such Record Date).
          In the event that HiMEDS Units are held by or through DTC or another Depositary, the exercise of the right to effect Merger Early Settlement shall occur in conformity with the procedures established by DTC or such Depositary.
          Upon receipt of any such Certificate and payment of such funds, the Purchase Contract Agent shall pay the Company from such funds the related Purchase Price pursuant to the terms of the related Purchase Contracts, and notify the Collateral Agent that all the conditions necessary for a Merger Early Settlement by a Holder of HiMEDS Units have been satisfied pursuant to which the Purchase Contract Agent has received from such Holder, and paid to the Company as confirmed in writing by the Company, the related Purchase Price.
          Upon receipt by the Collateral Agent of the notice from the Purchase Contract Agent set forth in the preceding paragraph, the Collateral Agent shall release from the Pledge, (1) the Pledged Senior Notes, in the case of a Holder of Corporate HiMEDS Units, or (2) Pledged Treasury Securities, in the case of a Holder of Treasury HiMEDS Units, in each case with a Value equal to the product of (x) the Stated Amount and (y) the number of Purchase Contracts as to which such Holder has elected to effect Merger Early Settlement, and shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to Transfer all such Pledged Senior Notes or Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, to the Purchase Contract Agent for distribution to such Holder, in each case free and clear of the Pledge created hereby.
     If a Holder properly effects an effective Merger Early Settlement in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.04(b)(ii), the Company will deliver (or will cause the Collateral Agent to deliver) to the Holder on the Merger Early Settlement Date:
 
     (A) the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Cash Merger by a Holder of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on account of each Purchase Contract if the Purchase Contract Settlement Date had occurred immediately prior to such Cash Merger (based on the Settlement Rate in effect at such time plus the Make-Whole Shares), assuming such Holder of Common Stock is not a Constituent Person or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Cash Merger provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Company and non-Affiliates. In the event holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in the Cash Merger, the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable by Holders of the Corporate HiMEDS Units or Treasury HiMEDS Units exercising their Merger Early Settlement right will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make an election. For the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of determining the Applicable Market Value (in connection with determining the appropriate Settlement Rate to be applied in the foregoing sentence), the Effective Date of the Cash Merger shall be deemed to be the Purchase Contract Settlement Date;
     (B) the Senior Notes or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, related to the Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder is effecting a Merger Early Settlement;
     (C) any accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments and any deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, in each case, to but not including the cash merger settlement date (to the extent such payments are not offset to settle the Purchase Contracts); and
     (D) if so required under the Securities Act, a Prospectus as contemplated by this Section 5.04(b)(ii).
          The Corporate HiMEDS Units or the Treasury HiMEDS Units of the Holders who do not elect Merger Early Settlement in accordance Section 5.04(b)(ii) will continue to remain outstanding and be subject to settlement on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date in accordance with the terms hereof.
          (iii) The number of Make-Whole Shares by which the applicable Settlement Rate will be increased with respect to a Merger Early Settlement will be determined by reference to the table below, based on the Effective Date and the price (the "") paid per share for Common Stock in such Cash Merger. If holders of Common Stock receive only cash in such transaction, the Stock Price paid per share will be the cash amount paid per share. Otherwise, the Stock Price paid per share will be the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock over the 20 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Effective Date of such Cash Merger.
Stock Price
 
          In the event that the Stock Price and/or Effective Date applicable to a Cash Merger is not expressly set forth on the table, then the Make-Whole Shares will be determined as follows:
     (1) if the Stock Price is between two Stock Prices on the table or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates on the table, the Make-Whole Shares will be determined by straight-line interpolation between the Make-Whole Shares set forth for the higher and lower Stock Prices and the two Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;
     (2) if the Stock Price is in excess of $256.25 per share (subject to adjustment as described above), then the Make-Whole Shares will be zero; and
     (3) if the Stock Price is less than $10.25 per share (subject to adjustment) (the ""), then the Make-Whole Shares will be determined as if the Stock Price equaled the Minimum Stock Price, using straight-line interpolation, as described herein, if the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates on the above table.
Minimum Stock Price
          The Stock Prices set forth in the first row of the table (, the column headers) will be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events requiring anti-dilution adjustments to the Low Settlement Rate, Minimum Settlement Rate and Anti-Dilution Factor pursuant to Section 5.04(a). The adjusted Stock Prices will equal the Stock Prices divided by the Anti-Dilution Factor. The Make-Whole Shares set forth in the table will also be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of the anti-dilution adjustment events and in the same manner as the Minimum Settlement Rate as set forth in Section 5.04(a).
i.e.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no circumstances will the total shares deliverable (i.e., the sum of the applicable Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date plus the Make-Whole Shares) exceed 1.5830 (subject to adjustment).
     (c) No adjustment to the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate or the Anti-Dilution Factor need be made if Holders may participate in the transaction that would otherwise give rise to an adjustment. For the avoidance of doubt, in order for Holders to have been deemed to have participated in such transaction, Holders must receive the same kind and
 
amount of property as holders of Common Stock on the same date as holders of Common Stock. For purposes of determining the amount of such property Holders are entitled to receive as a result of such transaction only, a Settlement Rate will be calculated based on an Adjusted Applicable Market Value equal to the average of the Closing Prices per share of Common Stock over the 20 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the third Trading Day immediately preceding the record date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution. For the avoidance of doubt, such calculated Settlement Rate shall be applied for this purpose only and shall not be applicable in connection with the calculation of the Settlement Rate for purposes of determining the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in connection with the settlement of the Purchase Contracts.
     (d) If:
          (i) the record date for a dividend or distribution on Common Stock occurs after the end of the 20 consecutive Trading Day period used for calculating the Adjusted Applicable Market Value and before the Purchase Contract Settlement Date; and
          (ii) such dividend or distribution would have resulted in an adjustment of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable to the Holders had such record date occurred on or before the last Trading Day of such 20-Trading Day period,
then the Company shall deem the Holders to be holders of record of Common Stock for purposes of that dividend or distribution. In this case, the Holders would receive the dividend or distribution on Common Stock together with the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the Purchase Contract Settlement Date.
     (e) The Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor shall not be adjusted:
     (f) Promptly after the calculation of the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor the Company shall give the Purchase Contract Agent notice thereof accompanied by an Officers' Certificate setting forth the bases for the
 
calculation in reasonable detail. All calculations and determinations of the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor shall be made by the Company or its agent based on their good faith calculations and the Purchase Contract Agent shall bear no responsibility with respect thereto.
     Section 5.05. . (a) Whenever the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor are adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall within 10 Business Days following the occurrence of an event that requires such adjustment pursuant to Section 5.04 (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware):
Notice of Adjustments and Certain Other Events
     (i) compute each adjusted Low Settlement Rate, Minimum Settlement Rate and Anti-Dilution Factor in accordance with Section 5.04 and prepare and transmit to the Purchase Contract Agent an Officers' Certificate setting forth such adjusted Low Settlement Rate, Minimum Settlement Rate and Anti-Dilution Factor, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based; and
     (ii) provide a written notice to the Holders of the HiMEDS Units of the occurrence of such event and a statement in reasonable detail setting forth the method by which the adjustment to the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor was determined and setting forth each adjusted Low Settlement Rate, Minimum Settlement Rate and Anti-Dilution Factor.
     (b) The Purchase Contract Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of HiMEDS Units to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Low Settlement Rate, the Minimum Settlement Rate and the Anti-Dilution Factor, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed in making the same. The Purchase Contract Agent shall be fully authorized and protected in relying on any Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 5.05(a)(i) and any adjustment contained therein and the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment unless and until it has received such certificate. The Purchase Contract Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at the time be issued or delivered with respect to any Purchase Contract; and the Purchase Contract Agent makes no representation with respect thereto. The Purchase Contract Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to a Purchase Contract or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article.
     Section 5.06. The Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any Contract Adjustment Payments (including any accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments and any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments), and the rights and obligations of Holders to purchase Common Stock, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent or the Company, if, prior to or on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred.
Termination Event; Notice.
 
     Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the HiMEDS Units shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Senior Notes or the Treasury Securities, as the case may be, forming part of such Units, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.15. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register.
     Section 5.07. . (a) Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.07 and the last sentence of this Section 5.07(a), at the option of the Holder thereof, Purchase Contracts underlying HiMEDS Units may be settled early ("") at any time on or prior to 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the first scheduled Trading Day of the Observation Period; that no Early Settlement will be permitted pursuant to this Section 5.07 unless, at the time such Early Settlement is effected, there is an effective Registration Statement with respect to any securities to be issued and delivered in connection with such Early Settlement, if such a Registration Statement is required (in the view of counsel, which need not be in the form of a written opinion, for the Company) under the Securities Act. In the event that a Holder seeks to exercise its right to early settle Purchase Contracts and a Registration Statement is required to be effective in connection with the exercise of such right but no such Registration Statement is then effective, the Holder's exercise of such right shall be void unless and until such a Registration Statement shall be effective. If such a Registration Statement is so required, the Company covenants and agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) have in effect a Registration Statement covering any securities to be delivered in respect of the Purchase Contracts being settled and (ii) provide a Prospectus in connection therewith, in each case in a form that may be used in connection with such Early Settlement. The Company shall have no further obligation with respect to any such Registration Statement if, notwithstanding using its commercially reasonable efforts, no Registration Statement is then effective.

     (iii) the amount of any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments accrued and unpaid to but not including the Payment Date immediately preceding the Early Settlement Date.
     Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, no payment shall be made upon Early Settlement of any Purchase Contract on account of any Contract Adjustment Payments accrued on such Purchase Contract or on account of any dividends on the Common Stock issued upon such Early Settlement. If the foregoing requirements are first satisfied with respect to Purchase Contracts underlying any HiMEDS Units on or prior to 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on a Business Day, such day shall be the "" with respect to such HiMEDS Units and if such requirements are first satisfied after 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on a Business Day or on a day that is not a Business Day, the "" with respect to such HiMEDS Units shall be the next succeeding Business Day.

     (B) the Purchase Contract Agent has received from such Holder, and paid to the Company as confirmed in writing by the Company, the related Early Settlement Amount; and
     (C) all conditions to such Early Settlement have been satisfied.
     Upon receipt by the Collateral Agent of the notice from the Purchase Contract Agent set forth in the preceding paragraph, the Collateral Agent shall release from the Pledge, (1) the Pledged Senior Notes, in the case of a Holder of Corporate HiMEDS Units or (2) Pledged Treasury Securities, in the case of a Holder of Treasury HiMEDS Units, in each case with a Value equal to the product of (x) the Stated Amount and (y) the number of Purchase Contracts as to which such Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement, and shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to Transfer all such Pledged Senior Notes or Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, to the Purchase Contract Agent for distribution to such Holder, in each case free and clear of the Pledge created hereby.
     Holders of HiMEDS Units may only effect Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.07 in integral multiples of 20 HiMEDS Units.
     Upon Early Settlement of the Purchase Contracts, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any Contract Adjustment Payments (including any accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments) with respect to such Purchase Contracts shall immediately and automatically terminate.
 
     (c) Upon Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related HiMEDS Units, the Company shall issue, and the Holder shall be entitled to receive, a number of shares of Common Stock (or in the case of an Early Settlement following a Reorganization Event, a number of units of Exchange Property) equal to the Minimum Settlement Rate for each Purchase Contract as to which Early Settlement is effected.
     (d) No later than the third Business Day after the applicable Early Settlement Date, the Company shall cause the shares of Common Stock issuable upon Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts to be issued and delivered, together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided in Section 5.08.

     (i) transfer to the Holder the Senior Notes or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, forming a part of such HiMEDS Units free and clear of the security interest, and
     (ii) deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates for the full number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Early Settlement, together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided in Section 5.08.
     (f) The Company shall, if so required under the Securities Act, deliver a Prospectus for the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Early Settlement as contemplated by Section 5.07(a).
     (g) In the event that Early Settlement is effected with respect to Purchase Contracts underlying less than all the HiMEDS Units evidenced by a Certificate, upon such Early Settlement the Company shall execute and the Purchase Contract Agent shall execute on behalf of the Holder, authenticate and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a Certificate evidencing the HiMEDS Units as to which Early Settlement was not effected.
     (h) A Holder of a HiMEDS Unit who effects Early Settlement may elect to have the Senior Notes no longer a part of a Corporate HiMEDS Unit remarketed in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.02.
     Section 5.08. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued or delivered upon settlement on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, or upon Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement of any Purchase Contracts. If Certificates evidencing more than one Purchase Contract shall be surrendered for settlement at one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock which shall be delivered upon settlement shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of Purchase Contracts evidenced by the Certificates so surrendered. Instead of any fractional share of Common Stock which would otherwise be deliverable upon settlement of any Purchase Contracts on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, or upon Early Settlement or Merger Early

The Company shall provide the Purchase Contract Agent from time to time with sufficient funds to permit the Purchase Contract Agent to make all cash payments required by this Section 5.08 in a timely manner.
     Section 5.09. The Company will pay all stock transfer and similar taxes attributable to the initial issuance and delivery of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Purchase Contracts; that the Company shall not be required to pay any such tax or taxes which may be payable in respect of any exchange of or substitution for a Certificate evidencing a HiMEDS Unit or any issuance of a share of Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered Holder of a Certificate surrendered in respect of the HiMEDS Units evidenced thereby, other than in the name of the Purchase Contract Agent, as custodian for such Holder, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such share certificates or Certificates unless or until the Person or Persons requesting the transfer or issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid.
Charges and Taxes.
provided, however,
     Section 5.10. . (a) Subject to Section 5.10(d) and 5.11, the Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Adjustment Payments payable in respect of each Purchase Contract to the Person in whose name a Certificate is registered at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date relating to such Payment Date. The Contract Adjustment Payments will be payable at the office of the Purchase Contract Agent maintained for that purpose. If the book-entry system for the HiMEDS Units has been terminated, the Contract Adjustment Payments will be payable, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such Person's address as it appears on the Security Register, or by wire transfer to the account designated by such Person by a prior written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent. Contract Adjustment Payments payable for any period will be computed (1) for any full quarterly period on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and (2) for any period other than a full quarterly period on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and a 360-day year. Contract Adjustment Payments will accrue from November 20, 2007.
Contract Adjustment Payments
     (b) Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company's obligation to pay future Contract Adjustment Payments (including any accrued Contract Adjustment Payments) and any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments shall cease.
     (c) Each Certificate delivered under this Agreement upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of (including as a result of a Collateral Substitution or the recreation of Corporate HiMEDS Units) any other Certificate shall carry the right to accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments and Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, which right was carried by the Purchase Contracts underlying such other Certificates.
 
     (d) In the case of any HiMEDS Unit with respect to which Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement of the underlying Purchase Contract is effected on a date that is after any Record Date and prior to or on the next succeeding Payment Date, Contract Adjustment Payments and Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments otherwise payable on such Payment Date shall be payable on such Payment Date notwithstanding such Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, and such Contract Adjustment Payments and Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments shall be paid to the Person in whose name the Certificate evidencing such HiMEDS Unit is registered at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Record Date. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence, and the right to receive accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments as set forth in Section 5.04(b)(ii), in the case of any HiMEDS Unit with respect to which Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement of the underlying Purchase Contract is effected, Contract Adjustment Payments (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments) that would otherwise be payable after the Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement Date with respect to such Purchase Contract shall not be payable.
     (e) The Company's obligations with respect to Contract Adjustment Payments and Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, will be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the Company's obligations under any Senior Indebtedness.
     (f) In the event:
          (x) of any payment by, or distribution of assets of, the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to creditors upon any dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary or in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other proceedings; or
          (y) subject to the provisions of Section 5.10(h), that (i) a default shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to the payment of principal, interest or any other monetary amounts due and payable on any Senior Indebtedness and such default shall have continued beyond the period of grace, if any, specified in the instrument evidencing such Senior Indebtedness (and the Purchase Contract Agent shall have received written notice thereof from the Company or one or more holders of Senior Indebtedness or their representative or representatives or the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued) or (ii) the maturity of any Senior Indebtedness shall have been accelerated because of a default in respect of such Senior Indebtedness (and the Purchase Contract Agent shall have received written notice thereof from the Company or one or more holders of Senior Indebtedness or their representative or representatives or the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued),
then:
     (i) the holders of all Senior Indebtedness shall first be entitled to receive, in the case of clause (x) above, payment of all amounts due or to become due upon all Senior Indebtedness and, in the case of subclauses (i) and (ii) of clause (y) above, payment of all amounts due thereon, or provision shall be made for such payment in money or money's worth, before the Holders of any of the HiMEDS Units are entitled to receive any Contract Adjustment Payments or Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts underlying the HiMEDS Units;
 
     (ii) any payment by, or distribution of assets of, the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to which the Holders of any of the HiMEDS Units would be entitled except for the provisions of Section 5.10(e) through (q), including any such payment or distribution which may be payable or deliverable by reason of the payment of any other indebtedness of the Company being subordinated to the payment of such Contract Adjustment Payments or Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts underlying the HiMEDS Units, shall be paid or delivered by the Person making such payment or distribution, whether a trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver or liquidating trustee or otherwise, directly to the representative or representatives of the holders of Senior Indebtedness or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture under which any instruments evidencing any of such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, ratably according to the aggregate amounts remaining unpaid on account of such Senior Indebtedness held or represented by each, to the extent necessary to make payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution (or provision therefor) to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, before any payment or distribution is made of such Contract Adjustment Payments or Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments to the Holders of such HiMEDS Units; and
     (iii) in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment by, or distribution of assets of, the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, including any such payment or distribution which may be payable or deliverable by reason of the payment of any other indebtedness of the Company being subordinated to the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments or Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts underlying the HiMEDS Units, shall be received by the Purchase Contract Agent or the Holders of any of the HiMEDS Units when such payment or distribution is prohibited pursuant to Section 5.10(e) through (q), such payment or distribution shall be paid over to the representative or representatives of the holders of Senior Indebtedness or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any instruments evidencing any such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, ratably as aforesaid, for application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid until all such Senior Indebtedness shall have been paid in full, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution (or provision therefor) to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness.
     (g) For purposes of Section 5.10(e) through (q), the words "cash, property or securities" shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of the Company as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other Person provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment, the payment of which is subordinated at least to the extent provided in Section 5.10(e) through (q) with respect to such Contract Adjustment Payments or Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments on the HiMEDS Units to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness which may at the time be outstanding; that (i) the indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness, as the case may be, that constitutes Senior Indebtedness is assumed by the Person, if any, resulting from any such reorganization or readjustment, and (ii) the rights of the holders of the Senior Indebtedness are not, without the consent of each such holder adversely affected thereby, altered by such reorganization or readjustment;
provided
 
     (h) Any failure by the Company to make any payment on or perform any other obligation under Senior Indebtedness, other than any indebtedness incurred by the Company or assumed or guaranteed, directly or indirectly, by the Company for money borrowed (or any deferral, renewal, extension or refunding thereof) or any indebtedness or obligation as to which the provisions of Section 5.10(e) through (q) shall have been waived by the Company in the instrument or instruments by which the Company incurred, assumed, guaranteed or otherwise created such indebtedness or obligation, shall not be deemed a default or event of default if (i) the Company shall be disputing its obligation to make such payment or perform such obligation and (ii) either (A) no final judgment relating to such dispute shall have been issued against the Company which is in full force and effect and is not subject to further review, including a judgment that has become final by reason of the expiration of the time within which a party may seek further appeal or review, and (B) in the event a judgment that is subject to further review or appeal has been issued, the Company shall in good faith be prosecuting an appeal or other proceeding for review and a stay of execution shall have been obtained pending such appeal or review.
     (i) Subject to the irrevocable payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, the Holders of the HiMEDS Units shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with the holders of all obligations of the Company which by their express terms are subordinated to Senior Indebtedness of the Company to the same extent as payment of the Contract Adjustment Payments and Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments in respect of the Purchase Contracts underlying the HiMEDS Units is subordinated and which are entitled to like rights of subrogation) to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the Company applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until all such Contract Adjustment Payments and Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments owing on the HiMEDS Units shall be paid in full, and as between the Company, its creditors other than holders of such Senior Indebtedness and the Holders, no such payment or distribution made to the holders of Senior Indebtedness by virtue of Section 5.10(e) through (q) that otherwise would have been made to the Holders shall be deemed to be a payment by the Company on account of such Senior Indebtedness, it being understood that the provisions of Section 5.10(e) through (q) are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders, on the one hand, and the holders of Senior Indebtedness, on the other hand.
     (j) Nothing contained in Section 5.10(e) through (q) or elsewhere in this Agreement or in the HiMEDS Units is intended to or shall impair, as among the Company, its creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Holders, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the Holders such Contract Adjustment Payments and Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments on the HiMEDS Units as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights of the Holders and creditors of the Company other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Purchase Contract Agent or any Holder from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Agreement, subject to the rights, if any, under Section 5.10(e) through (q), of the holders of Senior Indebtedness in respect of cash, property or securities of the Company received upon the exercise of any such remedy.
 
     (k) Upon payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in Section 5.10(e) through (q), the Purchase Contract Agent and the Holders shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction in which any such dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization proceeding affecting the affairs of the Company is pending or upon a certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidating trustee or Purchase Contract Agent or other person making any payment or distribution, delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent or to the Holders, for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of the Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to these Section 5.10(e) through (q).
     (l) The Purchase Contract Agent shall be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself to be a holder of Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee or representative on behalf of such holder) to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of Senior Indebtedness or a trustee or representative on behalf of any such holder or holders. In the event that the Purchase Contract Agent determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to Section 5.10(e) through (q), the Purchase Contract Agent may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Purchase Contract Agent as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under Section 5.10(e) through (q), and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Purchase Contract Agent may defer payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment.
     (m) Nothing contained in Section 5.10(e) through (q) shall affect the obligations of the Company to make, or prevent the Company from making, payment of the Contract Adjustment Payments and Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, except as otherwise provided in these Section 5.10(e) through (q).
     (n) Each Holder of HiMEDS Units, by its acceptance thereof, authorizes and directs the Purchase Contract Agent on its behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provided in Section 5.10(e) through (q) and appoints the Purchase Contract Agent its attorney-in-fact, as the case may be, for any and all such purposes.

Upon receipt by the Security Custodian and Registrar of instructions from the holder of a Global Security directing the Security Custodian and Registrar to (x) issue one or more individual Securities in the amounts specified to the owner of a beneficial interest in such Global Security and (y) debit or cause to be debited an equivalent amount of beneficial interest in such Global Security, subject to the rules and regulations of the Depositary:

The Trustee shall deliver such Registered Securities to the Persons in whose names such Registered Securities are so registered.
     (d) All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be valid obligations of the Company evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same
 
benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered for such registration of transfer or exchange.
     (e) Every Registered Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer, or for exchange or payment shall (if so required by the Company, the Trustee or the Registrar) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee and the Registrar, duly executed by the holder thereof or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing.

Upon any such waiver the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Securities of such series shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any holder of the Securities of any series to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Default or Event of Default shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Default or Event of Default or an acquiescence therein; and every power and remedy given by this Article VII to the Trustee and to the holders of Securities of any series, respectively, may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient by the Trustee or by the holders of Securities of such series, as the case may be.

Any such record date shall be fixed at the Company's discretion. If such a record date is fixed, such action may be sought or given before or after the record date, but only the holders of Registered Securities of record at the close of business on such record date shall be deemed to be holders of Registered Securities for the purpose of determining whether holders of the requisite proportion of Outstanding Securities of such series have authorized or agreed or consented to such action, and for that purpose the Outstanding Registered Securities of such series shall be computed as of such record date.

Rights of Trustees; Compensation and Indemnity
     (a) The Trustee shall be entitled to such compensation as the Company and the Trustee shall from time to time agree for all services rendered by it hereunder (including in any agent capacity in which it acts). The compensation of the Trustee shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee promptly upon its request for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee (including the reasonable expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to its negligence or willful misconduct.
     The Company also agrees to indemnify each of the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee hereunder for, and to hold it harmless against, any and all loss, liability, damage, claim, or expense incurred without its own negligence or willful misconduct, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the trust or trusts hereunder and the performance of its duties (including in any agent capacity in which it acts), as well as the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall cooperate in the
 
defense. The Trustee may have one separate counsel and the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Notwithstanding any provisions of this Indenture to the contrary, the obligations of the Company to compensate and indemnify the Trustee under this Section 11.01(a) shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee and any satisfaction and discharge under Article XII. When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default specified in clause (e) or (f) of Section 7.01 occurs, the expenses and compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws.
     (b) The Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereof and perform any duty hereunder either directly or by its agents and attorneys and shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder.

Section 10.
Remarketing Agent's Performance; Duty of Care.
     The duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agent shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents. No implied covenants or obligations of or against the Remarketing Agent shall be read into this Agreement or any of the Transactions Documents. In the absence of willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence on the part of the Remarketing Agent, the Remarketing Agent may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to it which purports to conform to the requirements hereunder as to the truth of the statements expressed therein. The Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to be signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties. The Remarketing Agent shall not have any obligation to determine whether there is any limitation under applicable law on the Reset Rate on the Remarketed Senior Notes or, if there is any such limitation, the maximum permissible Reset Rate on the Remarketed Senior Notes, and it shall rely solely upon timely written notice from the Company pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof as to whether or not there is any such limitation and, if so, the maximum permissible Reset Rate.

The provisions of this Section 10 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall also continue to apply to every Remarketing Agent notwithstanding its resignation or removal. The Remarketing Agent will act as the agent of the Holders.
Section 11.
Indemnification.
     (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless the Remarketing Agent, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Remarketing Agent may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue
 
statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplement thereto, or any related Preliminary Prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse the Remarketing Agent for any legal expenses of one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) engaged reasonably incurred by the Remarketing Agent in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Remarketing Agent specifically for use therein.
provided, however
     (b) The Remarketing Agent will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related Preliminary Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus supplement, or any other Remarketing Materials, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Remarketing Agent specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; that in no case will the Remarketing Agent be liable or responsible for any amount in excess of the fee paid to the Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 4.
provided
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to subsection (a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Remarketing Agent. In case any such action shall be brought against the indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified
 
party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation (as set forth below). Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or the indemnified party which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 11 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Section 12.
Contribution.
     (a) If the indemnification provided for in Section 11 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Sections 11(a) or 11(b), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other from the offering of the Remarketed Senior Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other in connection with the statements of omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other hand in connection with the Remarketing shall be deemed to be in the same proportions as the total net proceeds of the Remarketed Senior Notes less the fee paid to the Remarketing Agent on the one hand and the fee paid to the Remarketing Agent on the other hand bear to the total net proceeds of the Remarketed Senior Notes. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the
 
Company on the one hand or the Remarketing Agent on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Remarketing Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (a) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (a). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (a) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.

The Securities are being issued pursuant to an underwriting agreement, dated as of November 14, 2007, among the Company and the underwriters identified in the Prospectus (the ""), in the form attached as an exhibit to a current report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on the date hereof (the "").

Statement or the Prospectus, other than as expressly stated herein with respect to the issue of the Purchase Contracts and the Senior Notes.
     As such counsel, we have examined such matters of fact and questions of law as we have considered appropriate for purposes of this letter. With your consent, we have relied upon certificates and other assurances of officers of the Company and others as to factual matters without having independently verified such factual matters. We are opining herein as to the internal laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and we express no opinion with respect to the applicability thereto, or the effect thereon, of the laws of any other jurisdiction or, in the case of Delaware, any other laws or as to any matters of municipal law or the laws of any local agency within any state.
     Subject to the foregoing and the other matters set forth herein, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof:
     (1) The Purchase Contracts have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company, and when duly executed, authenticated and issued in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, and when delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute legally valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
     (2) The Senior Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company, and when duly executed, authenticated and issued in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture, and when delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute legally valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
     Our opinions are subject to: (i) the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, preference, fraudulent transfer, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors; (ii) the effect of general principles of equity, whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law (including the possible unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief), concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and the discretion of the court before which a proceeding is brought; (iii) the invalidity under certain circumstances under law or court decisions of provisions providing for the indemnification of or contribution to a party with respect to a liability where such indemnification or contribution is contrary to public policy; and (iv) we express no opinion with respect to (a) any provision for liquidated damages, default interest, late charges, monetary penalties or other economic remedies to the extent such provisions are deemed to constitute a penalty, (b) consents to, or restrictions upon, governing law, jurisdiction, venue, arbitration, remedies, or judicial relief, (c) the waiver of rights or defenses contained in Section 7.07 of the Supplemental Indenture and Section 6.06 of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, (d) any provision requiring the payment of attorneys' fees, where such payment is contrary to law or public policy, (e) any provision permitting, upon acceleration of the Senior Notes, collection of that portion of the stated principal amount thereof which might be determined to

constitute unearned interest thereon, (f) the creation, validity, attachment, perfection, or priority of any lien or security interest, (g) advance waivers of claims, defenses, rights granted by law, or notice, opportunity for hearing, evidentiary requirements, statutes of limitation, trial by jury or at law, or other procedural rights, (h) waivers of broadly or vaguely stated rights, (i) provisions for exclusivity, election or cumulation of rights or remedies, (j) provisions authorizing or validating conclusive or discretionary determinations, (k) grants of setoff rights, (l) proxies, powers and trusts, (m) provisions prohibiting, restricting, or requiring consent to assignment or transfer of any right or property, and (n) the severability, if invalid, of provisions to the foregoing effect.
     With your consent, we have assumed (a) that each of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, the Purchase Contracts and the Indenture (collectively, the "") has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the parties thereto other than the Company, (b) that each of the Documents and the Senior Notes constitutes a legally valid and binding obligation of the parties thereto (including, without limitation, the Holders acting through the Purchase Contract Agent) other than the Company, enforceable against each of them in accordance with their respective terms, (c) that the status of each of the Documents and the Senior Notes as a legally valid and binding obligation of the parties will not be affected by any (i) breaches of, or defaults under, agreements or instruments, (ii) violations of statutes, rules, regulations or court or governmental orders, or (iii) failures to obtain required consents, approvals or authorizations from, or to make required registrations, declarations or filings with, governmental authorities, and (d) that any make-whole amount or any premium payable in respect of the Senior Notes would be deemed to be reasonable in the circumstances applicable to the Senior Notes, the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture.
Documents
     This opinion is for your benefit in connection with the Registration Statement and may be relied upon by you and by persons entitled to rely upon it pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Act. We consent to your filing this opinion as an exhibit to the Company's Form 8-K dated November 20, 2007 and to the reference to our firm contained in the Prospectus under the heading "Validity of the securities." In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
