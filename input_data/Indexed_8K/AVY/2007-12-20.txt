     As such counsel, we have examined such matters of fact and questions of law as we have considered appropriate for purposes of this letter. With your consent, we have relied upon certificates and other assurances of officers of the Company and others as to factual matters without having independently verified such factual matters. We are opining herein as to the internal laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and we express no opinion with respect to the applicability thereto, or the effect thereon, of the laws of any other jurisdiction or, in the case of Delaware, any other laws or as to any matters of municipal law or the laws of any local agency within any state.
     Subject to the foregoing and the other matters set forth herein, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof:
     (1) The Purchase Contracts have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company, and when duly executed, authenticated and issued in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, and when delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute legally valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
     (2) The Senior Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company, and when duly executed, authenticated and issued in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture, and when delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute legally valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
     Our opinions are subject to: (i) the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, preference, fraudulent transfer, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors; (ii) the effect of general principles of equity, whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law (including the possible unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief), concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and the discretion of the court before which a proceeding is brought; (iii) the invalidity under certain circumstances under law or court decisions of provisions providing for the indemnification of or contribution to a party with respect to a liability where such indemnification or contribution is contrary to public policy; and (iv) we express no opinion with respect to (a) any provision for liquidated damages, default interest, late charges, monetary penalties or other economic remedies to the extent such provisions are deemed to constitute a penalty, (b) consents to, or restrictions upon, governing law, jurisdiction, venue, arbitration, remedies, or judicial relief, (c) the waiver of rights or defenses contained in Section 7.07 of the Supplemental Indenture and Section 6.06 of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, (d) any provision requiring the payment of attorneys' fees, where such payment is contrary to law or public policy, (e) any provision permitting, upon acceleration of the Senior Notes, collection of that portion of the stated principal amount thereof which might be determined to constitute unearned interest thereon, (f) the creation, validity, attachment, perfection, or priority of any lien or security interest, (g) advance waivers of claims, defenses, rights granted by law, or notice, opportunity for hearing, evidentiary requirements, statutes of limitation, trial by jury or at
