The Company believes that the most significant risk factors that could affect its ability to achieve its stated financial expectations in the near-term include (1) the impact of economic conditions on underlying demand for the Company's products; (2) the degree to which higher raw material and energy-related costs can be passed on to customers through selling price increases, without a significant loss of volume; (3) the impact of competitors' actions, including pricing, expansion in key markets, and product offerings; (4) potential adverse developments in legal proceedings and/or investigations regarding competitive activities, including possible fines, penalties, judgments or settlements; and (5) the ability of the Company to achieve and sustain targeted cost reductions, including expected synergies associated with the Paxar acquisition.
For a more detailed discussion of these and other factors, see Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" and Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" in the Company's Form 10-K, filed on February 28, 2007.

Exhibit 99.1
     PASADENA, Calif.  January 29, 2008  Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE:AVY) today reported net income of $79.4 million or $0.81 per share, compared with $104.7 million or $1.04 per share in the prior year. Results included restructuring and asset impairment charges, transition costs associated with the integration of Paxar, and other items, totaling $0.27 and $0.05 in the fourth quarters of 2007 and 2006, respectively. (
See Attachment A-3: "Preliminary Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures".)
     Net sales from continuing operations for the fourth quarter were $1.71 billion, up approximately 21 percent from $1.41 billion for the same quarter last year. Sales before the impact of the Paxar acquisition and foreign currency translation were down approximately 1 percent from the prior year.
     The Company reported net income of $303.5 million or $3.07 per share for the full year 2007, compared with $373.2 million or $3.72 per share in the prior year. Results included restructuring and asset impairment charges, transition costs associated with the integration of Paxar, and other items, totaling $0.84 per share in 2007 and $0.12 per share in the prior year. Net sales were $6.31 billion in 2007, compared to $5.58 billion in the previous year. (
See Attachment A-3: "Preliminary Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures".)
 
     In the fourth quarter of 2007, Avery Dennison changed from the last-in, first- out (LIFO) inventory accounting method to the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for certain businesses operating in the U.S. All the Company's businesses now utilize the FIFO method of accounting for inventory. All results have been presented on a FIFO basis as if the accounting change occurred as of January 1, 2006.
     "2007 was a challenging year as U.S. retail markets slowed and market conditions for our pressure-sensitive materials business weakened, causing us to miss our revenue growth and profit objectives for the year," said Dean A. Scarborough, president and chief executive officer of Avery Dennison. "We took a number of actions to mitigate the effects of weaker market conditions, including accelerating productivity programs and reducing expenses."
     "I am pleased with the Paxar acquisition, which positions us as the clear leader in the global retail information services market," he added. "The integration of Paxar with our Retail Information Services Group has been virtually seamless to our customers and is on track to realize annual cost synergies of nearly $125 million by the end of 2009."
     "We continue to achieve solid results in the emerging markets, particularly in China and India where we have expanded our capacity with several new manufacturing facilities," Scarborough said. "Our radio frequency identification business is gaining traction with the number of inlays sold in 2007 nearly tripling from the previous year. Buoyed by Paxar's RFID business, we expect sales of RFID products to reach $50 million in 2008."

Outlook for the Year
     Avery Dennison announced that it expects reported (GAAP) earnings for 2008 to be in the range of $3.80 to $4.20 per share, including an estimated $0.35 per share in restructuring and asset impairment charges and Paxar integration costs. These charges and costs are subject to revision, as plans have not been finalized. Excluding these items, the Company expects full year earnings per share for 2008 to be in the range of $4.15 to $4.55 per share. (
See Attachment A-6: "Preliminary Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures (Full Year 2008 Estimates)".)
     The Company's earnings expectations reflect an assumption of reported revenue growth in the range of 9.5 to 12.5 percent, including a 6.5 percent contribution from the Paxar acquisition and an estimated 2 to 3 percent benefit from currency translation.

PRELIMINARY CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME
(In millions, except per share amounts)
2006 amounts have been restated to reflect the change in method of accounting for inventory from last-in, first-out (LIFO) to first-in, first-out (FIFO) for certain businesses operating in the U.S.
 
A-2
Avery Dennison reports financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and herein provides some non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the Company's presentation of its financial results that are prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company's non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain events, activities or strategic decisions. The accounting effects of these events, activities or decisions, which are included in the GAAP measures, may make it difficult to assess the underlying performance of the Company in a single period. By excluding certain accounting effects, both positive and negative (e.g. gains on sales of assets, restructuring charges, asset impairments, effects of acquisitions and related costs, etc.), from certain of the Company's GAAP measures, the Company believes that it is providing meaningful supplemental information to facilitate an understanding of the Company's "core" or "underlying" operating results. These non-GAAP measures are used internally to evaluate trends in the Company's underlying business, as well as to facilitate comparison to the results of competitors for a single period. The Company applies a quarterly tax rate to the accounting adjustments in order for the year-to-date tax rate on non-GAAP income to be consistent with the year-to-date GAAP tax rate.
Limitations associated with the use of the Company's non-GAAP measures include (1) the exclusion of items that recur from time to time (e.g. restructuring, asset impairment charges, discontinued operations, etc.) from calculations of the Company's earnings and operating margin; (2) the exclusion of the effects of acquisitions, including integration costs and certain financing costs; (3) the exclusion of interest expense from the calculation of the Company's operating margin; and (4) the exclusion of any mandatory debt service requirements, as well as the exclusion of other uses of the cash generated by operating activities that do not directly or immediately support the underlying business (such as discretionary debt reductions, dividends, share repurchase, acquisitions, etc.) for calculation of free cash flow. While some of the items the Company excludes from GAAP measures recur, these items tend to be disparate in amount and timing. Based upon feedback from investors and financial analysts, the Company believes that supplemental non-GAAP measures provide information that is useful to the assessment of the Company's performance and operating trends.
The reconciliation set forth below is provided in accordance with Regulations G and S-K and reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
