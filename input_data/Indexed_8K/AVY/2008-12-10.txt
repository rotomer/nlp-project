Exhibit 10.19.6
THIS AGREEMENT, dated * , is made by and between Avery Dennison Corporation, a Delaware corporation, hereinafter referred to as the "Company," and , an employee of Company or a Subsidiary of Company, hereinafter referred to as "Employee."
*
WHEREAS, Company wishes to grant to Employee an Award of restricted stock units ("RSUs") with Dividend Equivalents ("DEs") under the terms of the Employee Stock Option and Incentive Plan, as amended and restated ("Plan); and
WHEREAS, the Compensation and Executive Personnel Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (hereinafter referred to as the "Committee"), appointed to administer the Plan, has determined that it would be to the advantage and best interest of Company and its shareholders to grant the RSUs with DEs (the "RSU Award") provided for herein to Employee as an inducement to remain in the service of Company or its Subsidiaries and as an incentive for increased efforts during such service;
WHEREAS, the Committee has advised the Company of its determination and instructed the undersigned officers to issue said RSU Award, as authorized under the Plan;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, Company and Employee do hereby agree as follows:
ARTICLE I  DEFINITIONS
Terms not defined herein shall have the meaning given in the Plan. Whenever the following terms are used in this Agreement they shall have the meaning specified below unless the context clearly indicates to the contrary.
1.1 Pronouns
The masculine pronoun shall include the feminine and neuter, and the singular and plural, where the context so indicates.
1.2 Dividend Equivalents
Whenever dividends are paid or distributions made with respect to the Common Stock, Employee shall be entitled to dividend equivalents ("Dividend Equivalents") (in an amount equal in value to the amount of the dividend paid or property distributed on a single share of Common Stock multiplied by the number of Restricted Stock Units in Employee's RSU account), which Dividend Equivalents shall be credited as additional Restricted Stock Units (calculated by dividing the Dividend Equivalent by the price of a single share of Company Stock and including any fractional share) to the Employee's RSU account as of the record date for such dividend or distribution.
ARTICLE II  TERMS OF AWARD
In consideration of Employee's agreement to remain in the employment of Company or its Subsidiaries during the Restriction Period (defined below) and for other good and valuable consideration, on the date hereof the Company grants to Employee a RSU Award representing             shares of the Company's Common Stock, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan. Each RSU shall represent one hypothetical share of Common Stock of the Company. The RSU Award granted hereunder shall be held in the books and records of the Company (or its designee) for the Employee's RSU account. The RSU Award shall be subject to the restrictions described herein and shall vest as set forth in this Agreement.
*
2.2 Restriction Period
(a) No portion of the RSU Award granted hereunder may be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered or disposed of by the Employee until the RSU Award becomes vested. The period of time between the date hereof and the date the RSU Award becomes vested is referred to herein as the "Restriction Period." At the time the RSU Award vests, the RSUs and the DEs vest.
(b) After three fiscal years following the date the RSU Award was granted, the RSU Award will vest on the date of the Committee's certification (as described below), provided that the Company's return on total capital ("ROTC") (as reported in the annual report to shareholders or other report) for the most recently completed fiscal year equals or exceeds the sixty-seventh (67%) percentile of the return on total capital for the peer group companies (as listed in the Company's proxy statement) for such third fiscal year (the "performance test"). (For example, the initial performance test for vesting for the RSU Award granted in December 2005 will be based on the return on total capital for 2008.)
To facilitate the peer group performance comparison needed to determine whether the RSU Award vests, the figures for peer group companies return on total capital will be based upon the twelve-month performance for each company in the peer group closest to the Company's fiscal year end, using the most recent publicly available financial information for such companies.
If the Company meets the performance test described above, all prior non-vested RSU Awards eligible for vesting will vest on the date of the Committee's certification that the Company has met the performance test.
If the Company fails to meet the initial performance test described above, all prior non-vested RSU Awards eligible for vesting will be subject to the same performance test following the end of the next two fiscal years. If the Company fails to meet the performance test by the end of the fifth fiscal year following the date of the grant, then the RSU Award will be forfeited.
(c) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, if the Employee's employment with the Company is terminated for Cause or voluntary termination, the balance of the RSU Award, which has not vested by the time of the Employee's Termination of Employment, shall be forfeited by the Employee, and ownership transferred back to the Company.
In the event of a Change of Control or a termination of Employee's employment for Good Reason (as defined in any employment agreement or related agreement with the Company), the restrictions in this Agreement will lapse and be removed, and the RSU Award granted to Employee pursuant to this Agreement will vest as of the date of such Change in Control or termination for Good Reason.
2.5 Death; Disability
If Employee's employment with the Company or its Subsidiaries terminates by reason of Employee's death or Disability (as defined in any employment agreement or related agreement with the Company, or in the absence of such agreement in the Plan) the restrictions imposed upon the RSU Award granted to Employee pursuant to this Agreement will lapse and be removed, and the RSU Award will vest as of the last date of Employee's employment.
2.6 Retirement
RSU Awards, granted to employees participating in the Senior Executive or the Executive Leadership Compensation Plans (annual bonus plans), who (i) retire under the Company's retirement plan, (ii) have worked for the Company for ten (10) or more years, and (iii) have a combination of age and service with the Company of seventy five (75) or more, will vest as of the date of Termination of Employment, provided that the Company has achieved the ROTC performance test (described in Section 2.2 (b)) herein in at least 3 of the last 5 years before the year of retirement.
2.7 Adjustments in RSU Award
In the event that the outstanding shares of the Common Stock are changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares of the Company or other securities of the Company by reason of merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock split-up, stock dividend, or combination of shares, the Committee or the Company shall make an appropriate and equitable adjustment in the number and kind of the RSU Award granted hereunder. Such adjustment shall be made with the intent that after the change or exchange of shares, the Employee's proportionate interest shall be maintained as before the occurrence of such event.
ARTICLE III  ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK; SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS
3.1 Conditions to and Issuance of Common Stock
The shares of Common Stock deliverable for the RSU Award, or any part thereof, may be either previously authorized but unissued shares or issued shares that have then been reacquired by the Company. Such shares shall be fully paid and nonassessable. The Company's obligation to issue or deliver any certificate or certificates for shares of stock shall be subject to satisfaction of all of the following conditions:
(a) The admission of such shares to listing on all stock exchanges on which such class of stock is then listed;
(b) The completion of any registration or other qualification of such shares under any state or federal law, or under rulings or regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other governmental regulatory body which the Committee or the Company shall, in its absolute discretion, deem necessary or advisable;
(c) The obtaining of any approval or other clearance from any state or federal governmental agency which the Committee or the Company shall, in its absolute discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable;
(d) The receipt by the Company of full payment for all related taxes. The Employee shall be liable for any and all taxes, including withholding taxes, arising out of this RSU Award or the vesting of the RSU Award hereunder. The Employee may elect to satisfy such withholding tax obligation by having the Company retain RSUs having a fair market value equal to the Company's minimum withholding obligations.
Subject to Section 4.5 below, the Company shall issue to the Employee the number of shares of Common Stock represented by the number of vested RSU as soon as practical following the vesting of same, but in no event later than two and one-half (2-1/2) months after the calendar year in which the RSU vests, provided, however, that if one or more of the conditions set forth in subsections (a) through (d) of this Section 3.1 have not been satisfied after such two and one-half month period and the Committee or the Company determines that further delay would not result in the RSU's constituting "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Section 409A"), then such distribution may be further delayed until the satisfaction of such condition or conditions, only for so long as such delay continues not to result in the RSU's constituting "nonqualified deferred compensation" in the determination of the Committee or the Company. Such issuance of shares of Common Stock constitutes payment of the vested RSU and shall satisfy the Company's obligations under this Agreement.
3.2 Shareholder Rights
During the Restriction Period, the Employee shall not have the rights of a shareholder with respect to the RSU Award granted hereunder except for the right to Dividend Equivalents on the RSUs, provided, however, that dividends paid, if any, with respect to RSUs that have not vested at the time of the dividend payment, shall be reflected in the books and records of the Company (or its designee), and shall be subject to the same restrictions that apply to the corresponding RSUs.
ARTICLE IV  MISCELLANEOUS
4.1 Agreement Subject to Plan
The Agreement is subject to the terms of the Plan, and in the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the Plan, the Plan shall control.

In order to comply with the requirements of Section 409A, the Committee or the Company may in its sole discretion delay the issuance and delivery of Common Stock to the Employee (as described in Section 3.1 (e) herein), if the Employee is a "key employee" (as defined in Section 409A or in associated regulations), for a period of six (6) months from the date of separation from service (for example, in the event of a termination of employment for Good Reason or Retirement (as defined in the Plan and referred to in Section 2.6 herein)).

Each PU Award represents one hypothetical share of Common Stock of the Company at 100% target performance. The PU Award shall be held on the books and records of the Company (or its designee) for the Employee's PU account but shall not represent an equity interest in the Company until such time as actual shares shall be issued to the Employee. The PU Award shall be earned, vested and paid as set forth in this Agreement.
2.2 Performance Period
(a) No portion of the PU Award may be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered by the Employee until the PU Award is earned and the shares are issued. Employee must be employed by the Company from the date of this Agreement until the date that the PU Award is earned and vested. The "Performance Period" shall be January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010. At the end of the Performance Period, , the specific number shares of Common Stock to be issued to the Employee under the PU Award shall be determined based on the Company's results during the Performance Period, compared against the performance metrics ("Metrics"), approved by the Committee (as modified by any adjustment items approved by the Committee), except as provided in Sections 2.3 through 2.5.

The three Metrics are: sales, cumulative economic value added, and relative total shareholder return.

(c) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, if the Employee's employment with the Company is terminated, the PU Award, which has not been earned by the time of the Employee's Termination of Employment, shall be forfeited by the Employee.
2.3 Change of Control

If Employee's employment with the Company or its Subsidiaries terminates by reason of Employee's death or Disability (as defined in the Employee's employment agreement or related agreement with the Company, or in the absence of such agreement in the Plan) the PU Award will be earned and vested based on a prorated time-based formula starting with the actual month of service completed by the Employee during the Performance Period divided by the total months in the original Performance Period (in this case 36) multiplied by the number of shares in the PU Award assuming 100% target performance.

2.6 Adjustments in PU Award
In the event that the outstanding shares of the Common Stock are changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares of the Company or other securities of the Company by reason of merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock split-up, stock dividend, combination of shares, or other similar restructuring, the Committee or the Company shall make an appropriate and equitable adjustment in the number and kind of shares represented by the PU Award granted hereunder.

The Directors Equity Plan (formerly the 1988 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors), as amended and restated, herein (the "Plan") is effective as of January 1, 2008, and is intended to attract and retain the services of experienced and knowledgeable non-employee directors of Avery Dennison Corporation (the "Company") for the benefit of the Company and its stockholders and to provide additional incentive for such directors to continue to work for the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The individuals eligible to receive Awards (as defined below) under the Plan shall be those individuals who are members of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"), who are not employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (each, a "Director").
As of December 31, 2002, there were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options ("Options") granted under the Plan 265,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company (the "Common Stock"); as of December 31, 2002, there were 65,000 shares available for future Awards under the Plan. As of the Effective Date, as defined in Paragraph 12 below, the aggregate number of shares deliverable pursuant to Awards (as defined in Paragraph 4(a) below) under the Plan shall be increased by 250,000 for a total of 515,000 shares. Shares of Common Stock issued under the Plan may be authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock, previously outstanding shares of Common Stock held as treasury shares, or treasury shares that have been transferred to and held in a grantor trust of the Company. If any Option granted under the Plan shall expire or terminate for any reason without having been exercised in full, the shares subject thereto shall again be available for the purposes of issuance upon the exercise of Options granted under the Plan.
The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation and Executive Personnel Committee ("Committee") (or other committee of the Board as designated by the Board). Subject to the express provisions of the Plan, the Board shall have authority to interpret the Plan, to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to it, to determine the terms and provisions of Awards (which shall comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan) and to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan; such determinations of the matters referred to in this Paragraph 3 shall be conclusive.
(a) The following types of Awards may be made to Directors under the Plan: (i) Options granted automatically pursuant to Paragraph 4(b); and (ii) Stock Units granted upon a Director's election as contemplated by Paragraph 4(c), and (iii) Stock Awards referred to in paragraph 4(d).
(b) During the term of the Plan, at every regular December meeting of the Board (or such other Board meeting when annual grants of options are made to employees) each Director shall automatically be granted an Option for 2,000 shares of Common Stock (subject to adjustment as provided in Paragraph 8). Each individual who is newly elected as a Director shall also be automatically granted an initial Option for 5,000 shares of Common Stock as of the date of his or her election, subject to
adjustment as provided in Paragraph 8. An individual who is a member of the Board and an employee of the Company or one of its subsidiaries and becomes a Director as a result of retiring from such employment while remaining a member of the Board shall not receive an initial Option for 5,000 shares of Common Stock, but, to the extent he or she is otherwise eligible after becoming a Director, shall receive annual Options pursuant to the first sentence of this Paragraph 4(b). Directors who receive Options are sometimes referred to below as "Optionees."
Each Option shall be evidenced by a written Stock Option Agreement ("Agreement"), which shall be executed by the Optionee and an authorized officer of the Company and which shall contain such other terms and conditions as the Board shall determine, consistent with the Plan.
Only non-qualified stock options (options, which do not qualify as "incentive stock options" under Section 422A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")), shall be granted under the Plan and such options shall comply in all respects to the requirements of Code Section 409A.
(c) The Company has established the Non-Employee Director Deferred Equity Compensation Program (the "Deferred Equity Program") under the Plan, pursuant to which Directors are permitted to elect to receive, in lieu of cash meeting and retainer fees, "Stock Units" (each of which represents one hypothetical share of Common Stock). The election to receive Stock Units in lieu of fees shall be made in the calendar year prior to the year in which the associated services or performed, except that the Company may allow a new Director to make an election within the first thirty days after joining the Board to receive Stock Units in lieu of fees for services performed after the date of such election. Stock Units granted pursuant to this Deferred Equity Program shall be paid to the Director in the form of Common Stock within ninety (90) days of the Director's "separation from service" with the Company within the meaning of Code Section 409A. Whenever dividends are paid or distributions made with respect to the Common Stock, the Director shall be entitled to dividend equivalents in an amount equal in value to the amount of the dividend paid or property distributed on a single share of Common Stock multiplied by the number of Stock Units credited to the Director), which dividend equivalents shall be credited as additional Stock Units (calculated by dividing the dividend equivalent by the price of a single share of Company Stock and including any fractional share) to the Director's account as of the last business day of each calendar quarter. All Stock Units granted to any Directors under the Deferred Equity Program at any time on or after the Effective Date, and all such additional shares, shall be settled with shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to this Plan, subject to the limitation set forth in Paragraph 2 but in all events within ninety (90) days after such Directors separation from service subject to compliance with all requirements of Code Section 409A.
(d) The Board or Committee may also approve awards of stock or stock payments ("Stock Awards") to Directors as a portion of the directors' compensation program, the payment of which Stock Awards shall comply with all applicable requirements of Code Section 409A.
(a) The per-share price ("Option Price") to be paid for the Common Stock under each Option shall be 100% of the Fair Market Value of a share of the Common Stock on the date such Option is granted. Options granted may not be repriced. "Fair Market Value" of a share of Common Stock as of a given date shall be (i) the mean between the highest and lowest selling price of a share of Common Stock during normal business hours on the principal exchange on which shares of Common Stock are then trading, if any, on such date, or if shares were not traded on such date, then the weighted average of the means between the highest and lowest sales upon the nearest date before and the nearest date after such valuation date; or (ii) if Common Stock is not traded on an exchange, the mean between the closing representative bid and asked prices for the Common Stock during normal business hours on such date as reported by NASDAQ or, if NASDAQ is not then in existence, by its successor quotation system; or (iii) if Common Stock is not publicly traded, the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock as established by the Board acting in good faith.
(b) Options shall become exercisable in installments of 50% of the number of shares initially granted, commencing on the first anniversary of the grant date, such installments to be cumulative; provided, however, that all Options held by a Director that are not yet exercisable on the date of such director's Retirement (as defined in Paragraph 5(d) below)at or after age seventy-two shall become fully exercisable on that date. In no case may an Option be exercised as to fewer than 100 shares at anyone time (or the remaining shares covered by the Option if fewer than 100 during the term of the Option). The term of each Option shall be ten (10) years from the date of grant thereof, or such shorter period as is prescribed below in this Paragraph 5. Except as provided below in this Paragraph 5, no Option may be exercised at any time when the Optionee is not a member of the Board. In the event that an Option shall be exercised by any person or persons other than the Optionee as permitted by Paragraph 7 below, appropriate proof of the right of such person or persons to exercise the Option shall be provided to the Company.
(c) Any person exercising an Option or portion of an Option shall do so by delivering to the Secretary or his office of all of the following:
(i) A written notice in a form supplied by the Secretary;
(ii) Full payment for the shares with respect to which the Option, or portion thereof, is exercised in whole or in part by (A) cash; (B) certified or bank check or such other instrument as the Company may accept; or (C) delivery (either by surrender of the shares or by attestation) of shares unrestricted Common Stock already owned by the Optionee of the same class as the Common Stock subject to the Stock Option (based on the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date the Stock Option is exercised); provided, however, that such already-owned shares either were acquired by the Optionee in an open-market transaction or have been held by the Optionee for at least six months at the time of exercise; and
(iii) In the event that the Option shall be exercised by any person or persons other than the Optionee, appropriate proof of the right of such person or persons to exercise the Option.
(d) In the event that an Optionee shall cease to be a member of the Board, other than by reason of retirement after age seventy-two (hereinafter "Retirement") or death, he may exercise his Options within three months after such termination, but not after the expiration of the Options, to the extent of the number of shares exercisable by him at the date of termination of his membership on the Board.
(e) In the event that an Optionee shall cease to be a member of the Board because of Retirement, he may exercise his Options within sixty months after Retirement, but not after the expiration of the Options, to the extent of the number of shares exercisable by him at the date of Retirement.
(f) In the event of the death of an Optionee, any of his Options that were outstanding at the time of his death that have not been previously terminated pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 5(d) or 5(e) may be exercised at any time within twelve months of the date of the Optionee's death, but not after the expiration of the Option, to the extent of the number of shares exercisable by the Optionee at the date of his death.

The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan at any time, but no such amendment, suspension or termination shall impair the rights of Directors under Awards previously granted without the Director's consent. In addition, no such amendment shall be made without the approval of the Company's stockholders to the extent such approval is required by applicable law or the rules of any exchange on which the Common Shares are then listed. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the Company may unilaterally amend the Plan or any Award as necessary to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A.

The Plan was approved by the Company's stockholders at the meeting of the stockholders held on April 24, 2003. The Plan, as amended and restated herein, was approved by the Compensation and Executive Personnel Committee of the Board and was ratified by the Board on December 4, 2008.

Whenever the masculine gender is used, it shall include the feminine and neuter, and whenever a singular pronoun is used it shall include the plural, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.
It is presently intended that the Plan constitutes an "unfunded" plan for incentive and deferred compensation. The Board may authorize the creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the obligations created under the Plan to deliver Common Stock or make payments; provided, howeverthat unless the Committee otherwise determines, the existence of such trusts or other arrangements is consistent with the "unfunded" status of the Plan.

In the event of an error in a Distribution, the applicable Participant's Deferral Account shall, immediately upon the discovery of such error, be adjusted to reflect such under or over payment and, if possible, the next Distribution to such Participant shall be adjusted upward or downward to correct such prior error subject to compliance with permissible corrections procedures established under Code Section 409A. If the remaining balance of a Participant's Deferral Account is insufficient to cover an erroneous overpayment to such Participant, the Company may, at its discretion, offset other amounts payable to the Participant from the Company to the extent permitted under all applicable laws, to recoup the amount of such overpayment(s). It is the intent of the Company that the Plan be interpreted and administered to comply in all respects with Code Section 409A. However, Participants and/or their Beneficiaries shall be responsible for any and all taxes resulting from participation in the Plan, and the Company shall have no liability to the Participant or any Beneficiary in the event any taxes or excise taxes may ultimately be determined to be applicable to any deferral, contribution, vesting event or Distribution under the Plan.

For purposes of application of the above change limitations, installment payments from a Deferral Account shall be treated as a single payment. Changes complying with the requirements of this Section 7.1(b) may be made any number of times with respect to the same Deferral Account but in no event may any change delay the distribution of benefits payable from any Deferral Account beyond the date the Participant attains (or a deceased Participant would have attained) age ninety-two (92).

Installment payments shall be based on the Participant's Deferral Account balance at the beginning of the payment period and shall be recalculated annually by dividing the Participant's Deferral Account balance as of the last day of the Plan Year by the number of remaining years in the payment period based on the Participant's retirement payment election. Deferral Accounts shall continue to be credited during the payment period based on the Participant's choice among Declared Rates as provided in Article 6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an installment payout election shall not be available prior to the date that the Participant shall have qualified for Normal Retirement.

The amount distributed pursuant to this Section 7.7 with respect to an Unforeseeable Emergency shall not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy such emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which such hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant's assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship).

If a Participant or Beneficiary, as the case may be, fails to designate a Beneficiary as provided above, or if all designated Beneficiaries predecease the Participant or Beneficiary, as the case may be, or die prior to complete distribution of the Participant's Benefits, then the Administrator shall direct the distribution of such Benefits to the estate of the Participant or Beneficiary, as the case may be.

The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the members of the Committee and the Administrator from and against any and all liabilities, costs, and expenses incurred by such persons as a result of any act, or omission, in connection with the performance of such persons' duties, responsibilities, and obligations under the Plan, other than such liabilities, costs, and expenses as may result from the bad faith, willful misconduct, or criminal acts of such persons.
The Committee at the direction of the Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors of the Company, may amend the Plan; provided, however, that (i) no such amendment shall be effective to decrease the Benefits accrued by any Participant or Beneficiary of a deceased Participant (including, but not limited to, the rate of earnings credited on Deferral Accounts); (ii) no such amendment shall revise the substantive provisions of the Plan related to the calculation of Benefits (including, without limitation, the provisions of Article 6), the minimum number of Declared Rates or the manner or timing of payments to be made under the Plan so as to prejudice the rights of any Participant or Beneficiary, except to the extent required by law, and (iii) no amendment shall change the timing or form of Distributions or otherwise violate the provisions of Code Section 409A so as to result in the imposition of excise taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan shall be interpreted in all respects to comply with the provisions of Code Section 409A and the Committee may amend the Plan at anytime as may be necessary to assure such compliance.
The Company shall not terminate the Plan but may, in its complete and sole discretion, freeze the Plan and allow no further deferrals into this Plan on a prospective basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company or any Participating Subsidiary may accelerate distribution upon termination of the Plan in the event of a Change in Control subject to compliance with all requirements of Code Section 409A.
The Company shall keep, or cause to be kept, all such books of account, records and other data as may be necessary or advisable for the administration of this Plan, and to reflect properly the affairs thereof, and to determine the nature and amount of the interests of the respective Participants in each Deferral Account. Separate accounts or records for the respective Participants' Deferral Accounts shall be maintained for operational and accounting purposes, but no such account or record shall be considered as creating a lien of any nature whatsoever on or as segregating any of the assets with respect to the Deferral Accounts under this Plan from any other funds or property of the Company.
12.1 . Except to the extent preempted by ERISA and applicable substantive provisions of federal law, this Plan shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely therein.
Applicable Law
12.2 . The captions of the articles, sections, and paragraphs of this Plan are for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any of its provisions.
Captions
12.3 . A Participant and the Participant's Beneficiary shall assume all risks in connection with the performance of any Declared Rate and any decrease in value of the Deferral Accounts, and none of the Company, any of its officers, employees, or directors, the Committee or the Administrator shall be liable or responsible therefor.
Limitation
12.4 . Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to the Administrator under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand delivered, or sent by registered or certified mail, to the principal office of the Company, directed to the attention of the Administrator with a copy to the Senior Vice President and General Counsel of the Company. Such notice shall be deemed given as of the date of delivery or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark on the receipt for registration or certification.
Notice
12.5 . Other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution, or legal or judicial process related to dissolution of marriage, no right, title or interest of any kind in the Plan shall be transferable or assignable by a Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary or be subject to alienation, anticipation, encumbrance, garnishment, attachment, levy, execution or other legal or equitable process, nor subject to the debts, contracts, alimony, liabilities or engagements, or torts of any Participant or Participant's Beneficiary. Any attempt to alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, garnish, attach or take any other action subject to legal or equitable process or encumber or dispose of any interest in the Plan shall be void.
Limits on Transfer
12.6 . Payments to any Participant or Beneficiary in accordance with the provisions of the Plan shall, to the extent thereof, be in full or partial satisfaction of claims against the Company for the compensation or other amounts deferred and relating to the Deferral Account to which the payments relate.
Satisfaction of Claims
12.7 . Each Participant shall cooperate with the Company by furnishing any and all information requested by the Company in order to facilitate the payment of Benefits hereunder, taking such physical examinations as the Company may deem necessary and taking such other relevant action as may be requested by the Company. If a Participant refuses to so cooperate, the Company shall have no further obligation to the Participant under the Plan, other than payment to such Participant of the cumulative deferrals theretofore made pursuant to this Plan. If a Participant commits suicide during the two (2) year period beginning on the first day on which he participates in the Plan or if the Participant makes any material misstatement of information or nondisclosure of medical history, then no Benefits will be payable hereunder to such Participant of the deferrals theretofore made pursuant to this Plan, provided, that in the Company's sole discretion, Benefits may be payable in an amount reduced to compensate the Company for any loss, cost, damage or expense suffered or incurred by the Company as a result in any way of any such action, misstatement or nondisclosure.
Participant Cooperation
12.8 . The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan of deferred compensation and Participants shall rely solely on the unsecured promise of the Company for payment hereunder. With respect to any payment not yet made to a Participant under the Plan, nothing contained in the Plan shall give a Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general unsecured creditor of the Company. The Company has established the Avery Dennison Corporation Directors Compensation Trust ("Rabbi Trust"). The assets of the Rabbi Trust shall be subject to the claims of the Company's creditors. To the extent any Benefits provided under the Plan are actually paid to a Participant or Beneficiary from the Rabbi Trust, the Company shall have no further obligation with respect thereto, but to the extent not so paid, such Benefits shall remain the obligation of, and shall be paid by, the Company. Participants and their Beneficiaries, heirs, successors, and assigns shall have no legal or equitable rights, interest, or claims in or to any specific property or assets of the Company, nor shall they be beneficiaries of, or have any rights, claims, or interests in any life insurance policies, annuity contracts, or the proceeds therefrom owned or which may be acquired by the Company ("Policies"). Apart from the Rabbi Trust, such Policies or other assets of the Company shall not be held under any trust for the benefit of Participants, their Beneficiaries, heirs, successors, or assigns, or held in any way as collateral security for the fulfilling of the obligations of the Company under this Plan. Any and all of the Company's assets and Policies shall be, and shall remain, the general, un-pledged, unrestricted assets of the Company. The Company's obligations under the Plan shall be merely an unfunded and unsecured promise of the Company to pay money in the future.
Unfunded Status of Plan; Creation of Rabbi Trust
12.9 . The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law or any usury law or other law that would prohibit or forgive the Company from paying all or any portion of the Benefits due hereunder, wherever such laws may be enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which may affect the administration or performance of this Plan; and (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) the Company hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the realization of any Benefits to which the Participants hereunder are entitled, but will suffer and permit the realization of all such Benefits as though no such law had been enacted. The provisions of this Section 12.9 are not intended, however, to prevent compliance of the Plan with the provisions of Code Section 409A.
Waiver of Stay, Extension and Usury Laws
12.10 . The establishment and maintenance of, or allocations and credits to, the Deferral Account of any Participant shall not vest in any Participant any right, title or interest in and to any Plan assets or Benefits except at the time or times and upon the terms and conditions and to the extent expressly set forth in the Plan and in accordance with the terms of the Rabbi Trust.
Status
12.11 . In the event any provision of this Plan is held invalid, void, or unenforceable, the same shall not affect, in any respect whatsoever, the validity of any other provision of this Plan.
Validity
12.12 . The waiver by any party of any breach of any provision of the Plan by any other party shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.
Waiver of Breach
12.13 . All pronouns and any variations thereof shall be deemed to refer to the masculine, feminine, or neuter, as the identity of the person or persons may require. As the context may require, the singular may be read as the plural and the plural as the singular.

Cashing Out of Stock Option

provided, however,
(c) In the event that the Option shall be exercised by any person or persons other than the Optionee, appropriate proof of the right of such person or persons to exercise the Option.

6.2 Terms and Conditions

To the extent that a Stock Appreciation Right is exercised and settled in Common Stock, the number of shares available for future Awards under the Plan shall be reduced by the number of Stock Appreciation Rights that are exercised (and not the number of shares actually issued upon settlement of the Award).
(c) Stock Appreciation Rights shall be transferable only to permitted transferees of the underlying Option in accordance with the provisions of the Plan.

If the Committee does not designate an Award of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Stock or Performance Units as a Qualified Performance-Based Award, it may also condition the grant or vesting thereof upon the attainment of Performance Goals. Regardless of whether an Award of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Stock or Performance Units is a Qualified Performance-Based Award, the Committee may also condition the grant or vesting thereof upon the continued service of the Awardee. The conditions for grant or vesting and the other provisions of Awards of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Stock or Performance Units (including any applicable Performance Goals) need not be the same with respect to each Awardee. The Committee may at any time, in its sole discretion, accelerate or waive, in whole or in part, any of the foregoing restrictions; provided, however, that in the case of an Award that is a Qualified Performance-Based Award, the applicable Performance Goals have been satisfied.

11.2 Unfunded Status of Plan
It is presently intended that the Plan constitutes an "unfunded" plan for incentive and deferred compensation.

11.3 General Provisions
(a) The Committee or the Company may require each person purchasing or receiving shares of Common Stock pursuant to an Award, as a condition to delivery of such shares, to represent to and agree with the Company in writing that such person is acquiring the shares without a view to the distribution thereof and to provide such other representations and such documents as the Committee or the Company deems necessary or appropriate to effect compliance with all applicable laws. Such shares may be delivered by book entry or in certificate form, with such legends or other notations as the Committee or the Company deems appropriate to reflect any restrictions on transfer.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement, the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any shares of Common Stock under the Plan prior to fulfillment of all of the following conditions:

An Awardee shall not be, nor have any of the rights or privileges of, a stockholder of the Company in respect of any shares of Common Stock that may become deliverable pursuant to an Award unless and until such shares have been delivered to the Awardee.
(c) In the event an Award is granted to an Employee who is employed outside the United States and who is not compensated from a payroll maintained in the United States, the Committee or the Company may modify the provisions of the Plan as they pertain to such Award or Awardee to comply with applicable foreign law, and/or related regulations or requirements.
(d) The Committee or the Company may (but need not) establish rules or terms and conditions in an applicable Award Agreement, under which Awardees may be permitted to elect to defer receipt of cash or shares in settlement of Restricted Stock Units, Performance Stock and Performance Units for a specified period or until a specified event, either under an existing plan of the Company or otherwise.
(e) The Plan, in form and operation, is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code. To the extent that the terms of the Plan are inconsistent with Section 409A, then the terms of the Plan will be automatically deemed to be amended and construed so as to be in compliance. The Committee or the Company may make any amendments to the Plan or to any outstanding Awards in order to comply with the requirements of Section 409A.
11.4 Amendment, Suspension, or Termination of this Plan
The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan at any time prior to a Change of Control, but no such amendment, suspension or termination shall impair the rights of Awardees under Awards previously granted without the Awardee's consent, and provided further that no material amendments will be made to the terms of the Plan without the approval of the Company's stockholders.
The Committee may amend the terms of any Award after it is granted, prospectively or retroactively, but no such amendment shall reprice an option, cause a Qualified Performance-Based Award to cease to qualify for the Section 162(m) Exemption or impair the rights of the Awardee without the Awardee's consent.
Notwithstanding the forgoing, the Committee or the Company may unilaterally amend the Plan or any Award as necessary to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A.
11.5 Adjustments upon Changes in Common Stock
In the event of an equity restructuring involving a nonreciprocal transaction between the Company and its stockholders, such as a stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, share combination, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or shares, separation, spin-off, reorganization, stock rights offering, liquidation, Disaffiliation of a Subsidiary or similar event that affects the number or kind of shares of Common Stock (or other securities of the Company) or the share price of Common Stock (or other securities) and causes a change in the per share value of the Common Stock underlying outstanding Awards, the Committee or the Company shall make appropriate and equitable adjustments to the following:
(b) the number of shares of Common Stock covered by outstanding Awards;
(c) the option price of outstanding Options, and
(d) appropriate and equitable adjustments to other outstanding Awards.

11.6 Approval of Plan by Stockholders
The Plan was approved by the Company's stockholders at the annual meeting of stockholders on April 24, 2008. The Plan, as amended and restated, was approved by the Board on December 4, 2008.
11.7 Tax Withholding
No later than the date as of which an amount first becomes includible in the gross income of an Awardee for federal income tax purposes with respect to any Award under the Plan, such an Awardee shall pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company regarding the payment of, any federal, state, local or foreign taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to such amount. Unless otherwise determined by the Company, withholding obligations may be settled with Common Stock, including Common Stock that is part of the Award that gives rise to the withholding requirement; provided, however, that not more than the legally required minimum withholding may be settled with Common Stock. The obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be conditional on such payment or arrangements, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment otherwise due to such an Awardee. The Committee may establish such procedures as it deems appropriate, including making irrevocable elections, for the settlement of withholding obligations with Common Stock. The Awardee shall be responsible for the payment of all taxes applicable to Awards, vesting, distributions or payments received from the Company. It is the intent of the Company that the provisions of this Plan be interpreted to comply in all respects with Code Section 409A, however, the Company shall have no liability to the Awardee, or any successor or beneficiary thereof, in the event taxes, penalties or excise taxes may ultimately be determined to be applicable to any Award, vesting, distribution or payment received by the Awardee or any successor or beneficiary thereof.
11.8 Beneficiaries
The Committee or the Company shall establish such procedures as it deems appropriate for Awardees to designate one or more persons (each, a "Beneficiary") to whom any amounts payable under this Plan in the event of the applicable Awardee's death are to be paid and/or by whom any rights of the applicable Awardee's, after the Awardee's death, may be exercised. Designation, revocation and redesignation of Beneficiaries must be made in writing in accordance with procedures established by the Committee or the Company, and shall be effective upon delivery to the Committee or the Company.
11.9 Effect of Plan
The adoption of this Plan shall not affect any other compensation or incentive plans in effect for the Company or any Subsidiary. Nothing in this Plan shall be construed to limit the right of the Company (a) to establish any other forms of incentives or compensation for employees of the Company or any Subsidiary, or (b) to grant or assume options or other rights otherwise than under this Plan in connection with any proper corporate purpose, including the grant or assumption of options in connection with the acquisition by purchase, lease, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of the business, stock or assets of any corporation, firm or association. Nothing in this Plan or in any Award Agreement shall confer upon any Awardee any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary or interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Company and the Subsidiaries, which are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge any Awardee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without Cause.

In the event a Participant becomes ineligible to continue participation in the Plan, but has not experienced a Termination of Employment, no further Annual Deferrals or Company Contributions shall be made by or on behalf of the Participant but the Participant's Accounts shall be held and administered in accordance with the Plan until such time as the Participant's Accounts have been completely distributed.
Continuation of Participation
4.1 . On the Participation Election Form, and subject to the restrictions set forth herein, an Eligible Employee shall designate the amount of Annual Base Salary and Bonus to be deferred for the following Plan Year or Bonus performance period, or such other period as the Committee may determine, provided that any deferral election shall be made no later than the last day of the calendar year preceding the calendar year (or, in the case of a new Participant, the thirtieth (30) day following initial eligibility for the remaining portion of the Plan Year) in which the services are performed for which such Annual Base Salary or Bonus are earned; except and provided further that, to the extent allowed by Code Section 409A, the Committee may allow deferral elections to be made or revised no later than six (6) months before the end of the performance period solely with respect to any "performance-based compensation" as defined in Code Section 409A that is based on services performed over a period of at least twelve (12) months. For this purpose, the Committee shall determine, in its complete and sole discretion, whether any Bonus qualifies as "performance-based compensation" as defined under Code Section 409A.
Annual Deferral
th
4.2 . The minimum amount of Annual Deferral that may be deferred shall be two percent (2%) of a Participant's Annual Base Salary.
Minimum Deferral
4.3 . The standard maximum amount of Annual Deferral that may be deferred shall be seventy-five percent (75%) of a Participant's Annual Base Salary and one hundred percent (100%) of a Participant's Bonus; provided that, with the approval of the Administrator, Participants may defer up to one hundred percent (100%) of their Annual Base Salary, less applicable withholdings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may further limit the maximum or the minimum amount of deferrals by any Participant or group of Participants in its sole discretion.
Maximum Deferral
5.1 . The Employer, in its sole discretion, may credit to selected Participants' Accounts a discretionary amount or match of an Annual Deferral in any amount determined by the Company. Matching Contributions shall be made in the complete and sole discretion of the Company and no Participant or Eligible Employee shall have the right to receive any Matching Contribution regardless of whether Matching Contributions are made on behalf of other Participants. Matching Contributions shall vest at the time specified by the Company.
Discretionary Matching Contributions
5.2 . The Employer, in its complete and sole discretion, may credit an amount to the Plan on behalf of an existing Participant or a newly Eligible Employee as a special bonus award or a deferred signing bonus (a "Special Unit Contribution"). Such amounts shall be granted pursuant to a Special Unit Award Agreement which shall specify the period over which such Special Unit Contribution shall vest. The Participant may be granted an election with respect to the time and form of payment of a Special Unit Contribution during the thirty (30) day period following the grant of a Special Unit Contribution if such Contribution is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture for a minimum of twelve (12) months after the end of such election period (i.e., 13 months after the grant date), or as otherwise permitted under Code Section 409A.
Special Unit Contributions
5.3 . A Participant may be credited an amount under the Plan as a hypothetical stock contribution (a "Stock Unit Contribution"), for example, pursuant to a Performance Unit Award under the Company-sponsored Employee Stock Option and Incentive Plan or any successor plan or similar plan, as determined by the Company in its complete and sole discretion, and as evidenced by a Stock Unit Award Agreement. The Stock Unit Award Agreement may specify that such award is to be contributed to this Plan or the Participant may be granted an election with respect to such an award to defer such phantom stock unit award into this Plan within the thirty (30) day period following grant of the award but only if such stock unit award is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture for a minimum of twelve (12) months after the end of such election period (i.e., 13 months after the grant date), or as otherwise permitted under Code Section 409A.
Stock Unit Contributions
6.1 . Solely for record keeping purposes, the Company shall maintain up to five (5) Deferral Accounts under the Plan for each Participant. Annual Deferrals shall be credited by the Employer to the Participant's Deferral Account at the time such amounts would otherwise have been paid to the Participant. The Company shall also maintain a Company Contributions Account for each Participant which shall be credited with any Matching Contributions made on behalf of such Participant pursuant to Section 5.1, as directed by the Company. In addition to Deferral Accounts and Company Contribution Accounts, separate Special Unit Accounts shall be maintained for each Special Unit Contribution and a separate Stock Unit Account shall be maintained for all Stock Unit Contributions made to the Plan on behalf of a Participant, if any, as directed by the Company. All of a Participant's Accounts, except the Stock Unit Account, shall be credited (and compounded daily) with a notional rate of return (positive or negative) based on the Declared Rate(s) elected by the Participant under Section 6.2. Stock Unit Accounts shall be credited as provided in Section 6.4.
Accounts
6.2 . The crediting rate on amounts in a Participant's Account shall be based on the Participant's choice among the investment alternatives made available from time to time by the Committee. The Administrator shall establish a procedure by which a Participant may make an Allocation Election among any combination of Declared Rates in one percent (1%) increments up to one hundred percent (100%) and may change the Declared Rate(s) at least once per week with such change(s) effective as of the first day of the next following week. Such investment elections may apply to future deferrals and/or to the existing Account balances, as indicated by the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have no obligation to set aside or invest funds as directed by the Participant and, if the Company elects to invest funds as directed by the Participant, the Participant shall have no more right to such investments than any other unsecured general creditor of the Company.
Participant Election of Declared Rates
6.3 . A Participant may select from Declared Rates which may from time to time be established under the Plan and the number of which may be expanded by the Committee; it being the intention that at all times Participants will have at least nine (9) core investment fund choices comparable in focus, type and quality to those listed on Exhibit A. The Declared Rates provide a rate of return (positive or negative) that are based on the actual net performance of the Declared Rate(s) selected by the Participant. The Declared Rates credited to Participant Accounts shall be the actual net performance of the Declared Rates, to which will be added a basis point credit, which credit (when added to the actual net performance of the Declared Rates) will together be approximately equivalent on average to crediting the actual gross performance of the Declared Rates less twenty (20) basis points.
Declared Rates
6.4 . A Participant's Stock Unit Account shall be credited with the number of phantom shares of common stock of the Company specified in the Stock Unit Award Agreement. Amounts credited to a Stock Unit Account shall be distributed in kind, subject to compliance with all legal requirements. The Committee shall administer any Stock Unit Account consistent with the intent of the Plan to reflect a hypothetical investment in common stock of the Company and shall have the complete and sole discretion to establish a minimum or maximum share level and/or require the adjustment in number or conversion of notional shares held in a Stock Unit Account to an alternative form of security as appropriate to accomplish the intent of the Plan to treat such notional stock units similarly to actual shares of Company common stock. Prior to distribution, Participants shall have no rights as shareholders with respect to amounts credited to a Stock Unit Account except that Participants shall be entitled to be credited with dividend equivalents on vested awards or otherwise as provided under the terms of the Stock Unit Award Agreement. Such dividend equivalents shall be considered current earnings on the Stock Unit Account and shall be credited in the form of additional share units to the Stock Account based on the value of Company stock as of the date dividends are paid to shareholders of the Company.
Stock Unit Accounts
6.5 . The value of an Account as of any date shall equal the amounts theretofore credited or debited to such Account, plus the deemed earnings or losses of such Account in accordance with this Article 6 through the day immediately preceding such date.
Valuation of Accounts
6.6 . A Participant shall be one hundred percent (100%) vested at all times in amounts credited to the Participant's Deferral Accounts. Amounts credited to a Participant's Company Contributions Account or Special Unit Account shall vest as specified by the Company or in the Special Award Agreement. Amounts credited to a Participant's Stock Unit Account shall vest as provided under the applicable Stock Unit Award Agreement for such Stock Unit Contribution.
Vesting
6.7 . The Administrator (or an agent thereof) shall provide to each Participant periodic statements or on-line access to information setting forth the Participant's deferrals, Declared Rate(s) (credits or debits), Distributions and Account balance.
Statement of Accounts
6.8 . In the event an error is made in a benefit statement, such error shall be corrected on the next benefit statement following the date such error is discovered. In the event of an error in the amount of a Participant's deferral, immediately upon the discovery of such error, if possible, the next deferral of such Participant shall be adjusted upward or downward to correct such prior error subject to compliance with permissible corrections procedures established under Code Section 409A. In the event of an error in a Distribution, the applicable Participant's Account shall, immediately upon the discovery of such error, be adjusted to reflect such under or over payment and, if possible, the next Distribution to such Participant shall be adjusted upward or downward to correct such prior error subject to compliance with permissible corrections procedures established under Code Section 409A. If the remaining balance of a Participant's Account is insufficient to cover an erroneous overpayment to such Participant, the Company may, at its discretion, offset other amounts payable to the Participant from the Company to the extent permitted under all applicable laws, to recoup the amount of such overpayment(s). It is the intent of the Company that the Plan be interpreted and administered to comply in all respects with Code Section 409A. However, Participants and/or their Beneficiaries shall be responsible for any and all taxes resulting from participation in the Plan, and the Company shall have no liability to the Participant or any Beneficiary in the event any taxes or excise taxes may ultimately be determined to be applicable to any deferral, contribution, vesting event or Distribution under the Plan.
Errors in Benefit Statements, Deferrals, Distributions or Administration
7.1 .
Normal Benefit Distribution Election
(a) . At the time of entering the Plan or, if later, on or before December 31, 2008, Participants shall designate the time and form of distributions of amounts credited to their Accounts, from among the distribution alternatives specified herein. A Participant may establish up to five (5) Deferral Accounts with different payout elections. Thereafter, at the time of making an Annual Deferral election under the Plan, the Participant shall designate the time and form of Distribution of deferrals made pursuant to such election by directing such deferrals to one or more existing Accounts or by establishing one or more new Accounts with new payout elections. A Participant shall have no more than five (5) Deferral Accounts in existence at any one time under the Plan. A Participant may elect to make additional deferrals into an existing Account in a subsequent Plan Year but may only make a new distribution election for such Account in accordance with the change in elections provisions specified in Section 7.1(b). If deferrals are directed to an Account which is in payout status, such deferrals shall be paid out over the remaining installment period commencing with the calendar year following the year in which the deferral is credited to the Account. At the time of entering the Plan or, if later, on or before December 31, 2008, Participants shall designate the time and form of distributions of amounts credited to their Company Contributions Accounts. The time and form of payment of a Special Unit Account shall be specified in the Special Unit Award Agreement or elected within the first thirty (30) days following the award of such Special Unit Contribution as provided in Section 5.2. All of a Participant's Stock Unit Accounts shall be paid in a single lump-sum on the Settlement Date next following the Participant's Termination of Employment for any reason unless preceded by a Change in Control as specified in Section 7.6, subject to compliance with all applicable laws.
Initial Election
(b) . A distribution election with respect to an existing Account under the Plan may only be changed under the terms and conditions specified by the Committee in compliance with Code Section 409A. After December 31, 2008, except as expressly provided in this Article 7, no acceleration of a distribution is permitted and a subsequent election that delays payment or changes the form of payment shall be permitted if and only if all of the following requirements are met:
Modification of Election
(i) the new election does not take effect until at least twelve (12) months after the date on which the new election is made;
(ii) in the case of payments made on account of Termination of Employment (other than by reason of death or Disability), Change in Control, or a scheduled date, the new election delays payment for at least five (5) years from the date that payment would otherwise have been made, absent the new election; and
(iii) in the case of payments made according to a scheduled date, the new election is made not less than twelve (12) months before the date on which payment would have been made (or, in the case of installment payments, the first installment payment would have been made) absent the new election.
For purposes of application of the above change limitations, distribution elections shall be made on an Account by Account basis and installment payments from a single Account shall be treated as a single payment. Changes complying with the requirements of this Section 7.1(b) may be made any number of times with respect to the same Account but in no event may any change delay the distribution of benefits payable from any Account beyond the date the Participant attains (or a deceased Participant would have attained) age eighty-five (85). No changes shall be made to the timing or form of distribution of a Stock Unit Account unless specifically approved by the Committee. Election changes made pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) shall be made in accordance with rules established by the Committee, and shall comply with all applicable requirements of Code Section 409A and applicable authorities.
7.2 . The Participant shall be entitled to select the time and form of payment of Distributions from a particular Account from among the following alternatives set forth below. Benefits shall be paid according to the Participant's distribution elections unless such distribution election is superseded by an alternative distribution event such as death, Disability, Unforeseeable Emergency, early Termination of Employment, or Change in Control, as specified in this Article 7. No distribution alternatives shall apply to a Stock Unit Account, which shall be payable only in the form of a single lump-sum on the Settlement Date next following Termination of Employment for any reason unless preceded by Change in Control as specified in Section 7.6.
Benefit Distribution Alternatives
(a) . The available forms of payment from each of the Participants Accounts (other than a Stock Unit Account) shall be as follows:

(ii) . Monthly installments of principal and interest payable over a period of any number of years up to twenty (20), but in no event ending later than the date on which the Participant shall attain age eighty-five (85). Installment payments shall be calculated on an annual basis but paid during the Plan Year at approximately monthly intervals as may be determined by the Committee, provided that such intervals shall not be less frequent than quarterly, except in the final year of payments when only one installment shall be made in January of such final Plan Year. Installment payments shall be based on the Participant's vested Account balance at the beginning of the payment period and shall be recalculated annually by dividing the Participant's vested Account balance as of the last day of the Plan Year by the number of remaining years in the payment period based on the Participant's retirement payment election. Accounts shall continue to be credited during the payment period based on the Participant's choice among Declared Rates as provided in Article 6. In the event that any amounts credited to a Participant's Account vest after the end of the installment period, such amounts shall be paid in a single lump-sum on the Settlement Date next following the Participant's Termination of Employment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an installment payout election shall not be available prior to the date that the Participant shall have completed five (5) Years of Participation.
Installment Payments
(iii) . Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the total balance payable from all of a Participant's Accounts under this Plan (and any other plans aggregated with this Plan for purposes of Code Section 409A) as of the date of the Participant's Termination of Employment is less than the applicable dollar amount under Code Section 402(g)(1)(B) for the calendar year of payment, the Company shall have the discretion to pay all of the Participant's benefits under the Plan in the form of a single lump-sum, subject to compliance with Code Section 409A.
Small Benefit Exception
If no election is made regarding the form of benefits from a particular Account, benefits from that Account shall be paid in a single lump-sum.

(ii) In January of any specified Plan Year (without regard to Termination of Employment, except as provided in Section 7.3); or
(iii) Upon the earlier of January of a specified Plan Year or the Settlement Date next following Termination of Employment.
If a Participant does not elect a commencement date for benefits from a particular Account, benefits from such Account shall commence on the Settlement Date next following the Participant's Termination of Employment.
7.3 . In the event of a Participant's Termination of Employment for any reason other than death, Disability, or prior to completion of five (5) Years of Participation, the Participant shall receive an Early Termination Benefit equal to the outstanding vested balance of each of the Participant's Accounts, credited with notional earnings as provided in Article 6, payable in the form of a single lump-sum distribution on the Settlement Date next following such early Termination of Employment. The Participant shall be entitled to no further Benefits under this Plan.

7.7 . Upon a finding by the Committee that the Participant has suffered a Unforeseeable Emergency, subject to compliance with Code Section 409A, the Administrator may at the request of the Participant, approve cessation of current deferrals or accelerate distribution of benefits under the Plan in the amount reasonably necessary to alleviate such financial hardship. The amount distributed pursuant to this Section 7.7 with respect to an Unforeseeable Emergency shall not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy such emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which such hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant's assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship).
Unforeseeable Emergency
Each Participant and Beneficiary shall have the right, at any time, to designate any person or persons as Beneficiary or Beneficiaries to whom payment under this Plan shall be made in the event of death of the Participant or Beneficiary, as the case may be, prior to complete distribution of the Participant's Benefits due under the Plan. Each Beneficiary designation shall become effective only when filed in writing with the Administrator during the Participant's or Beneficiary's lifetime, as the case may be, on a form prescribed by the Administrator.
The filing of a new Beneficiary designation form by a Participant will cancel and revoke all Beneficiary designations previously filed by such Participant.
If a Participant or Beneficiary, as the case may be, fails to designate a Beneficiary as provided above, or if all designated Beneficiaries predecease the Participant or Beneficiary, as the case may be, or die prior to complete distribution of the Participant's Benefits, then the Administrator shall direct the distribution of such Benefits to the estate of the Participant or Beneficiary, as the case may be.
9.1 . A Committee consisting of three (3) or more members shall be appointed by the Company's Chief Executive Officer to administer the Plan, which shall have the exclusive right and full discretion (i) to appoint agents and service providers to act on its behalf, (ii) to interpret the Plan, (iii) to decide any and all matters arising hereunder (including the right to remedy possible ambiguities, inconsistencies, or admissions), (iv) to make, amend and rescind such rules and procedures as it deems necessary for the proper administration of the Plan and (v) to make all other determinations and resolve all questions of fact necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan, including determinations regarding eligibility for benefits payable under the Plan. All interpretations of the Committee with respect to any matter hereunder shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons affected thereby, subject to the provisions of this Article 9. All decisions of the Committee shall be by vote of at least a majority of its members. Members of the Committee shall be eligible to participate in the Plan while serving as members of the Committee, but a member of the Committee shall not vote or act upon any matter that relates solely to such member's interest in the Plan as a Participant. The current members of the Committee are the Chief Executive Officer; the Chief Financial Officer; the Senior Vice President, Human Resources; the Senior Vice President and General Counsel; the Vice President and Treasurer; the Vice President, Compensation and HRIS; the Vice President, Associate General Counsel and Assistant Secretary; the Vice President, Global Finance; the Manager, Corporate Finance and Investments, and the Director, Financial Reporting at the Company's Miller Corporate Center. The Committee has designated the Vice President, Compensation and HRIS as the Administrator to carry out the day-to-day administration of the Plan. No member of the Committee or any other agent thereof including the Administrator shall be liable for any determination, decision, or action made in good faith with respect to the Plan. The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the members of the Committee and the Administrator from and against any and all liabilities, costs, and expenses incurred by such persons as a result of any act, or omission, in connection with the performance of such persons' duties, responsibilities, and obligations under the Plan, other than such liabilities, costs, and expenses as may result from the bad faith, willful misconduct, or criminal acts of such persons.
Committee
9.2 . Any Participant, former Participant or Beneficiary may file a written claim with the Administrator setting forth the nature of the Benefit claimed, the amount thereof, and the basis for claiming entitlement to such Benefit. The Administrator shall determine the validity of the claim and communicate a decision to the claimant promptly and, in any event, not later than ninety (90) days after the date of the claim. The claim may be deemed by the claimant to have been denied for purposes of further review described below in the event a decision is not furnished to the claimant within such ninety (90) day period. If additional information is necessary to make a determination on a claim, the claimant shall be advised of the need for such additional information within forty-five (45) days after the date of the claim. The claimant shall have up to one hundred and eighty (180) days to supplement the claim information, and the claimant shall be advised of the decision on the claim within forty-five (45) days after the earlier of the date the supplemental information is supplied or the end of the one hundred and eighty (180) day period. Every claim for Benefits that is denied shall be denied by written notice setting forth in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant (i) the specific reason or reasons for the denial, (ii) specific reference to any provisions of the Plan (including any internal rules, guidelines, protocols, criteria, etc.) on which the denial is based, (iii) description of any additional material or information that is necessary to process the claim, and (iv) an explanation of the procedure for further reviewing the denial of the claim and shall include an explanation of the claimant's right to pursue legal action upon an adverse determination on review.
Claims Procedure
9.3 . Within sixty (60) days after the receipt of a denial on a claim, a claimant or his/her authorized representative may file a written request for review of such denial. Such review shall be undertaken by the Committee and shall be a full and fair review. The claimant shall have the right to review all pertinent documents, information and data. The Committee shall issue a decision not later than sixty (60) days after receipt of a request for review from a claimant unless special circumstances, such as the need to hold a hearing, require a longer period of time, in which case a decision shall be rendered as soon as possible but not later than one hundred and twenty (120) days after receipt of the claimant's request for review. The decision on review shall be in writing and shall include specific reasons for the decision written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant with specific reference to any provisions of the Plan on which the decision is based and shall include an explanation of the claimant's right to pursue legal action upon an adverse determination on review.
Review Procedures
The Committee at the direction of the Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors of the Company, may amend the Plan; provided, however, that (i) no such amendment shall be effective to decrease the Benefits accrued by any Participant or Beneficiary of a deceased Participant (including, but not limited to, the rate of earnings credited on Accounts); (ii) no such amendment shall revise the substantive provisions of the Plan related to the calculation of Benefits (including, without limitation, the provisions of Article 6), the minimum number of Declared Rates or the manner or timing of payments to be made under the Plan so as to prejudice the rights of any Participant or Beneficiary, except to the extent required by law, and (iii) no amendment shall change the timing or form of Distributions or otherwise violate the provisions of Code Section 409A so as to result in the imposition of excise taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not terminate the Plan but may, in its complete and sole discretion, freeze the Plan and allow no further deferrals into this Plan on a prospective basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company or any Participating Subsidiary may accelerate distribution upon termination of the Plan in the event of a Change in Control subject to compliance with all requirements of Code Section 409A.
The Company shall keep, or cause to be kept, all such books of account, records and other data as may be necessary or advisable for the administration of this Plan, and to reflect properly the affairs thereof, and to determine the nature and amount of the interests of the respective Participants in each Account. Separate Accounts or records for the respective Participants' Accounts shall be maintained for operational and accounting purposes, but no such Account or record shall be considered as creating a lien of any nature whatsoever on or as segregating any of the assets with respect to the Accounts under this Plan from any other funds or property of the Company.
12.1 . Except to the extent preempted by ERISA and applicable substantive provisions of federal law, this Plan shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely therein.
Applicable Law
12.2 . The Plan is intended to be an unfunded plan maintained primarily to provide deferred compensation benefits for a select group of management or highly compensated employees within the meaning of Section 401 of ERISA, and therefore to be exempt from Parts 2, 3, and 4 of Title I of ERISA.
Exempt ERISA Plan
12.3 . The captions of the articles, sections, and paragraphs of this Plan are for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any of its provisions.
Captions
12.4 . Nothing contained in this Plan nor any action taken hereunder, shall be construed as a contract of employment or as giving any Employee any right to be retained in the employ of the Company.
Employment Not Guaranteed
12.5 . A Participant and the Participant's Beneficiary shall assume all risks in connection with the performance of any Declared Rate and any decrease in value of the Accounts, and none of the Company, any of its officers, employees, or directors, the Committee or the Administrator shall be liable or responsible therefor.
Limitation
12.6 . Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to the Administrator under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand delivered, or sent by registered or certified mail, to the principal office of the Employer, directed to the attention of the Administrator with a copy to the Senior Vice President and General Counsel of the Company. Such notice shall be deemed given as of the date of delivery or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark on the receipt for registration or certification.
Notice
12.7 . Other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution, or legal or judicial process related to dissolution of marriage, no right, title or interest of any kind in the Plan shall be transferable or assignable by a Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary or be subject to alienation, anticipation, encumbrance, garnishment, attachment, levy, execution or other legal or equitable process, nor subject to the debts, contracts, alimony, liabilities or engagements, or torts of any Participant or Participant's Beneficiary. Any attempt to alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, garnish, attach or take any other action subject to legal or equitable process or encumber or dispose of any interest in the Plan shall be void.
Limits on Transfer
12.8 . Payments to any Participant or Beneficiary in accordance with the provisions of the Plan shall, to the extent thereof, be in full or partial satisfaction of the Participant's and/or Beneficiary's claims against the Company for the compensation or other amounts deferred and relating to the Account and/or Benefits to which the payments relate.
Satisfaction of Claims
12.9 . The Participant or Beneficiary shall make appropriate arrangements with the Company for satisfaction of any federal, state or local income tax withholding requirements and Social Security or other employee tax requirements applicable to the crediting and payment of Benefits under the Plan. If no other arrangements are made, the Company shall have the right to deduct from amounts otherwise credited or payable in settlement of an Account any sums that federal, state, local or foreign tax law requires to be withheld with respect to such credit or payment.
Tax Withholding
12.10 . Each Participant shall cooperate with the Employer by furnishing any and all information requested by the Administrator in order to facilitate the payment of Benefits hereunder, taking such physical examinations as the Administrator may deem necessary and taking such other relevant action as may be requested by the Employer. If a Participant refuses to so cooperate, the Employer shall have no further obligation to the Participant under the Plan, other than payment to such Participant of the cumulative deferrals theretofore made pursuant to this Plan. If a Participant commits suicide during the two (2) year period beginning on the first day on which he participates in the Plan or if the Participant makes any material misstatement of information or nondisclosure of medical history, then no Benefits will be payable hereunder to such Participant of the deferrals theretofore made pursuant to this Plan, provided, that in the Committee's sole discretion, Benefits may be payable in an amount reduced to compensate the Employer for any loss, cost, damage or expense suffered or incurred by the Employer as a result in any way of any such action, misstatement or nondisclosure.
Participant Cooperation
12.11 . The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan of deferred compensation and Participants shall rely solely on the unsecured promise of the Company for payment hereunder. With respect to any payment not yet made to a Participant under the Plan, nothing contained in the Plan shall give a Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general unsecured creditor of the Company.

Exhibit 10.8.3.1
This EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT is entered into by and between Avery Dennison Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company") and (the "Executive"), effective as of .
     
     
The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to enter into an Employment Agreement with Executive to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication of the Executive. The Board further believes it is imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change of Control (as defined below) and to encourage the Executive's full attention and dedication to the Company currently and in the event of any threatened or pending Change of Control, and has therefore determined to extend the term of the employment period upon a Change of Control to provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change of Control which are competitive with those of other corporations. Therefore, in order to accomplish these objectives, the Board has caused the Company to enter into this Employment Agreement.
This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the matters specified herein and supersedes all prior oral and written employment agreements, understandings and commitments between the Company and Executive.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or any of the provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, if a Change of Control (as defined in Section 2) occurs, the Employment Period shall be automatically extended so as to terminate on the earlier of three years from the date on which the Change of Control occurs or the Executive's Normal Retirement Age.
If the Executive's employment with the Company is terminated prior to the date on which a Change of Control occurs, and if it is reasonably demonstrated by the Executive that such termination of employment (i) was at the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change of Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or anticipation of a Change of Control, then for all purposes of this Agreement the "Employment Period" for such Executive shall be the earlier of three years from the date of such termination of employment or the Executive's Normal Retirement Age.

Terms of Employment
(a) 
Position and Duties
(i) During the Employment Period, the Executive's position (including titles), authority, duties and responsibilities shall be at least commensurate with the most significant of those held, exercised and assigned to the Executive at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Effective Date.

It is expressly understood and agreed that to the extent that any such activities have been conducted by the Executive prior to the Effective Date, the continued conduct of such activities (or the conduct of activities similar in nature and scope thereto) subsequent to the Effective Date shall not thereafter be deemed to interfere with the performance of the Executive's responsibilities to the Company.
(b) 
Compensation
(i)
Base Salary
During the Employment Period, the Executive shall receive an annual base salary ("Annual Base Salary") which shall be paid at a monthly rate at least equal to twelve times the highest monthly base salary paid or payable, including any base salary which has been earned but deferred, to the Executive by the Company and its affiliated companies in respect of the twelve-month period immediately preceding the month in which the Effective Date occurs. During the Employment Period, the Annual Base Salary shall be reviewed no more than 12 months after the last salary increase awarded to the Executive prior to the Effective Date and thereafter at least annually.

5. 
Termination of Employment
(a) 
Death or Disability
The Executive's employment shall terminate automatically upon the Executive's death during the Employment Period. If the Company determines in good faith that the Disability of the Executive has occurred during the Employment Period (pursuant to the definition of Disability set forth below), it may give to the Executive written notice in accordance with Section 12(b) of this Agreement of its intention to terminate the Executive's employment. In such event, the Executive's employment with the Company shall terminate effective on the 30th day after receipt of such notice by the Executive (the "Disability Effective Date"), provided that, within the 30 days after such receipt, the Executive shall not have returned to full-time performance of the Executive's duties with or without reasonable accommodation. For purposes of this Agreement, "Disability" shall mean the absence of the Executive from the Executive's duties with the Company on a full-time basis for a period of (i) ninety (90) consecutive calendar days or (ii) an aggregate of one hundred fifty (150) calendar days in any fiscal year of the Company as a result of incapacity due to mental or physical illness which is determined to be total and permanent by a physician selected by the Company or its insurers and acceptable to the Executive or the Executive's legal representative (subject to compliance with all applicable laws).
(b) 
Cause
The Company may terminate the Executive's employment during the Employment Period for Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean:
(i) the willful and continued failure of the Executive to perform substantially the Executive's duties with the Company or one of its affiliates (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Executive by the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board or Chief Executive Officer believes that the Executive has not substantially performed the Executive's duties, or
(ii) the willful engaging by the Executive in illegal conduct or gross misconduct which is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company.
For purposes of this provision, no act or failure to act, on the part of the Executive, shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the Executive's action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or a senior officer of the Company or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company. The cessation of employment of the Executive shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a notice that the Executive is guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
(c) 
Good Reason
The Executive's employment may be terminated by the Executive during the Employment Period for Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean a "separation from service for good reason" as set forth in Code Section 409A, which shall mean that, without the express written consent of the Executive, one or more of the following shall have occurred without being timely remedied in the manner set forth below:
(i) A material diminution in the Executive's base compensation (except as provided for herein).
(ii) A material diminution in the Executive's authority, duties, or responsibilities.
(iii) A material diminution in the authority, duties, or responsibilities of the supervisor to whom the Executive is required to report.
(iv) A material change in the geographic location at which the Executive must perform the services.
(v) Any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company of the agreement under which the Executive provides services.
The Executive shall have "Good Reason" in connection with any or all of the above solely if (A) the Executive provides notice to the Company of the existence of the particular condition, action or inaction which the Executive considers to give the Executive "Good Reason" within ninety (90) days of the initial existence of the condition, or the action or inaction, and (B) the Company shall not have remedied the condition, action or inaction within thirty (30) days of its receipt of the Executive's notice. The effective date of any termination for "Good Reason" shall be no later than twelve (12) months after the initial existence of such condition, action or inaction constituting "Good Reason."
(d) 
Notice of Termination
Any termination during the Employment Period by the Company for Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto given in accordance with Section 12(b) of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" means a written notice which (i) indicates the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) to the extent applicable, sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated, and (iii) if the Date of Termination (as defined below) is other than the date of receipt of such notice, specifies the termination date (which date shall be not more than thirty days after the giving of such notice). The failure by the Executive or the Company to set forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which contributes to a showing of Good Reason or Cause shall not waive any right of the Executive or the Company, respectively, hereunder or preclude the Executive or the Company, respectively, from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing the Executive's or the Company's rights hereunder.
(e) 
Date of Termination
"Date of Termination" means "termination of service" as such term is defined under Code Section 409A and shall be (i) if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, the effective date of termination specified in the Notice of Termination, (ii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company other than for Cause or Disability, the date on which the Company notifies the Executive of such termination, and (iii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of death or Disability, the date of death of the Executive or the Disability Effective Date, as the case may be.
6.

(ii) for one year (or three years if the Date of Termination occurs after a Change of Control or the Executive's Employment Period is extended to three years under the last paragraph of Section 1(b)) after the Executive's Date of Termination, or such longer period as may be provided by the terms of the appropriate plan, program, practice or policy, subject to compliance with Code Section 409A as provided in Section 12, the Company shall continue benefits to the Executive and/or the Executive's family at least equal to those which would have been provided to them in accordance with the plans, programs, practices and policies described in Section 4(b)(iv) of this Agreement if the Executive's employment had not been terminated or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies and their families; provided, however, that if the Executive becomes reemployed with another employer and is eligible to receive medical or other welfare benefits under another employer-provided plan, the medical and other welfare benefits described herein shall be secondary to those provided under such other plan during such applicable period of eligibility, and for purposes of determining eligibility (but not the time of commencement of benefits) of the Executive for retiree benefits pursuant to such plans, programs, practices and policies, the Executive shall be considered to have remained employed until one year (or three years if the Date of Termination occurs after a Change of Control or the Executive's Employment Period is extended to three years under the last paragraph of Section 1(b)) after the Date of Termination and to have retired on the last day of such period;
(iii) if the Date of Termination occurs after a Change of Control or the Executive's Employment Period is extended to three years under the last paragraph of Section 1(b), the Company shall, at its sole expense as incurred (but in no event to exceed $50,000), provide the Executive with outplacement services the scope and provider of which shall be selected by the Executive in the Executive's sole discretion and any payments shall be subject to compliance with Section 12;
(iv) within two and one-half (2) months after the Date of Termination, the Executive shall be entitled to purchase at depreciated book value the automobile (if any) which the Company was providing for the use of such Executive, and to the extent not theretofore paid or provided, the Company shall timely pay or provide to the Executive any other amounts or benefits required to be paid or provided or which the Executive is eligible to receive under any plan, program, practice or policy or contract or agreement of the Company and its affiliated companies (such other amounts and benefits shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Other Benefits"); and
1/2
(v) the Executive shall be treated, for purposes of the Company's Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, Executive Variable Deferred Compensation Plan, Executive Deferred Retirement Plan, Executive Variable Deferred Retirement Plan, and any successor or similar plans, as if he had one more year of service, and attained an age one year older, than his actual years of service and age as of the Date of Termination; provided, however, that Executive shall be credited with the number of years of service and attained age (in addition to his actual years of service and attained age on the Date of Termination) which are required in order to satisfy the eligibility requirements for "early retirement" benefits and to receive the retirement interest rate under such plans, if the Date of Termination occurs after a Change of Control or the Executive's Employment Period is extended to three years under the last paragraph of Section 1(b).
If the Executive should die while receiving payments pursuant to this Section 6(a), the remaining payments which would have been made to the Executive if he had lived shall be paid to the beneficiary designated in writing by the Executive; or if there is no effective written designation, then to his spouse; or if there is neither an effective written designation nor a surviving spouse, then to his estate. Designation of a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive the balance of any such payments shall be made by written notice to the Company, and the Executive may revoke or change any such designation of beneficiary at any time by a later written notice to the Company.
(b) 
Death
If the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of the Executive's death during the Employment Period, this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive's legal representatives under this Agreement, other than for payment of Accrued Obligations and the timely payment or provision of Other Benefits.

If the Executive's employment shall be terminated for Cause during the Employment Period, this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive other than the obligation to pay to the Executive (x) the Annual Base Salary through the Date of Termination, (y) the amount of any compensation previously deferred by the Executive, and (z) Other Benefits, in each case to the extent theretofore unpaid. If the Executive voluntarily terminates employment during the Employment Period, excluding a termination for Good Reason, or retires at age 65 or thereafter, this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive, other than for Accrued Obligations and the timely payment or provision of Other Benefits. In such case, all Accrued obligations shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Date of Termination.
7. 
Non-exclusivity of Rights
Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive's continuing or future participation in any plan, program, policy or practice provided by the Company or any of its affiliated companies and for which the Executive may qualify, nor shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as the Executive may have under any contract or agreement with the Company or any of its affiliated companies. Amounts which are vested benefits or which the Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any plan, policy, practice or program of or any contract or agreement (other than this Agreement) with the Company or any of its affiliated companies at or subsequent to the Date of Termination shall be payable in accordance with such plan, policy, practice or program or contract or agreement except as explicitly modified by this Agreement.
8. 
Full Settlement; Offsets
Except as provided in this Section 8, the Company's obligation to make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which the Company may have against the Executive or others.
Executive shall not be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement. However, the amount of any payments and benefits provided for in this Agreement shall be reduced by one hundred percent (100%) of any benefits and earned income (within the meaning of Section 911(d)(2)(A) of the Code) which is earned by the Executive for services rendered to persons or entities other than the Company or its affiliates during or with respect to the Employment Period or, after a Change of Control, during the 36-month period after the Date of Termination. Medical and welfare benefits shall be offset as provided in Section 6(a)(ii).
Not less frequently than annually (by December 31 of each year), the Executive shall account to the Company with respect to all benefits and earned income earned by the Executive which are required hereunder to be offset against payments or benefits received by the Executive from the Company. If the Company has paid amounts in excess of those to which the Executive is entitled (after giving effect to the offsets provided above), the Executive shall reimburse the Company for such excess by December 31 of such year. The requirements imposed under this paragraph shall terminate on December 31 of the calendar year in which the Employment Period ends or, after a Change of Control, December 31 of the calendar year which includes the third anniversary of the Date of Termination.
9. 
Certain Additional Payments by the Company
(a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments required under this Section 9) (a "Payment") would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.
(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 9(c), all determinations required to be made under this Section 9, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by the certified public accounting firm which serves as the Company's auditor immediately prior to the Change of Control (the "Accounting Firm"), which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company or the Executive. In the event that such Accounting Firm declines to act, the Company shall appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm (which is acceptable to the Executive) to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Section 9, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination and, in all events, by the end of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which the Executive pays the Excise Tax. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been made ("Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 9(c) and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive and in all events, by the end of the calendar year next following the year in which the Executive pays the Excise Tax..
(c) The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable but no later than fifteen days after the Executive is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which it gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall:
(i) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to such claim,
(ii) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,
(iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim, and
(iv) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim;
provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and shall defend, indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 9(c), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole option, either direct the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that if the Company directs the Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive, on an interest-free basis (subject to compliance with all applicable laws) and shall defend, indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance; and further provided that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder, and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.
(d) If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 9(c), the Executive becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Company's complying with the requirements of Section 9(c)) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 9(c), a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of 30 days after such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.
10. 
Confidential Information
The Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company all secret or confidential business information, knowledge or data relating to the Company or any of its affiliated companies, and their respective businesses, which shall have been obtained by the Executive during the Executive's employment by the Company or any of its affiliated companies and which shall not be or become public knowledge (other than by acts by the Executive or representatives of the Executive in violation of this Agreement). After termination of the Executive's employment with the Company, the Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate or divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the Company and those designated by it. In no event shall an asserted or alleged violation of the provisions of this Section 10 constitute a basis for deferring or withholding any amounts otherwise payable to the Executive under this Agreement.
11. 
Successors
(a) This Agreement is personal to the Executive and without the prior written consent of the Company shall not be assignable by the Executive otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's legal representatives.
(b) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns.
(c) The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to assume expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law or otherwise.
12. 
Compliance with Code Section 409A
(a) All payments of "nonqualified deferred compensation" (within the meaning of Code Section 409A) are intended to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A, and shall be interpreted in accordance therewith. Neither party individually or in combination may accelerate any such deferred payment, except in compliance with Code Section 409A, and no amount shall be paid prior to the earliest date on which it is permitted to be paid under Code Section 409A. In the event that the Executive is determined to be a "key employee" (as defined and determined under Code Section 409A) of Company at a time when its stock is deemed to be publicly traded on an established securities market, payments determined to be "nonqualified deferred compensation" payable following termination of employment or Change in Control, to the extent required under Code Section 409A, shall be made no earlier than the earlier of (i) the last day of the sixth (6th) complete calendar month following such termination of employment, or (ii) the Executive's death. Any payment delayed by reason of the prior sentence shall bepaid out in a single lump sum on the first day of the month following the end of such required delay period in order to catch up to the original payment schedule. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no amendment may be made to this Agreement if it would cause the Agreement or any payment hereunder not to be in compliance with Code Section 409A.
Unless otherwise expressly provided, any payment of compensation by Company to the Executive, whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, shall be made within two and one-half months (2 months) after the end of the later of the calendar year or the Company's fiscal year in which the Executive's right to such payment vests (i.e., is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture for purposes of Code Section 409A). Such amounts shall not be subject to the requirements of subsection (a) above applicable to "nonqualified deferred compensation."
(b)
1/2
Section (a) above shall not apply to that portion of any amounts payable upon termination of employment which shall qualify as "involuntary severance" under Section 409A because such amount does not exceed the lesser of (1) two hundred percent (200%) of the Executive's annualized compensation from the Company for the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year during which the Date of Termination occurs, or (2) two hundred percent (200%) of the annual limitation amount under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code (the maximum amount of compensation that may be taken into account for purposes of a tax-qualified retirement plan) for the calendar year during which the Date of Termination occurs.
(c)
All benefit plans, programs and policies sponsored by the Company shall comply with all requirements of Code Section 409A or be structured so as to be exempt from the application of Code Section 409A. In particular, all taxable expense reimbursement payments and in kind benefits provided to the Executive shall be structured in compliance with Code Section 409A and reimbursements shall be paid by the Company to the Executive by no later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Executive incurs such expenses, and the Executive shall take all actions necessary to claim all such reimbursements on a timely basis to permit the Company to make all such reimbursement payments prior to the end of said period.
(d)
(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that any payment or benefit constitutes non-exempt "nonqualified deferred compensation" for purposes of Section 409A, and such payment or benefit would otherwise be payable or distributable hereunder by reason of Employee's termination of employment, all references to Employee's termination of employment shall be construed to mean a "separation from service," as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h), and Employee shall not be considered to have a termination of employment unless such termination constitutes a "separation from service" with respect to Employee.
13. 
Miscellaneous
(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without reference to principles of conflict of laws. The captions of this Agreement are not part of the provisions hereof and shall have no force or effect. This Agreement may not be amended or modified otherwise than by a written agreement executed by the parties hereto or their respective successors and legal representatives subject to compliance with Section 12.
(b) All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given by hand delivery to the other party or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:
or to such other address as either party shall have furnished to the other in writing in accordance herewith. Notice and communications shall be effective when actually received by the addressee.
(c) The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement.
(d) The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such Federal, state, local or foreign taxes as shall be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.
(e) The Executive's or the Company's failure to insist upon strict compliance with any provision hereof or any other provision of this Agreement or the failure to assert any right the Executive or the Company may have hereunder, including, without limitation, the right of the Executive to terminate employment for Good Reason pursuant to Section 5(c)(i)-(iv) of this Agreement, shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such provision or right or any other provision or right of this Agreement.
14. Arbitration; Attorneys Fees
(a) The parties agree that any disputes, controversies or claims which arise out of or are related to this Agreement, Executive's employment or the termination of his employment, including, but not limited to, any claim relating to the purported validity, interpretation, enforceability or breach of this Agreement, and/or any other claim or controversy arising out of the relationship between the Executive and Company (or the nature of the relationship) or the continuation or termination of that relationship, including, but not limited to, claims that a termination was for Cause or for Good Reason, claims for breach of covenant, breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, wrongful termination, breach of contract, or intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation, breach of right of privacy, interference with advantageous or contractual relations, fraud, conspiracy or other tort or property claims of any kind, which are not settled by agreement between the parties, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the then-current Rules of Practice and Procedure for Employment Arbitration ("Rules") of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. ("JAMS").
The arbitration shall be before a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the JAMS Rules or otherwise by mutual agreement of the parties. The arbitration shall take place in Los Angeles County, California, unless the parties agree to hold the arbitration at another location. Depositions and other discovery shall be allowed in accordance with the JAMS Rules. The arbitrator shall apply the substantive law (and the law of remedies, if applicable) of the State of California or federal law, or both, as applicable to the claim(s) asserted.
(b) In consideration of the parties' agreement to submit to arbitration all disputes with regard to this Agreement and/or with regard to any alleged contract, or any other claim arising out of their conduct, the relationship existing hereunder or the continuation or termination of that relationship, and in further consideration of the anticipated expedition and the minimizing of expense of this arbitration remedy, the arbitration provisions of this Agreement shall provide the exclusive remedy, and each party expressly waives any right he or it may have to seek redress in any other forum. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration shall be final and binding upon the parties.
Either party may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration under this Agreement and to enforce an arbitration award. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, both the Company and the Executive agree that neither of them shall initiate or prosecute any lawsuit or administrative action in any way related to any claim covered by this Agreement.
(c) Any claim which either party has against the other party that could be submitted for resolution pursuant to this Section must be presented in writing by the claiming party to the other party within one year of the date the claiming party knew or should have known of the facts giving rise to the claim, except that claims arising out of or related to the termination of the Executive's employment must be presented by him within one year of the Date of Termination. Unless the party against whom any claim is asserted waives the time limits set forth above, any claim not brought within the time periods specified shall be waived and forever barred, even if there is a federal or state statute of limitations which would have given more time to pursue the claim.
(d) The Company shall advance the costs and expenses of the arbitrator. In any arbitration to enforce any of the provisions or rights under this Agreement, the unsuccessful party in such arbitration, as determined by the arbitrator, shall pay to the successful party or parties all costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred therein by such party or parties (including without limitation such costs, expenses and fees on any appeals), and if such successful party or parties shall recover an award in any such arbitration proceeding, such costs, expenses and attorneys' fees shall be included as part of such award. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, in no event shall the successful party or parties be entitled to recover an amount from the unsuccessful party for costs, expenses and attorneys' fees that exceeds the unsuccessful party's costs, expenses and attorneys' fees in connection with the action or proceeding.
(e) Any decision and award or order of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto and judgment thereon may be entered in the Superior Court of the State of California or any other court having jurisdiction.
(f) Each of the above terms and conditions shall have separate validity, and the invalidity of any part thereof shall not affect the remaining parts.
(g) Any decision and award or order of the arbitrator shall be final and binding between the parties as to all claims which were or could have been raised in connection with the dispute to the full extent permitted by law. In all other cases the parties agree that the decision of the arbitrator shall be a condition precedent to the institution or maintenance of any legal, equitable, administrative, or other formal proceeding by the employee in connection with the dispute, and that the decision and opinion of the arbitrator may be presented in any other forum on the merits of the dispute.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Executive has executed this Agreement and, pursuant to the authorization from the Compensation and Executive Personnel Committee of the Board of Directors, the Company has caused this Agreement to be executed, all as of the day and year first above written.
This EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT is entered into by and between Avery Dennison Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company") and (the "Executive"), effective as of .
     
     
The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to enter into an Employment Agreement with Executive to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication of the Executive. The Board further believes it is imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change of Control (as defined below) and to encourage the Executive's full attention and dedication to the Company currently and in the event of any threatened or pending Change of Control, and has therefore determined to extend the term of the employment period upon a Change of Control to provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change of Control which are competitive with those of other corporations. Therefore, in order to accomplish these objectives, the Board has caused the Company to enter into this Employment Agreement.
This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the matters specified herein and supersedes all prior oral and written employment agreements, understandings and commitments between the Company and Executive.
NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED AS FOLLOWS:
1. Certain Definitions
(a) The "Effective Date" shall mean the date hereof, which is set forth in the first paragraph of this Agreement.
(b) The "Employment Period" shall mean the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Date; provided, however, that commencing on the first day of the month next following the Effective Date and on the first day of each month thereafter prior to a Change of Control (the most recent of such dates is hereinafter referred to as the "Renewal Date"), the Employment Period shall be automatically extended so as to terminate on the earlier of the first anniversary of such Renewal Date or (ii) the Executive's "Normal Retirement Age" as such concept is defined under the Company sponsored qualified retirement plan, unless the Company or Executive shall give notice to the other that the Employment Period shall not be further extended prior to any such Renewal Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any of the provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, if a Change of Control (as defined in Section 2) occurs, the Employment Period shall be automatically extended so as to terminate on the earlier of three years from the date on which the Change of Control occurs or the Executive's Normal Retirement Age.
If the Executive's employment with the Company is terminated prior to the date on which a Change of Control occurs, and if it is reasonably demonstrated by the Executive that such termination of employment (i) was at the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change of Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or anticipation of a Change of Control, then for all purposes of this Agreement the "Employment Period" for such Executive shall be the earlier of three years from the date of such termination of employment or the Executive's Normal Retirement Age.
2 Change of Control
. "Change of Control" means "a change in the ownership or effective control," or in "the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of" the Company, within the meaning of Code Section 409A, and shall include any of the following events as such concepts are interpreted under Code Section 409A:
Change of Control
(i) the date on which a majority of members of the Company's Board of Directors is replaced during any twelve-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Company's Board of Directors before the date of the appointment or election; or
(ii) the acquisition, by any one person, or by a corporation owned by a group of persons that has entered into a merger, acquisition, consolidation, purchase, stock acquisition, asset acquisition, or similar business transaction with the Company, of:
A. ownership of stock of the Company, that, together with any stock previously held by such person or group, constitutes more than fifty percent (50%) of either (i) the total fair market value or (ii) the total voting power of the stock of the Company;
B. ownership of stock of the Company possessing percent (30%) or more of the total voting power of the Company, during the twelve-month period ending on the date of such acquisition; or
C. assets from the Company that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than forty percent (40%) of the total gross fair market value of all of the assets of the Company during the twelve-month period ending on the date of such acquisition; provided, however, that any transfer of assets to a related person as defined under Section 409A shall not constitute a Change of Control.
3. Employment Period
The Company hereby agrees to continue the Executive in its employ, and the Executive hereby agrees to remain in the employ of the Company subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, for the period commencing on the "Effective Date" and continuing during the "Employment Period," as defined in Sections 1(a) and (b) above.
4. Terms of Employment
(a) 
Position and Duties
(i) During the Employment Period, the Executive's position (including titles), authority, duties and responsibilities shall be at least commensurate with the most significant of those held, exercised and assigned to the Executive at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Effective Date.
(ii) During the Employment Period, and excluding any periods of vacation and sick leave to which the Executive is entitled, the Executive agrees to devote reasonable attention and time during normal business hours to the business and affairs of the Company and, to the extent necessary to discharge the responsibilities assigned to the Executive hereunder, to use the Executive's reasonable best efforts to perform faithfully and efficiently such responsibilities. During the Employment Period it shall not be a violation of this Agreement for the Executive to (A) serve on corporate, civic or charitable boards or committees, (B) deliver lectures, fulfill speaking engagements or teach at educational institutions and (C) manage personal investments, so long as such activities do not interfere with the performance of the Executive's responsibilities as an employee of the Company in accordance with this Agreement. It is expressly understood and agreed that to the extent that any such activities have been conducted by the Executive prior to the Effective Date, the continued conduct of such activities (or the conduct of activities similar in nature and scope thereto) subsequent to the Effective Date shall not thereafter be deemed to interfere with the performance of the Executive's responsibilities to the Company.
(b) 
Compensation
(i)
Base Salary
During the Employment Period, the Executive shall receive an annual base salary ("Annual Base Salary") which shall be paid at a monthly rate at least equal to twelve times the highest monthly base salary paid or payable, including any base salary which has been earned but deferred, to the Executive by the Company and its affiliated companies in respect of the twelve-month period immediately preceding the month in which the Effective Date occurs. During the Employment Period, the Annual Base Salary shall be reviewed no more than 12 months after the last salary increase awarded to the Executive prior to the Effective Date and thereafter at least annually. Any increase in Annual Base Salary shall not serve to limit or reduce any other obligation to the Executive under this Agreement. Annual Base Salary shall not be reduced after any such increase, and the term "Annual Base Salary" as utilized in this Agreement shall refer to Annual Base Salary as so increased; provided, however, that Executive's Annual Base Salary may be reduced prior to a Change of Control as part of any general, across the board salary reduction which applies in a comparable manner to other officers or senior executives of the Company, but not by more than ten percent (10%) (unless Executive agrees to accept a larger reduction) during any calendar year. As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliated companies" shall include any company controlled by, controlling or under common control with the Company.

Annual Bonus
In addition to Annual Base Salary, the Executive shall be eligible to receive, for each fiscal year ending during the Employment Period, an annual bonus (the "Annual Bonus") under the Company's Executive Leadership Compensation Plan or Senior Executive Incentive (Leadership) Compensation Plan, or any comparable bonus under any successor plan (such plans, collectively, the "Annual Bonus Plans"), including any Annual Bonus which has been earned but deferred. After a Change of Control, the Executive shall be awarded for each fiscal year ending during the Employment Period an Annual Bonus in cash at least equal to the Executive's average Annual Bonus for the last three full fiscal years prior to the Change of Control (annualized in the event that the Executive was not employed by the Company for the whole of such fiscal year) (the "Recent Annual Bonus"). Each such Annual Bonus shall be paid no later than twp and one-half (2) months after the end of the fiscal year next following the fiscal year for which the Annual Bonus is awarded, unless the Executive shall make a timely election to defer the receipt of such Annual Bonus pursuant to a Company sponsored deferred compensation plan.

In no event shall such plans, practices, policies and programs provide the Executive after a Change of Control with incentive opportunities (measured with respect to both regular and special incentive opportunities, to the extent, if any, that such distinction is applicable), savings opportunities and retirement benefit opportunities, in each case, which are less favorable, in the aggregate, than the most favorable of those provided by the Company and its affiliated companies for the Executive under such plans, practices, policies and programs as in effect at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Change of Control or, if more favorable to the Executive, those provided generally at any time after the Change of Control to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies.

During the Employment Period, the Executive and/or the Executive's family, as the case may be, shall be eligible for participation in and shall receive all benefits under welfare benefit plans, practices, policies and programs provided by the Company and its affiliated companies (including, without limitation, medical, prescription, dental, disability, salary continuance, employee life, group life, accidental death and travel accident insurance plans and programs) to the extent applicable generally to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies. In no event shall such plans, practices, policies and programs provide the Executive after a Change of Control with benefits which are less favorable, in the aggregate, than the most favorable of such plans, practices, policies and programs in effect for the Executive at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Change of Control or, if more favorable to the Executive, those provided generally at any time after the Change of Control to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies.
(v)
Expenses
During the Employment Period, the Executive shall be entitled to receive prompt reimbursement for all reasonable expenses incurred by the Executive in accordance with the policies, practices and procedures of the Company and its affiliated companies in effect for the Executive from time to time. After a Change of Control, such reimbursement shall be made in accordance with the most favorable policies, practices and procedures of the Company and its affiliated companies in effect for the Executive at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Change of Control or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies.
(vi)

During the Employment Period, the Executive shall be entitled to fringe benefits, including, without limitation, if applicable, tax and financial planning services, payment of club dues, and automobile lease and payment of related expenses, in accordance with the plans, practices, programs and policies of the Company and its affiliated companies in effect for the Executive from time to time. After a Change of Control, such fringe benefits shall be provided in accordance with the most favorable plans, practices, programs and policies of the Company and its affiliated companies in effect for the Executive at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Change of Control or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies.
(vii)
Office and Support Staff
During the Employment Period, the Executive shall be entitled to an office and support staff in accordance with the practices and policies of the Company and its affiliated companies in effect for the Executive from time to time. After a Change of Control, the Executive shall be entitled to an office or offices of a size and with furnishings and other appointments, and to exclusive personal secretarial and other assistance, at least equal to the most favorable of the foregoing provided to the Executive by the Company and its affiliated companies at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Change of Control or, if more favorable to the Executive, as provided generally at any time thereafter with respect to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies.
(viii)
Vacation
During the Employment Period, the Executive shall be entitled to paid vacation in accordance with the plans, policies, programs and practices of the Company and its affiliated companies in effect for the Executive from time to time. After a Change of Control, the Executive shall be entitled to vacation in accordance with the most favorable plans, policies, programs and practices of the Company and its affiliated companies as in effect for the Executive at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Change or Control or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies.
5. Termination of Employment
(a) Death or Disability
The Executive's employment shall terminate automatically upon the Executive's death during the Employment Period. If the Company determines in good faith that the Disability of the Executive has occurred during the Employment Period (pursuant to the definition of Disability set forth below), it may give to the Executive written notice in accordance with Section 12(b) of this Agreement of its intention to terminate the Executive's employment. In such event, the Executive's employment with the Company shall terminate effective on the 30th day after receipt of such notice by the Executive (the "Disability Effective Date"), provided that, within the 30 days after such receipt, the Executive shall not have returned to full-time performance of the Executive's duties with or without reasonable accommodation. For purposes of this Agreement, "Disability" shall mean the absence of the Executive from the Executive's duties with the Company on a full-time basis for a period of (i) ninety (90) consecutive calendar days or (ii) an aggregate of one hundred fifty (150) calendar days in any fiscal year of the Company as a result of incapacity due to mental or physical illness which is determined to be total and permanent by a physician selected by the Company or its insurers and acceptable to the Executive or the Executive's legal representative (subject to compliance with all applicable laws).
(b) Cause
The Company may terminate the Executive's employment during the Employment Period for Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean:
(i) the willful and continued failure of the Executive to perform substantially the Executive's duties with the Company or one of its affiliates (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Executive by the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board or Chief Executive Officer believes that the Executive has not substantially performed the Executive's duties, or
(ii) the willful engaging by the Executive in illegal conduct or gross misconduct which is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company.
For purposes of this provision, no act or failure to act, on the part of the Executive, shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the Executive's action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or a senior officer of the Company or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company. The cessation of employment of the Executive shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a notice that the Executive is guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
(c) 
Good Reason
The Executive's employment may be terminated by the Executive during the Employment Period for Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean a "separation from service for good reason" as set forth in Code Section 409A, which shall mean that, without the express written consent of the Executive, one or more of the following shall have occurred without being timely remedied in the manner set forth below:
(i) A material diminution in the Executive's base compensation (except as provided for herein).
(ii) A material diminution in the Executive's authority, duties, or responsibilities.
(iii) A material diminution in the authority, duties, or responsibilities of the supervisor to whom the Executive is required to report.
(iv) A material change in the geographic location at which the Executive must perform the services.
(v) Any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company of the agreement under which the Executive provides services.
The Executive shall have "Good Reason" in connection with any or all of the above solely if (A) the Executive provides notice to the Company of the existence of the particular condition, action or inaction which the Executive considers to give the Executive "Good Reason" within ninety (90) days of the initial existence of the condition, or the action or inaction, and (B) the Company shall not have remedied the condition, action or inaction within thirty (30) days of its receipt of the Executive's notice. The effective date of any termination for "Good Reason" shall be no later than twelve (12) months after the initial existence of such condition, action or inaction constituting "Good Reason."
(d) 
Notice of Termination
Any termination during the Employment Period by the Company for Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto given in accordance with Section 12(b) of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" means a written notice which (i) indicates the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) to the extent applicable, sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated, and (iii) if the Date of Termination (as defined below) is other than the date of receipt of such notice, specifies the termination date (which date shall be not more than thirty days after the giving of such notice). The failure by the Executive or the Company to set forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which contributes to a showing of Good Reason or Cause shall not waive any right of the Executive or the Company, respectively, hereunder or preclude the Executive or the Company, respectively, from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing the Executive's or the Company's rights hereunder.
(e) 
Date of Termination
"Date of Termination" means "termination of service" as such term is defined under Code Section 409A and shall be (i) if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, the effective date of termination specified in the Notice of Termination, (ii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company other than for Cause or Disability, the date on which the Company notifies the Executive of such termination, and (iii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of death or Disability, the date of death of the Executive or the Disability Effective Date, as the case may be.
6. Obligations of the Company upon Termination
(a) Good Reason; Other Than for Cause, Death or Disability
If, during the Employment Period, the Company shall terminate the Executive's employment other than for Cause or Disability or the Executive shall terminate employment for Good Reason:
(i) the Company shall pay to the Executive in a lump sum in cash within 30 days after the Date of Termination an amount equal to the present value, determined in accordance with Section 280G(d)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), of the aggregate of the following amounts under A, B and C below ; provided however that some or all of such payment shall be delayed if necessary to comply with Code Section 409A as provided in Section 12..

C. an amount equal to the difference between (a) the aggregate benefit under the Company's qualified defined benefit retirement plans (collectively, the "Retirement Plan") and any excess or supplemental defined benefit retirement plans (including the Benefit Restoration Plan) in which the Executive participates (collectively, the "SRP") which the Executive would have accrued (whether or not vested) if the Executive's employment had continued for one year (or three years if the Date of Termination occurs after a Change of Control or the Executive's Employment Period is extended to three years under the last paragraph of Section 1(b)) after the Date of Termination, but not after the date on which the Executive attains age 65, and (b) the actual vested benefit, if any, of the Executive under the Retirement Plan and the SRP, determined as of the Date of Termination (with the foregoing amounts to be computed on an actuarial present value basis, based on the assumption that the Executive's compensation in the year (or, if applicable, each of the three years) following such termination would have been that required by Section 4(b)(i) and Section 4(b)(ii), and using the actuarial assumptions in effect for purposes of computing benefit entitlements under the Retirement Plan and the SRP at the Date of Termination or, following a Change of Control, using actuarial assumptions no less favorable to the Executive than the most favorable assumptions which were in effect for such purposes at any time from the day before the Change of Control through the Date of Termination;
(ii) for one year (or three years if the Date of Termination occurs after a Change of Control or the Executive's Employment Period is extended to three years under the last paragraph of Section 1(b)) after the Executive's Date of Termination, or such longer period as may be provided by the terms of the appropriate plan, program, practice or policy, subject to compliance with Code Section 409A as provided in Section 12, the Company shall continue benefits to the Executive and/or the Executive's family at least equal to those which would have been provided to them in accordance with the plans, programs, practices and policies described in Section 4(b)(iv) of this Agreement if the Executive's employment had not been terminated or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies and their families; provided, however, that if the Executive becomes reemployed with another employer and is eligible to receive medical or other welfare benefits under another employer-provided plan, the medical and other welfare benefits described herein shall be secondary to those provided under such other plan during such applicable period of eligibility, and for purposes of determining eligibility (but not the time of commencement of benefits) of the Executive for retiree benefits pursuant to such plans, programs, practices and policies, the Executive shall be considered to have remained employed until one year (or three years if the Date of Termination occurs after a Change of Control or the Executive's Employment Period is extended to three years under the last paragraph of Section 1(b)) after the Date of Termination and to have retired on the last day of such period;

In such case, all Accrued obligations shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Date of Termination.
7. Non-exclusivity of Rights
Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive's continuing or future participation in any plan, program, policy or practice provided by the Company or any of its affiliated companies and for which the Executive may qualify, nor shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as the Executive may have under any contract or agreement with the Company or any of its affiliated companies. Amounts which are vested benefits or which the Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any plan, policy, practice or program of or any contract or agreement (other than this Agreement) with the Company or any of its affiliated companies at or subsequent to the Date of Termination shall be payable in accordance with such plan, policy, practice or program or contract or agreement except as explicitly modified by this Agreement.
8. Full Settlement; Offsets
Except as provided in this Section 8, the Company's obligation to make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which the Company may have against the Executive or others.
Executive shall not be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement. However, the amount of any payments and benefits provided for in this Agreement shall be reduced by one hundred percent (100%) of any benefits and earned income (within the meaning of Section 911(d)(2)(A) of the Code) which is earned by the Executive for services rendered to persons or entities other than the Company or its affiliates during or with respect to the Employment Period or, after a Change of Control, during the 36-month period after the Date of Termination. Medical and welfare benefits shall be offset as provided in Section 6(a)(ii).
Not less frequently than annually (by December 31 of each year), the Executive shall account to the Company with respect to all benefits and earned income earned by the Executive which are required hereunder to be offset against payments or benefits received by the Executive from the Company. If the Company has paid amounts in excess of those to which the Executive is entitled (after giving effect to the offsets provided above), the Executive shall reimburse the Company for such excess by December 31 of such year. The requirements imposed under this paragraph shall terminate on December 31 of the calendar year in which the Employment Period ends or, after a Change of Control, December 31 of the calendar year which includes the third anniversary of the Date of Termination.

After termination of the Executive's employment with the Company, the Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate or divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the Company and those designated by it. In no event shall an asserted or alleged violation of the provisions of this Section 10 constitute a basis for deferring or withholding any amounts otherwise payable to the Executive under this Agreement.
10. Successors
(a) This Agreement is personal to the Executive and without the prior written consent of the Company shall not be assignable by the Executive otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's legal representatives.
(b) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns.
(c) The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to assume expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law or otherwise.
11. Compliance with Code Section 409A
(a) All payments of "nonqualified deferred compensation" (within the meaning of Code Section 409A) are intended to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A, and shall be interpreted in accordance therewith. Neither party individually or in combination may accelerate any such deferred payment, except in compliance with Code Section 409A, and no amount shall be paid prior to the earliest date on which it is permitted to be paid under Code Section 409A. In the event that the Executive is determined to be a "key employee" (as defined and determined under Code Section 409A) of Company at a time when its stock is deemed to be publicly traded on an established securities market, payments determined to be "nonqualified deferred compensation" payable following termination of employment or Change in Control, to the extent required under Code Section 409A, shall be made no earlier than the earlier of (i) the last day of the sixth (6th) complete calendar month following such termination of employment, or (ii) the Executive's death. Any payment delayed by reason of the prior sentence shall bepaid out in a single lump sum on the first day of the month following the end of such required delay period in order to catch up to the original payment schedule. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no amendment may be made to this Agreement if it would cause the Agreement or any payment hereunder not to be in compliance with Code Section 409A.
(b) Unless otherwise expressly provided, any payment of compensation by Company to the Executive, whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, shall be made within two and one-half months (2 months) after the end of the later of the calendar year or the Company's fiscal year in which the Executive's right to such payment vests (i.e., is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture for purposes of Code Section 409A). Such amounts shall not be subject to the requirements of subsection (a) above applicable to "nonqualified deferred compensation."
1/2
(c) Section (a) above shall not apply to that portion of any amounts payable upon termination of employment which shall qualify as "involuntary severance" under Section 409A because such amount does not exceed the lesser of (1) two hundred percent (200%) of the Executive's annualized compensation from the Company for the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year during which the Date of Termination occurs, or (2) two hundred percent (200%) of the annual limitation amount under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code (the maximum amount of compensation that may be taken into account for purposes of a tax-qualified retirement plan) for the calendar year during which the Date of Termination occurs.
(d) All benefit plans, programs and policies sponsored by the Company shall comply with all requirements of Code Section 409A or be structured so as to be exempt from the application of Code Section 409A. In particular, all taxable expense reimbursement payments and in kind benefits provided to the Executive shall be structured in compliance with Code Section 409A and reimbursements shall be paid by the Company to the Executive by no later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Executive incurs such expenses, and the Executive shall take all actions necessary to claim all such reimbursements on a timely basis to permit the Company to make all such reimbursement payments prior to the end of said period.
(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that any payment or benefit constitutes non-exempt "nonqualified deferred compensation" for purposes of Section 409A, and such payment or benefit would otherwise be payable or distributable hereunder by reason of Employee's termination of employment, all references to Employee's termination of employment shall be construed to mean a "separation from service," as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h), and Employee shall not be considered to have a termination of employment unless such termination constitutes a "separation from service" with respect to Employee.
12. 
Miscellaneous
(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without reference to principles of conflict of laws. The captions of this Agreement are not part of the provisions hereof and shall have no force or effect. This Agreement may not be amended or modified otherwise than by a written agreement executed by the parties hereto or their respective successors and legal representatives subject to compliance with Section 12.
(b) All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given by hand delivery to the other party or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:
or to such other address as either party shall have furnished to the other in writing in accordance herewith. Notice and communications shall be effective when actually received by the addressee.
(c) The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement.
(d) The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such Federal, state, local or foreign taxes as shall be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.
(e) The Executive's or the Company's failure to insist upon strict compliance with any provision hereof or any other provision of this Agreement or the failure to assert any right the Executive or the Company may have hereunder, including, without limitation, the right of the Executive to terminate employment for Good Reason pursuant to Section 5(c)(i)-(iv) of this Agreement, shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such provision or right or any other provision or right of this Agreement.
13. Arbitration; Attorneys Fees
(a) The parties agree that any disputes, controversies or claims which arise out of or are related to this Agreement, Executive's employment or the termination of his employment, including, but not limited to, any claim relating to the purported validity, interpretation, enforceability or breach of this Agreement, and/or any other claim or controversy arising out of the relationship between the Executive and Company (or the nature of the relationship) or the continuation or termination of that relationship, including, but not limited to, claims that a termination was for Cause or for Good Reason, claims for breach of covenant, breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, wrongful termination, breach of contract, or intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation, breach of right of privacy, interference with advantageous or contractual relations, fraud, conspiracy or other tort or property claims of any kind, which are not settled by agreement between the parties, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the then-current Rules of Practice and Procedure for Employment Arbitration ("Rules") of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. ("JAMS").
The arbitration shall be before a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the JAMS Rules or otherwise by mutual agreement of the parties. The arbitration shall take place in Los Angeles County, California, unless the parties agree to hold the arbitration at another location. Depositions and other discovery shall be allowed in accordance with the JAMS Rules. The arbitrator shall apply the substantive law (and the law of remedies, if applicable) of the State of California or federal law, or both, as applicable to the claim(s) asserted.
(b) In consideration of the parties' agreement to submit to arbitration all disputes with regard to this Agreement and/or with regard to any alleged contract, or any other claim arising out of their conduct, the relationship existing hereunder or the continuation or termination of that relationship, and in further consideration of the anticipated expedition and the minimizing of expense of this arbitration remedy, the arbitration provisions of this Agreement shall provide the exclusive remedy, and each party expressly waives any right he or it may have to seek redress in any other forum. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration shall be final and binding upon the parties.
Either party may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration under this Agreement and to enforce an arbitration award. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, both the Company and the Executive agree that neither of them shall initiate or prosecute any lawsuit or administrative action in any way related to any claim covered by this Agreement.
(c) Any claim which either party has against the other party that could be submitted for resolution pursuant to this Section must be presented in writing by the claiming party to the other party within one year of the date the claiming party knew or should have known of the facts giving rise to the claim, except that claims arising out of or related to the termination of the Executive's employment must be presented by him within one year of the Date of Termination. Unless the party against whom any claim is asserted waives the time limits set forth above, any claim not brought within the time periods specified shall be waived and forever barred, even if there is a federal or state statute of limitations which would have given more time to pursue the claim.
(d) The Company shall advance the costs and expenses of the arbitrator. In any arbitration to enforce any of the provisions or rights under this Agreement, the unsuccessful party in such arbitration, as determined by the arbitrator, shall pay to the successful party or parties all costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred therein by such party or parties (including without limitation such costs, expenses and fees on any appeals), and if such successful party or parties shall recover an award in any such arbitration proceeding, such costs, expenses and attorneys' fees shall be included as part of such award. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, in no event shall the successful party or parties be entitled to recover an amount from the unsuccessful party for costs, expenses and attorneys' fees that exceeds the unsuccessful party's costs, expenses and attorneys' fees in connection with the action or proceeding.
(e) Any decision and award or order of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto and judgment thereon may be entered in the Superior Court of the State of California or any other court having jurisdiction.
(f) Each of the above terms and conditions shall have separate validity, and the invalidity of any part thereof shall not affect the remaining parts.
(g) Any decision and award or order of the arbitrator shall be final and binding between the parties as to all claims which were or could have been raised in connection with the dispute to the full extent permitted by law. In all other cases the parties agree that the decision of the arbitrator shall be a condition precedent to the institution or maintenance of any legal, equitable, administrative, or other formal proceeding by the employee in connection with the dispute, and that the decision and opinion of the arbitrator may be presented in any other forum on the merits of the dispute.

(i) the date on which a majority of members of the Company's Board of Directors is replaced during any twelve-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Company's Board of Directors before the date of the appointment or election; or

The definition of termination for "Good Reason" in the Employment Agreement is hereby amended in its entirety to provide as follows:
2. Good Reason.
For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean a "separation from service for good reason" as set forth in Code Section 409A, which shall mean that, without the express written consent of the Executive, one or more of the following shall have occurred without being timely remedied in the manner set forth below:
(i) A material diminution in the Executive's base compensation (except as provided in Executive's Employment Agreement with the Company).
(ii) A material diminution in the Executive's authority, duties, or responsibilities.
(iii) A material diminution in the authority, duties, or responsibilities of the supervisor to whom the Executive is required to report.
(iv) A material diminution in the budget over which the Executive retains authority.
(v) A material change in the geographic location at which the Executive must perform the services.
(vi) Any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company of the agreement under which the Executive provides services.
The Executive shall have "Good Reason" in connection with any or all of the above solely if (A) the Executive provides notice to the Company of the existence of the particular condition, action or inaction which the Executive considers to give the Executive "Good Reason" within ninety (90) days of the initial existence of the condition, or the action or inaction, and (B) the Company shall not have remedied the condition, action or inaction within thirty (30) days of its receipt of the Executive's notice. The effective date of any termination for "Good Reason" shall be no later than twelve (12) months after the initial existence of such condition, action or inaction constituting "Good Reason."
The Employment Agreement is hereby amended to add the following additional provision entitled "Compliance With Code Section 409A."
3. Compliance With Code Section 409A.
(a) All payments of "nonqualified deferred compensation" (within the meaning of Code Section 409A) are intended to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A, and shall be interpreted in accordance therewith. Neither party individually or in combination may accelerate any such deferred payment, except in compliance with Code Section 409A, and no amount shall be paid prior to the earliest date on which it is permitted to be paid under Code Section 409A. In the event that the Executive is determined to be a "key employee" (as defined and determined under Code Section 409A) of Company at a time when its stock is deemed to be publicly traded on an established securities market, payments determined to be "nonqualified deferred compensation" payable following termination of employment or Change in Control, to the extent required under Code Section 409A, shall be made no earlier than the earlier of (i) the last day of the sixth (6th) complete calendar month following such termination of employment, or (ii) the Executive's death. Any payment delayed by reason of the prior sentence shall be paid out in a single lump sum on the first day of the month following the end of such required delay period in order to catch up to the original payment schedule. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no amendment may be made to this Agreement if it would cause the Agreement or any payment hereunder not to be in compliance with Code Section 409A.
(b) Unless otherwise expressly provided, any payment of compensation by Company to the Executive, whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, shall be made within two and one-half months (2 months) after the end of the later of the calendar year or the Company's fiscal year in which the Executive's right to such payment vests (i.e., is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture for purposes of Code Section 409A). Such amounts shall not be subject to the requirements of subsection (a) above applicable to "nonqualified deferred compensation."
1/2
(c) Section (a) above shall not apply to that portion of any amounts payable upon termination of employment which shall qualify as "involuntary severance" under Section 409A because such amount does not exceed the lesser of (1) two hundred percent (200%) of the Executive's annualized compensation from the Company for the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year during which the Date of Termination occurs, or (2) two hundred percent (200%) of the annual limitation amount under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code (the maximum amount of compensation that may be taken into account for purposes of a tax-qualified retirement plan) for the calendar year during which the Date of Termination occurs.
(d) All benefit plans, programs and policies sponsored by the Company shall comply with all requirements of Code Section 409A or be structured so as to be exempt from the application of Code Section 409A. In particular, all taxable expense reimbursement payments and in kind benefits provided to the Executive shall be structured in compliance with Code Section 409A and reimbursements shall be paid by the Company to the Executive by no later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Executive incurs such expenses, and the Executive shall take all actions necessary to claim all such reimbursements on a timely basis to permit the Company to make all such reimbursement payments prior to the end of said period.
(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that any payment or benefit constitutes non-exempt "nonqualified deferred compensation" for purposes of Section 409A, and such payment or benefit would otherwise be payable or distributable hereunder by reason of Employee's termination of employment, all references to Employee's termination of employment shall be construed to mean a "separation from service," as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h), and Employee shall not be considered to have a termination of employment unless such termination constitutes a "separation from service" with respect to Employee.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Executive has executed this Amendment to Employment Agreement and, pursuant to the authorization from the Compensation and Executive Personnel Committee of the Board of Directors, the Company has caused this Agreement to be executed, all as of the day and year first above written.
