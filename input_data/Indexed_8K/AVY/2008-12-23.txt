Exhibit 10.11.1
Section 1.1 Background
Avery Dennison Corporation (the "Company" and successor to Avery International Corporation), a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, by resolution of its Board of Directors dated November 17, 1983, adopted the Avery International Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan effective as of December 1, 1983, and which by action of the Compensation and Executive Personnel Committee of the Board of Directors on April 23, 1998, was amended and restated to be the Avery Dennison Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "Plan") effective as of April 23, 1998, and which Plan by action of the Committee is further amended and restated effective as of April 22, 2004, as set forth herein. Between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2008, the Plan was operated in accordance with transition relief established by the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service pursuant to Code Section 409A. The Plan is amended and restated effective as of January 1, 2009 to bring the Plan into compliance with Code Section 409A and the Treasury Regulations issued by the Treasury Department on April 10, 2007 and effective January 1, 2009.
The Plan constitutes an unfunded "excess benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(36) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"). The Plan is maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred Compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees, within the meaning of ERISA Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1).
The Plan is intended to comply with Code Section 409A and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Any provision of this document that is contrary to the requirements of Code Section 409A or the Treasury Regulations thereunder shall be null void and of no effect and the Plan shall be interpreted and administered consistent with the requirements of Code Section 409A, which shall govern the administration of the Plan in the event of a conflict between the Plan terms and the requirements of Code Section 409A and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.
Section 1.2 Purpose
The purpose of the Plan is to provide its participants with (i) additional incentive to further the growth, development and financial success of the Company, and (ii) an inducement to remain in the service of the Company, by offering benefits to supplement other benefits they may be entitled to receive at the time of their retirement.
Section 1.3 Definitions
Whenever the terms below are used in the Plan with the first letter capitalized, they shall have the meaning specified below. Capitalized terms used in the Plan and not defined below or in a Letter of Grant shall have the meanings attributed to those terms under the BRP.
Section 1.409A-1(a)(2).
Section 1.4 Source of Benefits
The Plan shall be an unfunded promise of the Company or applicable Company Affiliates to make payments in accordance with its terms. All SERP Benefits payable under the Plan shall be paid from the Company's general assets, and nothing contained in the Plan shall require the Company to set aside or hold in trust any funds for the benefit of a Participant or his Beneficiary, each of whom shall have the status of a general unsecured creditor with respect to the Company's obligation to make payments under the Plan. Any funds of the Company available to pay SERP Benefits under the Plan shall be subject to the claims of general creditors of the Company and may be used for any purpose by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company, in its sole discretion, shall have the authority to allocate the total liability to pay any SERP Benefit under the Plan to any applicable Employer as it deems appropriate.
Section 1.5 Administration
Responsibility for the administration of the Plan shall rest exclusively with the Committee.
The Participants in the Plan shall be those Employees of the Company or any Company Affiliate who are so designated by the Committee.
Section 3.1 Benefit Formula
The SERP Benefit payable to a Participant under the Plan, including any preretirement death benefits payable to his Beneficiary, shall be determined by the Committee at the time he is designated as a Participant and shall be set forth in a Letter of Grant. In general terms, the benefit will be based on a designated percentage of his Average Compensation.
Section 3.2 Vesting
A Participant shall be fully vested in his SERP Benefit upon attaining age 65 while an employee of the Company, or upon any such earlier date as the Committee designates with respect to him. Otherwise non-vested SERP Benefits shall vest upon the Participant's death or Disability while an employee of the Company; or upon his involuntary Separation from Service without Cause, which includes an involuntary Separation from Service due to a Change in Control; or upon his Separation from Service for Good Reason; provided, however, the vesting provisions set forth in a Letter of Grant if different shall control.
Section 4.1 Form of Payment
The form in which each Participant's SERP Benefit is paid under the Plan shall be the same form of payment either specified or, if applicable, elected under the terms of the BRP. A Participant who had not received or commenced to receive SERP Benefits as of December 31, 2008, was permitted to make a 2008 Transition Election regarding the form of payment.
Section 4.2 Time of Payment
Section 4.3 Combined Cashout
Section 4.4 Other Permissible Delays or Accelerations
If the Committee determines that a delay or an acceleration of a benefit is appropriate and complies with the requirements under Code Section 409A (, a delay to comply with Code Section 162(m) or an acceleration to pay employment taxes), the Committee may either delay or accelerate the payment of a Benefit in accordance with the terms of Code Section 409A in its sole discretion as it deems advisable. If any payment is delayed in accordance with this provision, the Company shall pay such delayed payments together with Interest upon the expiration of the period of the delay.
e.g.
To the extent a vested SERP Benefit is first payable due to the death of the Participant, and the Participant is survived by the spouse to whom he was married on his date of his death, such spouse shall be entitled to a Death Benefit paid at the same time and in the same form as the "death benefit" under the BRP. The Death Benefit payable under the Plan shall be the Actuarial Equivalent amount of the SERP Benefit that would be payable if, before the Participant's date of the death, the Participant attained age 65 (or such other age specified in a Letter of Grant), commenced his SERP Benefit in the form of a Joint and Survivor Annuity (based on a percentage designated by the Committee, which generally shall be 50%), and then died.
If a Participant is not married at the time of his death before his Benefit Commencement Date, then all SERP Benefits with respect to the Participant shall be forfeited. To the extent a Participant dies after another Payment Event has occurred, but before his Benefit Commencement Date, the Benefit shall be accelerated and the amount described under Section 4.5 of the BRP shall be paid to the Beneficiary in a Lump Sum, as permitted under Code Section 409A and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.
Section 6.1 Designation
At any time prior to the first payment hereunder a Participant shall have the right to designate, revoke or redesignate a Joint/Contingent Annuitant to receive the survivor portion of any SERP Benefits paid in the form of an Annuity under the Plan in accordance with the Participant's designated form of benefit; provided, that the Joint /Contingent Annuitant shall be the same individual designated by the Participant for an Annuity under the BRP. Designation, revocation and redesignation of Joint/Contingent Annuitant shall be made in writing in accordance with procedures established by the Committee.
Section 7.1 Administrative Authority and Actions
The "Administrator" (the Committee or its delegate), shall conduct the general administration of the Plan and shall have the necessary power and authority to interpret any provisions of the Plan and specifically to determine a person's status as a Participant and the SERP Benefits which he shall receive. In carrying out its responsibilities, the Administrator shall have the power and authority to engage actuaries, attorneys, accountants or other consultants necessary to provide advice and consultation if, in the determination of the Committee, such consultation is required to interpret or implement any provision of the Plan properly and equitably.
Section 7.2 Binding Determinations
All actions taken and all determinations made by the Administrator in good faith shall be final and binding upon all Participants and any person interested in the Plan.
Section 8.1 Claims Procedures
The claims procedures hereunder shall be in accordance with the claims procedures set forth in the Qualified Plan; provided that for purposes of the claims procedures under this Plan, the review official described in the Qualified Plan shall be the Committee
.
Section 9.1 Payment
The receipt of any person entitled to payment under the Plan (or payment to such person at the last address on file with the Company) shall be a complete discharge to the Company, its directors and employees, and the Administrator. If the Administrator determines that a person entitled to a payment under the Plan is unable (by reason of physical or mental condition) to give a valid receipt for such payment, payment shall instead be made to such other person found by the Administrator to have assumed the care of such person.
Section 9.2 Amendment, Termination or Suspension of the Plan
Section 9.3 Limitation on Rights of Employees
The Plan is strictly a voluntary undertaking on the part of the Company and shall not constitute a contract between the Company and any Employee, or consideration for, or an inducement or condition of, the employment of an Employee. Nothing contained in the Plan shall give any Employee the right to be retained in the service of the Company or to interfere with or restrict the right of the Company, which is hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or retire any Employee, except as provided by law, at any time without notice and with or without cause. Inclusion under the Plan will not give any Employee any right or claim to any benefit hereunder except to the extent such right has specifically become fixed under the terms of the Plan and there are funds available therefore in the hands of the Company. The doctrine of substantial performance shall have no application to Employees, Participants or any other persons entitled to payments under the Plan. Each condition and provision, including numerical items, has been carefully considered and constitutes the minimum limit on performance, which will give rise to the applicable right.
Section 9.4 Plan Binding in Event of Consolidation or Merger; Adoption of Plan by Other Companies
Section 9.5 Assignments, etc. Prohibited
Section 9.6 Errors and Misstatements
Only to the extent permitted under Code Section 409A and any correction program that may be issued thereunder, in the event of any misstatement or omission of fact by a Participant to the Committee or any clerical error resulting in payment of SERP Benefits in an incorrect amount, the Committee shall promptly cause the amount of future payments to be corrected upon discovery of the facts and shall cause the Company to pay the Participant or any other person entitled to payment under the Plan any underpayment in cash in a Lump Sum or to recoup any overpayment from future payments to the Participant or any other person entitled to payment under the Plan in such amounts as the Committee shall direct or to proceed against the Participant or any other person entitled to payment under the Plan for recovery of any such overpayment.
Section 9.7 Payment on Behalf of Minor, Etc.
In the event any amount becomes payable under the Plan to a minor or a person who, in the sole judgment of the Committee is considered by reason of physical or mental condition to be unable to give a valid receipt therefore, the Committee may direct that such payment be made to any person found by the Committee in its sole judgment, to have assumed the care of such minor or other person. Any payment made pursuant to such determination shall constitute a full release and discharge of the Company, the Board, the Committee and their officers, directors and employees.

This Plan shall be construed, administered and governed in all respects under and by applicable federal laws and, where, state law is applicable, the laws of the State of California.

Titles are provided herein for convenience only and are not to serve as a basis for interpretation or construction of the Plan.

Unless the context clearly indicates to the contrary, a reference to a statute, regulation or document shall be construed as referring to any subsequently enacted, adopted or executed statute, regulation or document.
Section 9.12 Effective Date

Exhibit 10.11.2.1
Mr. Dean A. Scarborough President and Chief Executive Officer Avery Dennison Corporation 150 North Orange Grove Boulevard Pasadena, California 91103
Dear Mr. Scarborough:
Avery Dennison Corporation ("Company") is adopting an amended and restated Avery Dennison Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("Plan") effective as of January 1, 2009. The amended and restated Plan contains the necessary provisions to bring the Plan into compliance with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A ("Section 409A"). By complying with the requirements of Section 409A, the benefits provided under such nonqualified deferred compensation plan may continue to be tax deferred. This letter is written to advise you of the changes that the Compensation and Executive Personnel Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company has made to the Plan in order to comply with Section 409A.
. As an inducement for you to remain in the service of the Company, and to provide you with additional incentive to further the growth, development and financial success of the Company, the Company will continue to provide you with a SERP Benefit that is determined in accordance with the provisions below and subject to the terms of the Plan.
Calculation of SERP Benefit
Your "SERP Benefit" is equal to the annual payment of a straight life annuity commencing the first day of the month following the month in which you attain age 65 (or the month in which a Payment Event occurs, if later) with each annual payment equal to sixty-two and one-half percent (62.5%) of your Average Compensation. To the extent your Benefit Commencement Date is before the date you attain age 65, you will receive a SERP Benefit that is Actuarially Equivalent to the SERP Benefit payable to you on the first day of the month following the date you attain age 65.
Finally, your SERP Benefit will be further reduced by the Specified Formula Reductions.
. Your SERP Benefit will be paid on the Benefit Commencement Date determined under the Amended and Restated Benefit Restoration Plan of Avery Dennison Corporation ("BRP") and in accordance with the form of payment specified or, if applicable, elected under the BRP.
Time and Form of Payment
. If you are a Key Employee, as determined under the Avery Dennison Corporation Key Employee Policy or by the Committee for all nonqualified plan in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 409A, and your SERP Benefit is payable due to your Separation from Service, as described under the BRP, your Benefit Commencement Date will be no earlier than the first day of the month that is coincident with or next following the date that is six months after your Separation from Service, unless an earlier payment complies with a permissible Section 409A exception (, the payment of employment taxes). To the extent your status as a Key Employee results in a delayed payment, then, following the end of such six-month period, the Plan will provide you with a one-time payment equal to the amount you would have been entitled to receive if your Benefit Commencement Date had not been delayed due to your status as a Key Employee, together with Interest.
Key Employee Delay
e.g.
. You will become vested in your SERP Benefit upon the earliest of the following dates provided, in the event of (1), (2), or (3), you are an Employee on that date:
Vesting
(1) The date you attain age 65;
(2) The date you suffer a Disability;
(3) The date of your death;
. In the event you are terminated by the Company for Cause before you attain age 65, you will forfeit your entire SERP Benefit under the Plan.
Forfeiture
. Upon your death, a Death Benefit will be paid only to the spouse to whom you were married on the date of your death; payment will be made in a Lump Sum (which is the form in which the "death benefit" under the BRP is paid) at the same time as the "death benefit" under the BRP, provided such spouse is then living.
Death Benefit
The amount of the Lump Sum Death Benefit payable to your spouse will be Actuarially Equivalent to the amount that would have been payable to your spouse as a survivor benefit hereunder if before your date of death you attained age 65 (or your actual age, if you are older), commenced benefits in the form of a 50% Joint and Survivor Annuity, and then died.
No Death Benefit will be payable hereunder or under the Plan if you die while unmarried before any scheduled Benefit Commencement Date.
. For purposes of determining your rights hereunder and under the Plan, the terms:
Definitions
Neither future amendments nor termination of the Plan will adversely affect the SERP Benefit to be provided hereunder or under the Plan without your prior written consent. The rights provided hereunder and under the Plan may not be sold, pledged, assigned or transferred in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, or in accordance with a domestic relations order as described in the Plan.
Please acknowledge your receipt and acceptance of this Letter of Grant, and your agreement to be bound by all of the terms hereof and of the Plan, by countersigning and dating the enclosed copy of this letter in the space provided below and returning the same to me.
