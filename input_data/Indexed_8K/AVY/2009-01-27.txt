The amendment increases the typical annual interest rate of the Revolver to the annual rate of, at the Company's option, either (i) between LIBOR plus 1.800% and LIBOR plus 3.500%, depending on the Company's debt ratings by either S&P or Moody's, or (ii) the higher of (A) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (B) the prime rate, plus between 0.800% and 2.500%, depending on the Company's debt ratings by either S&P or Moody's.

ADOPC's payment and performance under the agreement remain guaranteed by the Company. The amendment increases the Company's flexibility for a specified period of time under the customary financial covenants to which the Credit Facility is subject and excludes certain restructuring charges from the calculation of certain ratios under those covenants. The amendment also increases the typical annual interest rate of the Credit Facility to the annual rate of, at ADOPC's option, either (i) between LIBOR plus 2.000% and LIBOR plus 4.000%, depending on the Company's debt ratings by either S&P or Moody's, or (ii) the higher of (A) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (B) the prime rate, plus between 1.000% and 3.000%, depending on the Company's debt ratings by either S&P or Moody's.

AVERY DENNISON PRELIMINARY CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME (In millions, except per share amounts)
 
 
A-2
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Accordance with SEC Regulations G and S-K
Avery Dennison reports financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and herein provides some non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the Company's presentation of its financial results that are prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company's non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain events, activities or strategic decisions. The accounting effects of these events, activities or decisions, which are included in the GAAP measures, may make it difficult to assess the underlying performance of the Company in a single period. By excluding certain accounting effects, both positive and negative (e.g. gains on sales of assets, restructuring charges, asset impairments, effects of acquisitions and related costs, etc.), from certain of the Company's GAAP measures, the Company believes that it is providing meaningful supplemental information to facilitate an understanding of the Company's "core" or "underlying" operating results. These non-GAAP measures are used internally to evaluate trends in the Company's underlying business, as well as to facilitate comparison to the results of competitors for a single period. The Company applies the anticipated full-year GAAP tax rate to the non-GAAP adjustments to determine adjusted non-GAAP net income.
Limitations associated with the use of the Company's non-GAAP measures include (1) the exclusion of items that recur from time to time (e.g. restructuring, asset impairment charges, discontinued operations, etc.) from calculations of the Company's earnings and operating margin; (2) the exclusion of the effects of acquisitions, including integration costs and certain financing costs; (3) the exclusion of interest expense from the calculation of the Company's operating margin; and (4) the exclusion of any mandatory debt service requirements, as well as the exclusion of other uses of the cash generated by operating activities that do not directly or immediately support the underlying business (such as discretionary debt reductions, dividends, share repurchase, acquisitions, etc.) for calculation of free cash flow. While some of the items the Company excludes from GAAP measures recur, these items tend to be disparate in amount and timing. Based upon feedback from investors and financial analysts, the Company believes that supplemental non-GAAP measures provide information that is useful to the assessment of the Company's performance and operating trends.
The reconciliation set forth below is provided in accordance with Regulations G and S-K and reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
