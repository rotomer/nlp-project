Item 1.01
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On April 8, 2010, Avery Dennison Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), entered into an underwriting agreement with Banc of America Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein, with respect to a registered public offering of $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.375% Senior Notes due 2020 (the "Notes"). The closing of the sale of the Notes occurred on April 13, 2010. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses, were approximately $247,600,000 and are being used to repay a portion of the indebtedness outstanding under the term loan credit facility of one of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries.
The offering of the Notes was registered under an effective Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-147369).
The Notes are being issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of November 20, 2007, as supplemented by a supplemental indenture, dated as of April 13, 2010 (as supplemented, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee. The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.375% per year, payable semiannually in arrears in cash on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on October 15, 2010. The Notes will mature on April 15, 2020. The Company may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and an applicable make-whole amount as described in the Indenture. If a change of control triggering event as described in the Indenture occurs, the Company will be required to offer to repurchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date.
The Notes will be the Company's unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. The Notes will rank equal in right of payment to all of the Company's existing and future subordinated indebtedness; senior in right of payment to all of the Company's existing and future subordinated indebtedness; effectively junior to all of the Company's future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries. A copy of the Indenture is attached hereto and is hereby filed. The descriptions of the Indenture and the Notes in this report are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by the terms of the Indenture and Notes, respectively.
Attached hereto as exhibits are the agreements and opinions relating to the offering. The exhibits are expressly incorporated into the Registration Statement on Form S-3, and any related amendments thereto, filed by the Company on November 14, 2007.

omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
     (b)     Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in Section 7(a), but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the following: (i) the names of the Underwriters on the cover pages of the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus; (ii) the names of the Underwriters in the table in the first paragraph under the caption "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus; and (iii) the first paragraph under the caption "Underwriting  Commissions and Discounts", the third and fourth sentences of the first paragraph under the caption "Underwriting  New Issue of Notes, and the first paragraph under the caption "Underwriting  Stabilization and Short Positions" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus.
Indemnification of the Company.  
     (c)     If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either Section 7(a) or 7(b), such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person

shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 7 that the Indemnifying Party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred against presentation or written invoices or statements therefore. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by Banc of America Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final non-appealable judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
 
     (d)     If the indemnification provided for in Section 7(a) and 7(b) is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Notes and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Notes. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution.  
     (e)     The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 7(d). The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 7(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Notes exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability.

     (f)     The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.

     For purposes of the Change of Control Offer provisions, the following terms are applicable:
     "Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following:
     (a)     the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or more series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the Company's assets and the Company's Subsidiaries' assets, taken as a whole, to any person, other than the Company or one of the Company's Subsidiaries;

     (c)     the first day on which a majority of the members of the Company's Board of Directors are not Continuing Directors.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction shall not be deemed to involve a Change of Control if (a) the Company becomes a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of a holding company and (b)(1) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Company's Voting Stock immediately prior to that transaction or (2) immediately following that transaction no person (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of such holding company. The term "person," as used in this definition, has the meaning given thereto in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.

     "Rating Event" means the rating on the Notes is lowered by each of the Rating Agencies and the Notes are rated below Investment Grade by each of the Rating Agencies on any day within the 60-day period (which 60-day period will be extended so long as the rating of the notes is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies) after the earlier of (1) the occurrence of a Change of Control and (2) public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control or the Company's intention to effect a Change of Control; , , that a Rating Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating will not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus will not be deemed a Rating Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Triggering Event) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Company's or its request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control has occurred at the time of the Rating Event).
provided
however
     "S&P" means Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., and its successors.
     "Voting Stock" means, with respect to any specified "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date, the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such person.
     The Notes shall not be entitled to the benefit of any sinking fund.
     The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance and discharge at any time of (1) the entire indebtedness of the Notes or (ii) certain restrictive covenants and Events of Default with respect to the Notes, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
     If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared or shall become due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Notes, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Notes issued upon the registration
 
of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
     As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, no Holder shall have any right to institute any action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity for the execution of any trust under the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or for any other remedy hereunder, in each case with respect to an Event of Default with respect to the Notes, unless such Holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of the happening of one or more of the Events of Default, and unless also the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the Notes than Outstanding shall have requested the Trustee in writing to take action in respect of the matter complained of, and unless also there shall have been offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby, and the Trustee, for 60 days after receipt of such notification, request and offer of indemnity, shall have neglected or refused to institute any such action, suit or proceeding; and such notification, request and offer of indemnity are hereby declared in every such case to be conditions precedent to any such action, suit or proceeding by any Holder; it being understood and intended that no one or more of the Holders shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by his, her, its or their action to enforce any right under the Indenture, except in the manner therein provided, and that every action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity shall be instituted, had and maintained in the manner provided in the Indenture and for the equal benefit of all Holders of the Outstanding Notes.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of the Notes is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of the Notes for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes are payable, duly endorsed by or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, shall be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
     The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of U.S. $2,000 and integral multiple of U.S. $1,000 in excess thereof.

     No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company or the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
     Prior to due presentment of the Notes for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name the Notes are registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not the Notes be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
