Miller Corporate Center
For Immediate Release

Third Quarter Financial Summary  Preliminary
 
     "Avery Dennison delivered another quarter of strong top-line growth, driven by Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Information Services," said Dean A.
 
Scarborough, Avery Dennison chairman, president and CEO. "As expected, margins came under pressure as rising raw material costs outpaced price increases."
     "Despite the increased inflation, we remain on track to meet our full-year targets for earnings and free cash flow, and we are well positioned for long-term profitable growth and increased returns," Scarborough said.
     For more details on the Company's results, see the Company's supplemental presentation materials, "Third Quarter 2010 Financial Review and Analysis," posted at the Company's Web site at www.investors.averydennison.com, and furnished under Form 8-K with the SEC.

2010 Outlook
The Company has adjusted its previous guidance. In the Company's supplemental presentation materials, "Third Quarter 2010 Financial Review and Analysis," the Company provides a list of factors that it believes will contribute to its 2010 financial results. Based on the factors listed and other assumptions, the Company now expects reported revenue growth of approximately 9 percent, and adjusted (non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share of $3.10 to $3.20. The increase in guidance for Earnings Per Share is primarily due to the inclusion of approximately $0.40 per share from a discrete tax planning event expected in the fourth quarter of 2010. The Company now expects Free Cash Flow in 2010 of approximately $350 to $375 million.
 
Note: Throughout this release and the supplemental presentation materials, all calculations of amounts on a per share basis reflect fully diluted shares outstanding.

AVERY DENNISON PRELIMINARY CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME (In millions, except per share amounts)
 
 
A-2
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Accordance with SEC Regulations G and S-K
Avery Dennison reports financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and herein provides some non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the Company's presentation of its financial results that are prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company's non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain events, activities or strategic decisions. The accounting effects of these events, activities or decisions, which are included in the GAAP measures, may make it difficult to assess the underlying performance of the Company in a single period. By excluding certain accounting effects, both positive and negative (e.g. restructuring charges, asset impairments, legal settlements, certain effects of acquisitions and related integration costs, loss from debt extinguishment, loss from curtailment and settlement of pension obligations, gains or losses on sale of certain assets, etc.), from certain of the Company's GAAP measures, the Company believes that it is providing meaningful supplemental information to facilitate an understanding of the Company's "core" or "underlying" operating results. These non-GAAP measures are used internally to evaluate trends in the Company's underlying business, as well as to facilitate comparison to the results of competitors for a single period. The Company adjusted the estimated GAAP tax rate to exclude the full year estimated tax effect of charges for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments, restructuring costs and asset impairment and lease cancellation charges, legal settlements, loss from debt extinguishment, loss from curtailment and settlement of pension obligations, gain on sale of investment, as well as a discrete tax event in the Fourth Quarter of 2010 to determine its adjusted non-GAAP tax rate to derive non-GAAP net income.
Limitations associated with the use of the Company's non-GAAP measures include (1) the exclusion of items that recur from time to time (e.g. restructuring, asset impairment charges, discontinued operations, etc.) and items that occur infrequently (e.g. legal settlement costs, loss from debt extinguishment) from calculations of the Company's earnings and operating margin; (2) the exclusion of certain effects of acquisitions, including integration costs and certain financing costs; (3) the exclusion of interest expense from the calculation of the Company's operating margin; and (4) the exclusion of any mandatory debt service requirements, as well as the exclusion of other uses of the cash generated by operating activities that do not directly or immediately support the underlying business (such as discretionary debt reductions, dividends, share repurchase, acquisitions, etc.) for calculation of free cash flow. While certain items that the Company excludes from GAAP measures recur, these items tend to be disparate in amount and timing. Based upon feedback from investors and financial analysts, the Company believes that supplemental non-GAAP measures provide information that is useful to the assessment of the Company's performance and operating trends.
The reconciliation set forth below is provided in accordance with Regulations G and S-K and reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
