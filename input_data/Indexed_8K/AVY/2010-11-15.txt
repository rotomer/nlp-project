Item 8.01 Other Events.
On November 15, 2010, Avery Dennison Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), closed the remarketing of $109,351,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.350% Senior Notes due 2020 (the "Notes") that form a component of the Company's Corporate HiMEDS Units. The remarketing was conducted pursuant to a remarketing agreement, dated September 27, 2010 (the "Remarketing Agreement"), between the Company and JPM Securities LLC, as Remarketing Agent, a copy of which is attached hereto and is hereby filed. The Company originally issued the Notes in 2007 pursuant to an indenture, dated as of November 20, 2007, as supplemented by a first supplemental indenture, dated as of November 20, 2007 (as supplemented, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly known as the Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.), as Trustee.
The remarketing of the Notes was registered under an effective Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-169954). In the remarketing, the Company purchased all of the Notes. Upon closing of the remarketing, the Company tendered $109,351,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes, representing all such series issued under the Indenture that remained outstanding, to the Trustee for cancellation, and the Notes were thereby cancelled and the Indenture solely with respect to the Notes was satisfied and discharged.
On November 15, 2010, the Company issued an aggregate of 2,133,656 shares of its common stock, par value $1.00 per share, to holders of outstanding Corporate HiMEDS Units in settlement of the obligation of the holders to purchase shares of the Company's common stock pursuant to the purchase contract component of the Company's Corporate HiMEDS Units. The Company received $109,351,000 in cash proceeds (before giving effect to cash in lieu of fractional shares that the Company paid to such holders) for the shares of common stock, which offset in part the $109,624,378 purchase price of the Notes.
Attached hereto as exhibits are the Remarketing Agreement and the opinions relating to the remarketing of the Notes and the issuance of common stock. The exhibits are expressly incorporated into the Registration Statement on Form S-3, and any related amendments thereto, filed by the Company on October 15, 2010.

     (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless the Remarketing Agent, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Remarketing Agent may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplement thereto, or any related Preliminary Prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, any other Time of Sale Information, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse the Remarketing Agent for any legal expenses of one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) engaged reasonably incurred by the Remarketing Agent in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance
provided, however

     (b) The Remarketing Agent will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related Preliminary Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus supplement, or any related Preliminary Prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, any other Time of Sale Information, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any other Remarketing Materials, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Remarketing Agent specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; that in no case will the Remarketing Agent be liable or responsible for any amount in excess of the fee paid to the Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 4.
provided
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to subsection (a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Remarketing Agent. In case any such action shall be brought against the indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation (as set forth below). Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or the indemnified party which are
 
different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 11 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Section 12.
Contribution.
     (a) If the indemnification provided for in Section 11 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Sections 11(a) or 11(b), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other from the offering of the Remarketed Senior Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other in connection with the statements of omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other hand in connection with the Remarketing shall be deemed to be in the same proportions as the total net proceeds of the Remarketed Senior Notes less the fee paid to the Remarketing Agent on the one hand and the fee paid to the Remarketing Agent on the other hand bear to the total net proceeds of the Remarketed Senior Notes. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Remarketing Agent on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Remarketing Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (a) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (a). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (a) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
