Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e) On December 9, 2010, the Compensation and Executive Personnel Committee ("Committee") of the Board of Directors of Avery Dennison Corporation (the "Company") approved  subject to obtaining the requisite agreement of plan participants  the freezing of benefits under the Avery Dennison Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (as amended and restated, the "SERP") based on the participants average compensation (as defined in the SERP) as of December 31, 2010, rather than the participants final average compensation as of the date of retirement. Benefits under the SERP at the time of retirement will continue to be reduced by (i) any benefits to which the participants are otherwise entitled under the Companys Pension Plan and Benefit Restoration Plan; (ii) certain Company contributions to the Companys 401(k) plan; (iii) fixed amounts representative of contributions (plus interest) to the Companys deferred compensation plans; and (iv) estimated Social Security benefits. As consideration for, and effective upon, their voluntary agreement to the freezing of contractual SERP benefits, the Committee determined that the SERPs only active participants  Dean A. Scarborough, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, and Daniel OBryant, Executive Vice President, Business Development (formerly Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer)  would be granted an option to purchase shares of the Companys common stock, the number of which was determined by the Committee by evaluating the present value of the shortfall to each participant projected to be caused by the freezing of the remaining SERP benefits and to provide an additional incentive to create stockholder value. On December 13, 2010, upon his written agreement to the freezing of his contractual SERP benefits, Mr. Scarborough was granted an option to purchase 200,000 shares of the Companys common stock, the same number of s hares as the grant he received in February 2010 as part of the Committees annual equity award process. On December 14, 2010, upon his written agreement to the freezing of his contractual SERP benefits, Mr. OBryant was granted an option to purchase 16,000 shares of the Companys common stock. Both options vest ratably over a four-year period. The Committee determined to freeze participants SERP benefits to (i) be consistent with the Companys previously-disclosed decision to freeze the accrual of benefits under two of its U.S. defined benefit plans for all employees eligible to participate therein, effective December 31, 2010; (ii) reduce the Companys overall exposure to accounting and cash flow volatility; and (iii) more closely align participants compensation with the Companys performance.
