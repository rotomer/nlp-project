Exhibit 99.1

PASADENA, Calif., April 27, 2011
(in millions, except per share amounts)
First Quarter Financial Summary  Preliminary
 
     "Avery Dennison delivered solid sales growth in the first quarter, with strong performances by Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Branding and Information Solutions," said Dean A. Scarborough, Avery Dennison chairman, president and CEO.
 
     "Pricing actions and productivity initiatives mitigated the impact on margins of increased raw material costs," Scarborough said. "We will continue to aggressively manage the impact of inflation.
     "As we expected, Office and Consumer Products had an extremely soft first quarter. We are confident that our investments in new products and demand creation will change the trajectory of this business," Scarborough said.
     "For the full year, we expect Avery Dennison to deliver solid growth, margin expansion and strong free cash flow that will support share repurchases later in the year," Scarborough said. "We are well positioned for long-term profitable growth and increased returns."
     For more details on the Company's results, see the Company's supplemental presentation materials, "First Quarter 2011 Financial Review and Analysis," posted at the Company's Web site at www.investors.averydennison.com, and furnished under Form 8-K with the SEC.

The first quarter effective GAAP tax rate was 34 percent. The adjusted tax rate for the first quarter increased from 22 to 25 percent, reflecting reduced benefits from discrete tax events this year.
Outlook
In the Company's supplemental presentation materials, "First Quarter 2011 Financial Review and Analysis," the Company provides a list of factors that it believes will contribute to its 2011 financial results. Based on the factors listed and other assumptions, the Company continues to expect adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings per share of $3.00 to $3.30 and free cash flow of $325 to $350 million in 2011.
Note: Throughout this release and the supplemental presentation materials, all calculations of amounts on a per share basis reflect fully diluted shares outstanding.

AVERY DENNISON PRELIMINARY CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME (In millions, except per share amounts)
 
A-2
Avery Dennison reports financial results in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, and herein provides some non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, the comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the Company's presentation of its financial results that are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Based upon feedback from investors and financial analysts, the Company believes that supplemental non-GAAP financial measures provide information that is useful to the assessment of the Company's performance and operating trends, as well as liquidity.
The Company's non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain events, activities or strategic decisions. The accounting effects of these events, activities or decisions, which are included in the GAAP financial measures, may make it difficult to assess the underlying performance of the Company in a single period. By excluding certain accounting effects, both positive and negative (e.g. restructuring charges, asset impairments, legal settlements, certain effects of acquisitions and related integration costs, loss from debt extinguishments, loss from curtailment and settlement of pension obligations, gains or losses on sale of certain assets, etc.), from certain of the Company's GAAP financial measures, the Company believes that it is providing meaningful supplemental information to facilitate an understanding of the Company's core or underlying operating results and liquidity measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are used internally to evaluate trends in the Company's underlying business, as well as to facilitate comparison to the results of competitors for a single period. While some of the items the Company excludes from GAAP financial measures recur, these items tend to be disparate in amount and timing. The Company adjusted the estimated GAAP tax rate to exclude the full year estimated tax effect of charges for restructuring costs, asset impairment and lease cancellation charges, and legal settlements to determine its adjusted non-GAAP tax rate to derive non-GAAP net income.
The Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying news release and presentation:
refers to the change in sales excluding the estimated impact of currency translation.
Organic sales growth (decline)
refers to earnings before taxes and interest expense, excluding restructuring charges and other items as a percentage of sales.
Non-GAAP operating margin
refers to as reported net income per common share, assuming dilution, adjusted for after tax non-GAAP adjustments per common share.
Adjusted non-GAAP net income per common share
refers to cash flow from operations, less net payments for property, plant, equipment, software and other deferred charges, plus net proceeds from sale (purchase) of investments. Free cash flow excludes mandatory debt service requirements and other uses of cash that do not directly or immediately support the underlying business (such as discretionary debt reductions, dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions, etc.).
Free cash flow
The reconciliation set forth below and in the accompanying presentation is provided in accordance with Regulations G and S-K and reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
