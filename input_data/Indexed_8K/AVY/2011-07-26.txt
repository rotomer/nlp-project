Actual results and trends may differ materially from historical or anticipated results depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to risks and uncertainties relating to the following: fluctuations in demand affecting sales to customers; the financial condition and inventory strategies of customers; changes in customer order patterns; worldwide and local economic conditions; fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials; ability of the Company to generate sustained productivity improvement; ability of the Company to achieve and sustain targeted cost reductions; impact of competitive products and pricing; loss of significant contract(s) or customer(s); collection of receivables from customers; selling prices; business mix shift; changes in tax laws and regulations; outcome of tax audits; timely development and market acceptance of new products, including sustainable or sustainably-sourced products; investment in development activities and new production facilities; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and other risks associated with foreign operations; integration of acquisitions and execution of divestitures; customer and supplier concentrations; successful implementation of new manufacturing technologies and installation of manufacturing equipment; disruptions in information technology systems; successful installation of new or upgraded information technology systems; volatility of financial markets; impairment of capitalized assets, including goodwill and other intangibles; credit risks; ability of the Company to obtain adequate financing arrangements and maintain access to capital; fluctuations in interest and tax rates; fluctuations in pension, insurance and employee benefit costs; impact of legal and regulatory proceedings, including with respect to environmental, health and safety; changes in governmental laws and regulations; changes in political conditions; impact of epidemiological events on the economy and the Company's customers and suppliers; acts of war, terrorism, and natural disasters; and other factors.
The Company believes that the most significant risk factors that could affect its financial performance in the near-term include (1) economic conditions on underlying demand for the Company's products (2) the degree to which higher costs can be offset with productivity measures and/or passed on to customers through selling price increases, without a significant loss of volume; (3) competitors' actions, including pricing, expansion in key markets, and product offerings; and (4) tax laws, regulations, and audits throughout the world.

PASADENA, Calif., July 26, 2011
Second Quarter Financial Summary  Preliminary
(in millions, except per share amounts)
 
 
 
 
 
    "During the second quarter, our two largest segments, Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Branding and Information Solutions, experienced a rapid decrease in unit volumes that drove results below expectations," said Dean Scarborough, Avery Dennison chairman, president and CEO. "We are taking action to reduce costs and increase productivity through this slowdown, and we expect to regain momentum when market conditions improve. We remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and increasing return of cash to shareholders."
    For more details on the Company's results, see the Company's supplemental presentation materials, "Second Quarter 2011 Financial Review and Analysis," posted at the Company's Web site at www.investors.averydennison.com, and furnished under Form 8-K with the SEC.
Second Quarter 2011 Results by Segment
All references to sales reflect comparisons on an organic basis, which exclude the estimated impact of currency translation. All references to operating margin exclude the impact of restructuring costs and other items.
Pressure-sensitive Materials (PSM)
 
 
Retail Branding and Information Solutions (RBIS)

Annualized savings associated with restructuring actions taken this year are expected to total approximately $40 million, with about one-third of the benefit to be realized in 2011. Total cash costs to implement these actions are expected to be approximately $25 million. The Company continues to identify and assess further opportunities to increase productivity through restructuring.
The second quarter effective GAAP tax rate was 34 percent. The year-to-date adjusted tax rate increased from 23% to 29%, reflecting geographic income mix and reduced benefit from discrete tax events.
Outlook
In the Company's supplemental presentation materials, "Second Quarter 2011 Financial Review and Analysis," the Company provides a list of factors that it believes will
contribute to its 2011 financial results. Based on the factors listed and other assumptions, the Company now expects adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings per share of between $2.45 and $2.75 and free cash flow of between $250 million and $275 million in 2011.
Note: Throughout this release and the supplemental presentation materials, all calculations of amounts on a per share basis reflect fully diluted shares outstanding.

Avery Dennison reports financial results in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, and herein provides some non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, the comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the Company's presentation of its financial results that are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Based upon feedback from investors and financial analysts, the Company believes that supplemental non-GAAP financial measures provide information that is useful to the assessment of the Company's performance and operating trends, as well as liquidity.
The Company's non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain events, activities or strategic decisions. The accounting effects of these events, activities or decisions, which are included in the GAAP financial measures, may make it difficult to assess the underlying performance of the Company in a single period. By excluding certain accounting effects, both positive and negative, of certain items (e.g. restructuring costs, asset impairments, legal settlements, certain effects of strategic transactions and related costs, loss from debt extinguishments, loss from curtailment and settlement of pension obligations, gains or losses on sale of certain assets and other items) from certain of the Company's GAAP financial measures, the Company believes that it is providing meaningful supplemental information to facilitate an understanding of the Company's core or underlying operating results and liquidity measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are used internally to evaluate trends in the Company's underlying business, as well as to facilitate comparison to the results of competitors for a single period. While some of the items the Company excludes from GAAP financial measures recur, these items tend to be disparate in amount, frequency and timing. The Company adjusted the estimated GAAP tax rate to exclude the full year estimated tax effect of restructuring costs and other items to determine its adjusted non-GAAP tax rate to derive non-GAAP net income.
The Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying news release and presentation:
refers to the increase or decrease in sales excluding the estimated impact of currency translation;
Organic sales change
refers to earnings before taxes and interest expense, excluding restructuring costs and other items, as a percentage of sales; 
Operating margin (non-GAAP)
refers to as reported net income per common share, assuming dilution, adjusted for the full year estimated tax effect of restructuring costs and other items; and
Adjusted (non-GAAP) EPS
refers to cash flow from operations, less net payments for property, plant, and equipment, software and other deferred charges, plus net proceeds from sale (purchase) of investments. Free cash flow excludes mandatory debt service requirements and other uses of cash that do not directly or immediately support the underlying business (such as discretionary debt reductions, dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions, etc.).
Free cash flow
The reconciliation set forth below and in the accompanying presentation is provided in accordance with Regulations G and S-K and reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
