Section 1Registrant's Business and Operations
 
On December 30, 2011, Avery Dennison Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively with the Company, "Sellers") entered into a Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 21, 2011 (the "Purchase Agreement"), with 3M Company, a Delaware corporation ("3M"), and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively with 3M, "Buyers"), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, Buyers agreed to purchase from Sellers all of the capital stock of certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company as well as certain assets of the Sellers, and assume certain liabilities of Sellers which, collectively, constitute the Company's Office and Consumer Products business (the "Business") for a total purchase price of $550 million in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments (the "Transaction").
The Company executed and delivered the Purchase Agreement on December 30, 2011 following the Company's receipt on December 21, 2011 of an offer from Buyers to consummate the Transaction (as amended, the "Offer Letter"). The Offer Letter was subject to the Company's compliance with the notification and consultation process with respect to the works council (the "Works Council") of Avery Dennison France, SAS, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company received the Works Council's final opinion on the Transaction and executed the Purchase Agreement within the periods prescribed by the Offer Letter.
The Transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including, without limitation, the receipt of all necessary governmental approvals and authorizations.
The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants relating to Sellers' conduct of the Business between the date of the signing of the Purchase Agreement and the closing of the Transaction. Under the Purchase Agreement, Sellers agreed to indemnify Buyers for certain breaches of representations, warranties and covenants.
In connection with the consummation of the Transaction, the parties agreed to enter into additional agreements at closing, including:
 
 
 
 
The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Purchase Agreement itself, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.
The Purchase Agreement and the above description of the Purchase Agreement have been included to provide investors and security holders with information regarding the terms of the Purchase Agreement. They are not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company, 3M, their respective subsidiaries and affiliates, or the Business. The Purchase Agreement contains representations and warranties of Sellers solely for the benefit of Buyers. The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties are qualified by information in a confidential disclosure letter that Sellers have delivered to Buyers in connection with signing the Purchase Agreement as of a specific date. The disclosure letter contains information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties of Sellers set forth in the Purchase Agreement. Therefore, investors and security holders should not treat them as categorical statements of fact. Moreover, these representations and warranties may apply standards of materiality in a way that is
 
different from what may be material to investors and were made only as of the date of the Purchase Agreement or such other date or dates as may be specified in the Purchase Agreement and are subject to more recent developments. Accordingly, investors and security holders should read the representations and warranties made by the Company and the other Sellers in the Purchase Agreement not in isolation but only in conjunction with the other information about the Company and its subsidiaries that the Company includes in the reports it files with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Miller Corporate Center
For Immediate Release
 Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE:AVY) today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to sell its Office and Consumer Products business ("OCP") to 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) for $550 million in cash. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.
PASADENA, Calif., January 3, 2012
"The sale of our Office and Consumer Products business to 3M presents the best opportunity to maximize OCP's value for Avery Dennison's shareholders, and complements 3M's global portfolio," said Dean A. Scarborough, Avery Dennison chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Our industry-leading Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Branding and Information Solutions businesses, combined with our strong balance sheet, make us well positioned for profitable growth and increased return of cash to shareholders."
Avery Dennison intends to use the proceeds from the transaction primarily to reduce debt, make additional pension contributions, and repurchase shares. This transaction will not negatively impact the Company's common stock dividend.
Avery Dennison's Office and Consumer Products business is one of the world's leading suppliers of printable media and other products, with expected sales in 2011 of approximately $765 million; and expected adjusted operating income and Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) in 2011 of approximately $80 million and $95 million, respectively. These adjusted operating income and EBITDA estimates exclude allocations of general corporate overhead. To
 
reduce costs, and in anticipation of an OCP transaction, Avery Dennison began implementing cost reduction actions as described in the Company's third quarter 2011 Form 10-Q.
Avery Dennison Corporation's pro forma sales in 2011, excluding OCP, are expected to be approximately $6 billion. All expectations herein of the performance of OCP and Avery Dennison are as of October 26, 2011, the date that the Company announced its third quarter 2011 results.
The transaction is expected to be completed in the second half of 2012.
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC advised Avery Dennison on the transaction. Latham & Watkins served as Avery Dennison's legal counsel.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted Operating Income for OCP refers to segment operating income before interest, taxes, restructuring charges, general overhead allocations and transaction costs.
EBITDA for OCP refers to Adjusted Operating Income before depreciation and amortization.
Avery Dennison's pro forma sales refers to net sales excluding OCP sales, adjusted for the positive impact on net sales from the change from intercompany supply of pressure-sensitive materials to agreed-upon supply of such materials to 3M.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, the comparable GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain events, activities or strategic decisions. The accounting effects of these events, activities or decisions, which are included in the GAAP financial measures, may make it difficult to assess the transaction. By excluding certain accounting effects, both positive and negative, from certain of our GAAP financial measures, we believe that we are providing meaningful supplemental information to facilitate an understanding of the transaction. These non-GAAP financial
 
measures are used internally to evaluate trends in our underlying business, as well as to facilitate comparison to the results of competitors for a single period. While some of the items we exclude from GAAP financial measures may recur, they tend to be disparate in amount, frequency, and timing.
