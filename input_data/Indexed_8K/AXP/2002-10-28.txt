EXHIBIT 99.1 NEWS RELEASE NEWS RELEASE NEWS RELEASE NEWS RELEASE NEWS Contact: Molly Faust Michael J. O'Neill 212/640-0624 212/640-5951 molly.faust@aexp.com mike.o'neill@aexp.com FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER NET INCOME RISES TO $687 MILLION Results Reflect Revenue Growth, Expense Controls and Strong Credit Quality New York - October 28, 2002 - AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY today reported third quarter net income of $687 million, up significantly from $298 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) rose to $0.52, up from $0.22 a year ago. Net revenues totaled $5.9 billion, up three percent from $5.7 billion a year ago. Net revenues on a managed basis totaled $5.7 billion, up four percent from $5.5 billion. The company's return on equity was 18.1 percent. Net income for the year-ago period included two significant items: a restructuring charge of $352 million pre-tax ($232 million after-tax) and one-time costs and waived customer fees of $98 million pre-tax ($65 million after-tax) resulting from the September 11th terrorist attacks. After adjusting the prior year results for these items, net income for the current quarter increased 15 percent. Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive officer, said: "The results reflect stronger revenue momentum in the card businesses, which more than offset the impact of weaker equity markets on our financial services business." 1
Mr. Chenault said American Express "also realized substantial benefit from cost control and risk management programs during the quarter. This -- along with lower funding costs," he said, "freed up substantial resources that were invested in additional marketing and business building activities. "Our performance this year demonstrates how the actions we have taken to adapt our business to a difficult market environment are not only generating solid results, but also providing added flexibility to invest in future growth initiatives." Mr. Chenault said, "We expect our more flexible, adaptable business model to allow us to generate solid earnings during the remainder of this year. We also expect to further increase our marketing programs. In view of that accelerated spending, and given the current business trends, we expect -- as we stated last quarter -- that earnings per share for the year will not exceed $2.01." TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES (TRS) reported quarterly net income of $553 million, more than doubling the $248 million earned a year ago. Last year's results included $195 million pre-tax ($127 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Also included in the year-ago results were $87 million pre-tax ($57 million after-tax) of one-time costs and waived customer fees resulting from the September 11th terrorist attacks. Excluding these year-ago items, TRS' net income for the current quarter grew 28 percent. 2
Total net revenues increased five percent from a year ago. Discount revenue rose five percent, reflecting a seven percent increase in business billed on American Express cards. The higher cardmember spending was partially offset by a decrease in the average discount rate. Net finance charge revenue increased 10 percent due to wider net-interest yields and loan balance growth. These revenue increases were partially offset by a decline in travel commissions and fees along with a decrease in Travelers Cheque investment income. Overall credit quality remained strong and, as a result, the total provision for losses declined six percent. The provision for charge card losses decreased, reflecting improved credit quality, while the lending provision increased, reflecting higher volume and continued uncertainty in the economic environment. Charge card interest expense decreased 33 percent due to lower funding costs and lower receivable balances. Human resources expense declined primarily as a result of lower staffing levels, outsourcing and other cost containment efforts. The benefit from lower funding costs, provisions and compensation-related expense, as well as ongoing reengineering initiatives, provided the resources to support a substantial increase in business building activities. Marketing and promotion expenses rose 31 percent from year-ago levels, reflecting expanded card acquisition programs and the introduction of new rewards-oriented card products during the quarter. Other operating expenses increased due in part to higher cardmember loyalty program costs and the impact of the technology outsourcing agreement with IBM. The above discussion presents TRS results on a "managed basis," as if there had been no cardmember lending securitization transactions. This is the basis used by management to evaluate operations and is consistent with industry practice. The attached financials present TRS results on both a managed and GAAP basis. Net income is the same in both formats. 3
On a GAAP basis, TRS results included net cardmember lending securitization gains of $9 million pre-tax ($6 million after-tax) and $29 million pre-tax ($19 million after-tax) in the third quarters of 2002 and 2001, respectively. AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS (AEFA) reported quarterly net income of $152 million, up five percent from $145 million a year ago. Quarterly net revenues of $901 million decreased slightly from a year ago. Included in the year-ago results were $62 million pre-tax ($41 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier and $11 million pre-tax ($8 million after-tax) of one-time costs resulting from the September 11th terrorist attacks. Excluding these year-ago items, AEFA's net income for the current quarter decreased 21 percent. The current quarter included a net $44 million pre-tax ($29 million after-tax) expense increase related to Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC). Assets under management and management fees declined from year-ago levels. The decline reflected continued weakness in equity markets and, to a lesser extent, outflows of managed assets, which were offset in part by a strong increase in sales of investment products and the related distribution fees. Human resources expenses decreased three percent as the benefits of reengineering and cost controls more than offset the rise in sales-related compensation. Other operating expenses increased 40 percent compared with last year largely due to the adjustments of DAC as well as the impact of the technology outsourcing agreement with IBM. 4
AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK (AEB) reported quarterly net income of $25 million compared with a net loss of $43 million a year ago. AEB results for the third quarter included a net benefit of $2 million pre-tax ($1 million after-tax) primarily related to adjustments to the restructuring reserves established last year. Included in year-ago results were $84 million pre-tax ($57 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Excluding these items, AEB's net income for the current quarter increased 67 percent from a year ago. AEB's results continued to benefit from strong performance in private banking and personal financial services, as well as lower funding costs and lower operating expenses as a result of reengineering efforts. These benefits were partially offset by a higher provision for losses, which was primarily due to higher write-offs in the consumer lending portfolio. CORPORATE AND OTHER reported net expenses of $43 million, compared with $52 million a year ago. Included in the 2002 results is a $23 million pre-tax ($20 million after-tax) preferred stock dividend based on earnings from Lehman Brothers, which was offset by expenses related to business building initiatives. This is the final dividend under the terms of this security. Included in third quarter 2001 results are $11 million pre-tax ($7 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. *** Due to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, effective January 1, 2002, no goodwill amortization occurred in the third quarter of 2002. In the year-ago period, goodwill amortization reduced pre-tax income by $25 million ($19 million after-tax), or $0.02 per share. American Express Company (www.americanexpress.com), founded in 1850, is a global travel, financial and network services provider. *** 5

(PRELIMINARY) AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FINANCIAL SUMMARY (Unaudited) # - Denotes a variance of more than 100%. (A) Managed net revenues are reported net of interest expense, where applicable, and American Express Financial Advisors' provision for losses and benefits, and exclude the effect of TRS' securitization activities. (B) On January 1, 2002 the company adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized but be subject to annual impairment tests. During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2001, goodwill amortization reduced pretax income by $25 million ($19 million after-tax) and $75 million ($58 million after-tax), respectively. (C) Included in 2001 income are two significant items: (a) restructuring charges of $352 million ($232 million after-tax) and (b) one-time costs (including waived fees) of $98 million ($65 million after-tax) resulting from the September 11th terrorist attacks. 9

(Preliminary) AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FINANCIAL SUMMARY (Unaudited) (A) Managed net revenues are reported net of interest expense, where applicable, and American Express Financial Advisors' provision for losses and benefits, and exclude the effect of TRS' securitization activities. (B) On January 1, 2002 the company adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized but be subject to annual impairment tests. During the fourth and third quarters of 2001, goodwill amortization reduced pretax income by $31 million ($24 million after-tax) and $25 million ($19 million after-tax), respectively. (C) Included in 2001 income are two significant items: (a) restructuring charges of $279 million ($179 million after-tax) and $352 million ($232 million after-tax) recognized in the fourth and third quarters, respectively, and (b) one-time costs (including waived fees) in the third quarter of $98 million ($65 million after-tax) resulting from the September 11th terrorist attacks. 11
(Preliminary) AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FINANCIAL SUMMARY (CONTINUED) (Unaudited) SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION (Unaudited) * Computed on a trailing 12-month basis excluding the effect on Shareholders' Equity of unrealized gains or losses related to SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," and SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." 12
(PRELIMINARY) TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES STATEMENTS OF INCOME (Unaudited, Managed Basis) # - Denotes a variance of more than 100%. (A) The third quarter 2001 disaster recovery charge excludes approximately $8 million of waived finance charges and late fees. Management views the gains from securitizations as discretionary benefits to be used for card acquisition expenses, which are reflected in both marketing and promotion and other operating expenses. Consequently, the above managed Statements of Income for the quarters ended September 30, 2002 and 2001 assume that gains of $9 million and $29 million, respectively, from lending securitizations were offset by higher marketing and promotion expense of $5 million and $16 million, respectively, and other operating expense of $4 million and $13 million, respectively. Accordingly, the incremental expenses, as well as the gains, have been eliminated. 13

Note: Certain prior period amounts have been restated to conform to current year presentation of securitization income. 14
(Preliminary) TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION (Unaudited) (A) Includes proprietary cards and cards issued under network partnership agreements outside the U.S. At September 30, 2002, 1.5 million of Canadian lending cards were transferred to basic, as (though available under a supplemental card program) the specific cards were issued under a stand-alone offer. The impact of this transfer on the quarter ended September 30, 2001 would have been to increase Basic Cards in Force Outside the U.S. to 16.6 million and decrease Average Basic Cardmember Spending to $1,792. Percentages of increase are calculated assuming the transfer had occurred at the time the cards were issued. (B) Computed from proprietary card activities only.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2002 HIGHLIGHTS o The Company achieved third quarter diluted EPS of $0.52 compared with $0.22 last year. Net revenues increased 3% on a GAAP reporting basis and 4% on a managed basis. For the trailing 12 months, ROE was 18%. - Positively impacting this years' comparison were: --The 3Q '01 restructuring charges of $352MM ($232MM after-tax); --The 3Q '01 costs and waived customer fees of $98MM ($65MM after-tax) related to the terrorist attacks on 9/11; --Goodwill amortization of $25MM pre-tax ($19MM after-tax) in 3Q `01. Due to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 in 2002, no goodwill amortization occurred in 3Q '02; and, --A 3Q '02 net pre-tax benefit of $2MM ($1MM after-tax) at AEB primarily reflecting adjustments to last year's aggregate restructuring charge reserve. - Negatively impacting this years' comparison was: --A $44MM ($29MM after-tax) increase in expenses at AEFA from a net negative DAC adjustment. - Other items included in this years' comparison were: --The final Lehman Brothers preferred dividend of $23MM ($20MM after-tax), which was offset by business building initiatives; and, --Net pretax gains of $9MM ($6MM after-tax) versus $29MM ($19MM after-tax) in 3Q '01 related to the securitization of U.S. lending receivables, which for "managed" reporting purposes are assumed to be offset by higher marketing and promotion costs and other operating expenses. o The Company reiterated its guidance from 2Q `02's earnings release that based on current conditions, it plans to have less of its funding cost, credit and reengineering benefits fall to the bottom line and plans to invest more in growth initiatives during the remainder of 2002. As a result, full year 2002 EPS is likely not to exceed $2.01. The increase in planned marketing and promotion spending should improve business metrics starting late this year and into 2003. o Compared with the third quarter of 2001: - Worldwide billed business increased 7% on relatively strong consumer spending, and improvements in both small business and corporate spending comparisons to last year's depressed levels. - TRS' worldwide lending balances on a managed asset basis of $37.0B were up 6%; - Worldwide cards in force increased 3%, up 1.5MM from last year; and, - AEFA assets owned, managed and administered of $222B were down 5% vs. last year on asset depreciation and, to a lesser extent, net asset outflows. o Additional items of note included: - While weakness persisted within travel and entertainment related spending by corporations, consumer spending comparisons remained relatively strong, increasing 10% versus last year in the U.S. on 11% higher transaction volume. - Marketing and promotion costs at TRS increased 31% on a managed basis and 25% on a GAAP basis versus 3Q '01, and 24% and 8%, respectively, versus 2Q `02 as more proactive business building activities were implemented. - Lower funding costs provided substantial benefits through improved spreads and a 33% reduction in charge card interest expense. - Card credit quality remained well controlled and reserve coverage ratios remained strong. - AEFA's gross cash sales from all products increased 22% with improvements in retail and institutional sales. - The Company's reengineering initiatives continued to provide substantial year over year expense comparison benefits. Compared with 12/31/00, the total employee count is down 13,800, or 16%. - - The presentation of the Consolidated and TRS GAAP revenues was revised in 1Q `02 to better highlight the impact of securitizations through the reclassification of the related effects from lending finance charge and other revenues to a separate Securitization Income line item. This presentation revision does not impact total GAAP revenues or the TRS managed basis statements of income. Restated information for the past three years was filed with the SEC concurrent with distribution of the 1Q `02 earnings release. All prior period information contained within the 3Q `02 earnings release and earnings supplement has been restated to conform with this presentation. -1-

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2002 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED (unaudited) # Denotes variance in excess of 100%. o CONSOLIDATED REVENUES: Net revenues increased due to greater discount revenues, higher lending spreads and loan balances, larger insurance revenues, and higher revenues related to AEFA's investment portfolio. These items were partially offset by weaker travel revenues and lower management and distribution fees. - Since September 11th, the company incurred costs of approximately $169MM, which are expected to be substantially covered by insurance and, consequently, did not impact results. These costs include the duplicate facilities and equipment associated with the relocation of the company's offices in lower Manhattan and certain other business recovery expenses. Costs associated with the damage to the company's offices, extra operating expenses and business interruption losses are still being evaluated. As of September 2002, the amount above includes approximately $54MM of such costs relating to the company's portion of the repair of its headquarters building. o CONSOLIDATED EXPENSES (MANAGED BASIS): Increased 1%, excluding last year's restructuring and disaster recovery charges, due to lower charge card funding costs, a decline in human resource expenses, reduced provision costs and the benefits of other reengineering activities and expense control initiatives. These decreases were more than offset by higher other operating expenses and increased marketing costs. o SHARE REPURCHASES: The share repurchase program resumed in June, after being suspended at the end of 2Q '01. During 3Q '02, 13.2MM shares were repurchased. Since the inception of repurchase programs in September 1994, 373.0MM shares have been acquired under Board authorizations to repurchase up to 420MM shares. CORPORATE AND OTHER o The net expense of $43MM in 3Q `02 compared with $52MM in 3Q `01 and $45MM in 2Q `02. - 3Q '02 includes the final Lehman Brothers preferred dividend of $23MM ($20MM after-tax), based on Lehman's results for the six months ended 5/31/02. This dividend was offset by business building initiatives. - 3Q '01 included $11MM ($7MM after-tax) of restructuring charges. -3-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2002 OVERVIEW TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES # Denotes variance in excess of 100%. Note: Unless indicated otherwise, the following discussion addresses the "managed basis" Statements of Income. The GAAP Statements of Income are also included in the Company's Earnings Release. o Net income more than doubled on a reported basis. Excluding the 2001 restructuring charges and 9/11 related disaster recovery costs and waived fees from customers, net income increased 28%. o Net revenues rose 5% as higher discount revenue, net card fees, net finance charge revenues and other revenues were partially offset by lower travel and TC related revenues. o Excluding last year's restructuring and disaster recovery charges, expenses were flat as reduced charge card funding costs, lower human resource expenses and expense control initiatives were offset by increased marketing expenses and higher business building and loyalty related costs. o Under SFAS No. 140, which prescribes the accounting for securitizations, TRS recognized net pre-tax gains of $9MM ($6MM after-tax) in 3Q '02 and $29MM ($19MM after-tax) in 3Q '01 related to U.S. Lending receivable securitization activity. In 3Q '02, this activity related to new securitizations of $1.8B and a maturity of $2.0B of prior securitizations, while $0.7B was securitized in 3Q `01. The above Managed Basis Statements of Income assume that the net gains were offset by higher marketing and promotion costs ($5MM in 3Q '02 and $16MM in 3Q `01) and other operating expenses ($4MM in 3Q '02 and $13MM in $3Q `01) and, accordingly, the incremental expenses, as well as the gains, have been eliminated. o The pretax margin was 17.1% in 3Q `02 versus 17.7% in 2Q `02 and 7.1% in 3Q '01 (13.2% excluding the restructuring and disaster recovery charges). o The effective tax rate was 31% in 3Q `02 and 2Q `02 versus 22% in 3Q `01. The rate variance versus last year reflects the relative size of the Travelers Cheque tax benefit contribution during each quarter. -4-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2002 OVERVIEW TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES (Cont'd) o DISCOUNT REVENUE: A 7% increase in billed business and a lower discount rate yielded a 5% increase in discount revenue. - The average discount rate was 2.63% in 3Q `02 versus 2.65% in 2Q `02 and 2.67% in 3Q `01. The decline reflects the cumulative impact of stronger than average growth in the lower rate retail and other "everyday spend" merchant categories (e.g., supermarkets, discounters, etc.), -- We believe the AXP value proposition is strong. However, as indicated in prior quarters, continued changes in the mix of business, volume related pricing discounts, and selective repricing initiatives will probably result in some rate erosion over time. (a) Proprietary card activity only. (b) At September 30 2002, 1.5MM of Canadian lending cards previously classified as "supplemental cards" were included in basic cards in force, as they were issued under a stand-alone offer. The impact on 3Q '01 reported results would be to increase basic cards in force outside the U.S. to 16.6MM and decrease spending per basic card in force worldwide to $1,792 and outside the U.S. to $1,289. The reported growth rates are calculated assuming the additional cards were included in both periods. - BILLED BUSINESS: The 7% increase in billed business resulted from growth in cards in force and higher spending per basic cardmember worldwide. Generally weak economic conditions during the quarter continued to drive a lower relative level of spending within the travel related categories. -- U.S. billed business was up 7% reflecting growth of 10% within the consumer card business, on 11% higher transaction volume, 5% in small business services and 2% within Corporate Services. - Spending per basic card in force increased 8% reflecting growth in billed business and lower basic cards in force. -- Excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation: - Total billed business outside the U.S. was up 5% reflecting double-digit improvement in Asia and Canada, and single digit improvement in Europe, partially offset by a high single-digit decline in Latin America. - Spending per proprietary basic card in force outside the U.S. was flat as higher billed business was offset by the dilutive effect of strong card growth over recent years. (b) -- Network partnership and Purchasing Card volumes sustained their relatively stronger growth performance during the quarter. -- U.S. non-T&E related volume categories (which represented approximately 62% of 3Q `02 U.S. billed business) continued to grow, increasing 11%, while T&E volumes increased 2%. During July and August, T&E related volume fell 6% and 5%, respectively vs. 2001, while in September, it grew 21% due to the substantial effect of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on volume last year. -- Airline related volume, which represented approximately 13% of total U.S. volumes during the quarter, was flat worldwide as the average airline charge decreased 4%, while transaction volume increased 5%. - CARDS IN FORCE worldwide rose 3% versus last year. -- U.S. cards in force were flat with 2Q `02 reflecting the impact of more selective consumer card and small business services acquisition activities during the past year in light of weakening economic conditions, as well as corporate client staff reductions. -- Outside the United States, 400K cards in force were added during the quarter on continued proprietary and network card growth, although proprietary card growth slowed reflecting attrition due to adverse business conditions in Argentina, Brazil and Hong Kong. -5-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2002 OVERVIEW TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES (Cont'd) o NET CARD FEES: Rose 4% due to higher cards in force, fee increases on some products, and a shift in the mix of products. The average fee per card in force was $34 in 3Q '02, 2Q '02 and 3Q `01. o NET FINANCE CHARGE REVENUE: Rose 10% on 4% growth in average worldwide lending balances. - The yield on the U.S. portfolio was 9.7% in 3Q `02 versus 9.8% in 2Q '02 and 8.8% in 3Q '01. The improvement versus last year reflects a decrease in the proportion of the portfolio on introductory rates and the benefits of lower funding costs, which were partially offset by the evolving mix of products toward more lower-rate offerings. o TRAVEL COMMISSIONS AND FEES: Declined 4% on a 7% contraction in travel sales reflecting the continued effects of the weak corporate travel environment. Travel sales increased 5% during September versus last year's particularly depressed level. The revenue earned per dollar of sales was up (9.3% in 3Q `02 versus 8.7% in 2Q `02 and 9.2% in 3Q `01) as new fees related to the migration to transaction-based customer relationships were partially offset by continued efforts by airlines to reduce distribution costs and by corporate clients to contain travel and entertainment expenses. o TC INVESTMENT INCOME: Decreased 6% as a higher average investment was offset by a decline in the pretax yield. TC sales declined 6% in the quarter. o OTHER REVENUES: Increased 4% as larger insurance premiums were partially offset by significantly lower interest income on investment and liquidity pools held within card funding vehicles. o MARKETING AND PROMOTION EXPENSES: Increased 31% on the continuation of the new brand advertising campaign, the introduction of the new charge cards with MEMBERSHIP REWARDS built-in and the Cash Rebate card, more loyalty marketing and a step-up in selected card acquisition activities. o CHARGE CARD INTEREST EXPENSE: Was down 33% due to a lower effective cost of funds and lower receivable balances. o HUMAN RESOURCE EXPENSES: Decreased 12% versus last year as a result of a lower number of employees reflecting reengineering activities, including our technology outsourcing agreement with IBM. - The employee count at 9/02 of 63,200 was down approximately 11,300, or 15%, versus last year. o OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES: Increased 15% reflecting higher costs related to cardmember loyalty programs, as well as the impact of the IBM agreement. These increases were partially offset by reengineering initiatives and cost containment efforts. -6-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2002 OVERVIEW TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES (Cont'd) o CREDIT QUALITY: - Overall credit quality improved during the quarter. - The provision for losses on charge card products decreased 32% on improved past due levels. - The lending provision for losses was 6% above last year on growth in outstanding loans and increased reserve coverage levels. - Reserve coverage ratios, which are well in excess of 100% of past due balances, remained strong. - WORLDWIDE CHARGE CARD: -- The write-off rate decreased from last year and was flat versus last quarter. Past due rates declined versus last year and last quarter. - U.S. LENDING: -- The write-off rate was flat with last year, but improved versus last quarter. Past due levels were flat with last year, but up versus last quarter. -7-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2002 OVERVIEW AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS o Net income increased 5% reflecting the effect last year of the $62MM ($41MM after-tax) of restructuring charges and $11MM ($8MM after-tax) of disaster recovery costs related to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. - Excluding these charges, net income decreased 21% as weak revenue conditions persisted and other operating expenses grew substantially, primarily due to a $44MM ($29MM after-tax) negative net DAC adjustment during the quarter. o Net revenues decreased due to: - Reduced management fees from lower average managed asset levels; and - Higher provisions reflecting greater inforce levels; partially offset by - Higher investment income; and - Higher insurance premiums and advice services fees. o The pretax margin was 22.8% in 3Q '02, 22.6% in 2Q '02 and 21.4% in 3Q '01 (29.4% excluding the restructuring and disaster recovery charges). o The effective tax rate was 25.9% in 3Q '02, 27.9% in 2Q '02 and 25.2% in 3Q `01. o Assets Owned, Managed and Administered: -8-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2002 OVERVIEW AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS (Cont'd) o ASSET QUALITY: - Overall credit quality reflected the persistently high default rates, particularly within the high yield sector. - Non-performing assets relative to invested assets were 0.4% and were 93% covered by reserves, including those related to the impairment of securities. - High-yield investments totaled $2.2B, or 6% of the total investment portfolio, at 9/30/02, up from $1.4B, or 4%, at 9/30/01, and flat with 6% at 6/30/02. Going forward, AEFA continues to target a level of approximately 7%. - The SFAS No. 115 related mark-to-market adjustment on the portfolio (reported in assets pretax) was appreciation of $1.1B at 9/02, $462MM at 6/02, and $717MM at 9/01. o INVESTMENT INCOME: - Investment income increased 6% as higher invested assets more than offset a lower average yield. Results also benefited from the effect of depreciation in the S&P 500 on the value of options hedging outstanding stock market certificates and equity indexed annuities, which was offset in the related provisions. Investment losses, primarily related to high yield and structured investments, were offset by realized gains during the quarter. - Average invested assets of $38.5B (excluding unrealized appreciation/depreciation) rose 14% versus $33.9B in 3Q `01. - The average yield on invested assets declined to 5.7% versus 6.7% in 3Q '01, reflecting a relatively high level of short-term holdings during 3Q '02 and lower new investment yields. - Excluding the impact of income adjustments on the high-yield structured investments, underlying net interest spreads within the insurance and annuity products were down versus last year and last quarter, while certificates were up versus last year, but down versus last quarter. o MANAGEMENT AND DISTRIBUTION FEES: The decrease of 7% was due to lower average assets under management, reflecting the negative impact of weak equity market conditions and, to a lesser extent, net outflows. Distribution fees were up versus last year on higher sales levels. - ASSETS MANAGED: -- The decline in managed assets since 9/01 resulted from $14.4B of market depreciation and $5.1B of net outflows. -- The $17.0B decrease in managed assets during 3Q `02 resulted from market depreciation of $14.2B and net outflows of $2.8B. -9-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2002 OVERVIEW AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS (Cont'd) o PRODUCT SALES: - Total gross cash sales from all products were up 22% versus 3Q `01 with sales improvement within both the retail and institutional channels. Branded advisor-generated sales increased 9% on a cash basis and 8% as measured on the internally used "gross dealer concession basis", which weights the sales of various products to reflect their individual profitability dynamics. - Mutual fund sales increased 4% as proprietary fund sales declined, while non-proprietary sales increased. A significant portion of non-proprietary sales continued to occur in "wrap" accounts. Within proprietary funds: -- Sales of bond funds increased, while equity and money market funds declined. -- Redemption rates continued to compare favorably with industry levels. - Annuity sales more than doubled, on strong growth in both fixed and variable annuity sales. - Sales of insurance products fell 15% reflecting lower sales of life products, partially offset by higher property-casualty sales in part due to sales through Costco. - Certificate sales increased 38% reflecting improvement in both advisor sales and sales of certificates sold to clients outside the U.S. through a joint venture between AEFA and AEB. - Institutional sales increased 60%, reflecting higher new account additions this year and relatively lower sales last year. - Other sales increased 26% due primarily to higher limited partnership sales. - Advisor product sales generated through financial planning and advice services were 73% of total sales in 3Q '02 and in 2Q '02, and 72% in 3Q `01. O OTHER REVENUES: Were up 4%, primarily on higher property-casualty and life insurance premiums and charges, and increased advice services fees. - Financial planning and advice services fees of $27MM rose 19% versus 3Q `01. O PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES AND BENEFITS: Annuity product provisions increased due to a higher inforce level and the effect of depreciation in the S&P 500 on equity indexed annuities, partially offset by lower accrual rates. Insurance provisions increased as higher inforce levels were partially offset by lower accrual rates. Certificate provisions decreased, despite higher inforce levels and the effect on the stock market certificate product provision of depreciation in the S&P 500, due to significantly lower accrual rates. o HUMAN RESOURCES: Expenses declined 3% reflecting higher field force compensation-related costs that were more than offset by the benefits of reengineering and cost containment initiatives within the home office, where average employees were down 14%. - TOTAL ADVISOR FORCE: 11,353 at 9/02; down 32 advisors versus 9/01 and down 7 advisors versus 6/02. -- The decrease in advisors versus 9/01 reflects higher termination rates due to the continuing weak environment and proactive efforts to eliminate unproductive advisors. -- We expect to continue to carefully manage new advisor additions until the environment turns more positive, to ensure overall field force costs are appropriately controlled and advisor production is maximized. -- Veteran advisor retention rates remain strong. -- Total production and advisor productivity were up versus last year, while client acquisitions decreased. -- The total number of clients was up 3% and accounts per client were flat. Client retention exceeded 95%. -10-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2002 OVERVIEW AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS (Cont'd) o OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES: Increased 40% versus last year due to a DAC adjustment, the impact of our technology outsourcing agreement with IBM, and a higher minority interest expense related to premium deposits (the joint venture with AEB). - During the quarter, AEFA completed a comprehensive review of its DAC related practices. This review, which included benchmarking assistance from an industry specialist, analyzed various historical AEFA DAC dynamics in addition to the industry benchmarks. The specific areas reviewed included costs deferred, reversion to mean assumptions, DAC amortization periods, mortality rates and product persistency. As a result of this review, AEFA made certain revisions related to DAC that resulted in a net $44MM increase in expenses this quarter. This net expense increase reflected revisions within three key drivers of DAC expense: -- The most substantial impact, resulting in the acceleration of DAC amortization, was AEFA's revision downward of its customer asset value growth rate assumptions for variable annuity and variable life products to anticipate near-term and long-term market returns at a level consistent with the long-term historical averages. The customer asset value growth rate assumptions, which include the reversion to mean assumptions, were adjusted down to 7%. While this growth level is consistent with the prior long-term assumption, it is approximately half of the prior near-term assumption. -- AEFA also revised its assumptions involving DAC amortization periods, predominantly on fixed annuities, to better reflect actual experience and future expectations. This resulted in a substantial decrease in DAC amortization during the quarter. -- Finally, AEFA revised the types and amounts of costs deferred, in part, to reflect the impact of advisor platform changes and the effects of related reengineering. This resulted in an increase in expense recognized during the quarter, which represented approximately half of the combined DAC-related increase. While the first two revisions should reduce adverse DAC expense volatility risk going forward, the third revision will increase somewhat ongoing expenses, although these additional expenses should be offset to some extent as reengineering and other cost control initiatives are expected to mitigate their impact. -11-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2002 OVERVIEW AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK (preliminary) STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (unaudited) # Denotes variance in excess of 100%. o Net income increased, in part, as a result of last years' $84MM ($57MM after-tax) restructuring charge. - 3Q '02 includes a net pretax benefit of $2MM ($1MM after-tax) reflecting an adjustment to last year's restructuring charge reserve of $6MM ($3MM after-tax), which was partially offset by a 3Q '02 restructuring charge of $4MM ($2MM after-tax) reflecting the Bank's efforts to further rationalize certain operations. - Excluding the effect of the restructuring charges, net income increased 67%. o In 3Q '02, the Bank completed the purchase of the remaining 50% of its Brazil joint venture, Banco Inter American Express, which is consolidated in the current period's results. o Net revenues grew 21% on higher net interest income and other revenues. - Net interest income rose 25% primarily due to lower funding costs. - Commissions and fees were up 7% from growth in loan acquisitions in the Personal Financial Services (PFS) business and greater non-credit transactions in the Financial Institutions Group, which were partially offset by lower results in Corporate Banking. - Foreign exchange income and other revenue increased 32% on higher revenue from lower funding costs within premium deposits (the joint venture with AEFA). Foreign currency-related revenues were lower than a year ago. o Human resource and other operating expenses combined were down reflecting reduced costs related to reengineering activities and tighter expense controls. o The provision for losses increased mainly due to higher bankruptcy related write-offs in the consumer lending portfolio in Hong Kong. o AEB remained "well-capitalized". -12-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2002 OVERVIEW AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK (Cont'd) o EXPOSURES - AEB's loans outstanding were $5.5B at 9/02 versus $5.6B at 9/01 and 6/02. Activity since 9/01 included an $800MM decrease in corporate banking loans, a $100MM increase in financial institution loans and $600MM increase in consumer and private banking loans. Consumer and private banking loans comprised 66% of total loans at 9/02 and at 6/02, and 55% at 9/01; corporate banking loans comprised 9% of total loans at 9/02 and at 6/02, and 22% at 9/01; and financial institution loans comprised 25% of total loans at 9/02 and at 6/02, and 23% at 9/01. - In addition to the loan portfolio, there are other banking activities, such as forward contracts, various contingencies and market placements, which added approximately $7.2B to the credit exposures at 9/02, $7.4B at 6/02 and $8.0B at 9/01. Of the $7.2B of additional exposures at 9/02, $5.0B were relatively less risky cash and securities related balances. (1)Includes cash, placements and securities. (2)Individual items may not add to totals due to rounding. (3)Total exposures to Argentina at 9/30/02 were $37MM, which includes loans of $25MM, compared to 6/30/02 exposures of $42MM, including $28MM of loans. Note: Includes cross-border and local exposure and does not net local funding or liabilities against any local exposure. -13-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2002 OVERVIEW AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK (Cont'd) o Total non-performing loans* of $120MM decreased from $121MM at 6/02 and $133MM at 9/01 as AEB continues to wind down its Corporate Banking business. The decreases reflect loan payments and write-offs, mostly in Egypt and India, partially offset by net downgrades. o Other non-performing assets were $17MM at 9/02 versus $2MM at 6/02 and 9/01 on the inclusion of certain derivatives activities related to Argentina. o AEB's total reserves at 9/02 of $166MM compared with $160MM at 6/02 and $149MM at 9/01, and are allocated as follows: - Loan loss reserve coverage of non-performing loans of 129% at 9/02 compared with 127% at 6/02 and 108% at 9/01. o Management formally reviews the loan portfolio and evaluates credit risk throughout the year. This evaluation takes into consideration the financial condition of the borrowers, fair market value of collateral, status of delinquencies, historical loss experience, industry trends and the impact of current economic conditions. As of September 30, 2002, management considers the loss reserve to be appropriate. * AEB defines a non-performing loan as any loan (other than certain smaller-balance consumer loans) on which the accrual of interest is discontinued because the contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or if, in management's opinion, the borrower is unlikely to meet its contractual obligations. For smaller-balance consumer loans related to the PFS business, management establishes reserves it believes to be adequate to absorb credit losses in the portfolio. Generally, these loans are written off in full when an impairment is determined or when the loan becomes 120 or 180 days past due, depending on loan type. For this portfolio, 30-day past due rates were 4.9% at 9/02, as compared to 4.6% at 6/02 and 5.2% at 9/01. -14-
