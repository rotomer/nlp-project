This represents approximately nine percent of the 1.3 billion common shares outstanding at October 31, 2002. This authorization is a continuation of the company's share repurchase program, which began in September 1994. Prior to today's announcement, the board had authorized repurchases totaling 450 million shares, including purchases made under agreements with third parties. As of October 31, 2002, the company had repurchased a total of 379 million shares. The company believes that utilizing excess capital to repurchase shares in the open market represents an effective means of building shareholder value. Separately, the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.08 per common share, payable February 10, 2003, to shareholders of record on January 3, 2003.
