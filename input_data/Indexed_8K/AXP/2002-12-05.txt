Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure. In the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, dated November 7, 2002, which contained a presentation made at the Forrester Research Executive Strategy Forum, it was stated that on a worldwide basis, cardmembers have enrolled almost 10 million American Express cards in the Company's online account service, and that online enrollment represented almost 18% of the Company's global card base, including consumer, corporate and small business cardmembers. Upon further review of the underlying data, the Company now believes that the numbers reported should have been approximately 8 million cards enrolled in the online account service, representing approximately 15% of the Company's global card base. This change does not affect any other data that was cited in the presentation.
