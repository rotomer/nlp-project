EXHIBIT 99.6 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FINANCIAL COMMUNITY PRESENTATION TED TRUSCOTT REMARKS FEBRUARY 5, 2003 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- o Thank you, Barbara. o As Jim mentioned, our Building Blocks for Growth strategy has four main components and my work as Chief Investment Officer is directly linked to the More Enhanced Capabilities and Processes and More Effective Organization blocks. o I'd like to update you on the progress we have made and the steps taken to improve investment performance. o We have significantly moved the performance dial in the right direction in the equity categories and have more work to do in fixed income. o We can see the positive impact of our efforts each month that our portfolios outperform their Lipper peer groups. As poor performing months roll off, we are seeing improved performance in 1-year numbers and in some cases 3- and 5-year numbers. o The team brought me to AEFA in September of 2001 to help build a world class asset management organization. o I was attracted to AEFA by the strong brand, tremendous distribution capabilities, and the opportunity to grow the financial services and asset management business of American Express. o The AEFA senior leadership team is committed to improving performance and efforts were already underway before I arrived. o Jim had hired a VP of Risk Management and launched an internal initiative known as World Class Asset Management and Insurance, which addressed key gaps in our asset management business and suggested solutions to fill those gaps. Organizational support was therefore in place to make changes especially in the area of talent since many key portfolios were underperforming both benchmarks and Lipper peer groups. o We are operating against a three-part strategy - o Attract new talent, build around existing talent; o Improve our hub operations, and o Expansion. o We have largely completed the talent building and acquisition component and our immediate focus is on improving operations. o We believe that there are diseconomies of scale in this business. In fact, one of the great paradoxes of the industry is that investment management firms with small resources, also known as boutiques, can outperform larger shops with much higher levels of resources. o At the same time, we also know that this is largely a scale business where leverage is obtained by managing more assets with a largely fixed amount of cost, mostly in the form of people and technology. o In the equity world, we decided to have the best of both worlds and operate like a boutique while managing a large amount of assets. o As such, we have largely decentralized our equity investment management capabilities and established geographic diversity with investment satellite offices in Boston, Cambridge, New York, San Diego and London. o Satellite offices are staffed with highly talented portfolio managers and dedicated analysts. Each office is responsible for a product or group of products with performance as the key deliverable. This is how we created the boutique atmosphere of mutual accountability within a large firm. o Our headquarters remains in Minneapolis with many scalable activities such as compliance and operations. Our commitment to research excellence is enhanced by the dedicated Minneapolis central research facility. o We have a disciplined investment approach through assigned benchmarks and risk parameters to ensure investments are performance driven and deliver on our client expectations. o We are experienced. We have delivered on our clients' investment needs through all market conditions for over 100 years. o This brings me to talent. o We have had challenges in investment performance but we have also had pockets of good investment talent and performance especially Gordon Fines and his team. o As part of our strategy to decentralize our equity operations, we established a San Diego boutique led by Gordon to run our Growth Spectrum product offerings in the institutional world and continue the strong performance of AXP(R) NEW DIMENSIONS FUND(R). o Gordon is joined by Duncan Evered and Paul Rokosz who co-manage the four star AXP Equity Select Fund. * o We made Duncan sole portfolio manager on AXP Equity Select Fund and named Paul portfolio manager on AXP Strategy Aggressive Fund on July 1, 2002. o The strong performance of the San Diego boutique is evident when you look at their results. o In addition to establishing the San Diego office, we created a satellite office in Boston when we hired three top portfolio managers from Fidelity o Doug Chase o Nick Thakore o Bob Ewing o These are seasoned managers with successful track records who ran: o Fidelity Export and Multinational (Chase) o Fidelity Fund (Thakore) o Fidelity Balanced - equity portion (Ewing) o Since we established our Boston Office, we have seen tremendous short-term results across the three large cap styles they manage - Growth, Core, and Value. For instance, AXP Growth Fund's 1-year performance places it in the top quartile for Large Cap Growth portfolios. o I would like to share with you the performance rankings for the portfolios they began managing on April 1, 2002 as well as for two new funds that we launched, AXP Large Cap Equity Fund and AXP Large Cap Value Fund o But as you know NASD rules forbid presenting less than 1-year performance rankings in communications with the public and the circumstances of this meeting including its broad availability via webcast means we are subject to these rules. I can tell you, however, that we are very pleased with their initial results and I look forward to sharing with you their 1-year results later this year. o In our business the best want to work for the best, and therefore, talent attracts talent. We hired top analysts from many competing firms such as Putnam, MFS, and several hedge funds to establish our Boston boutique. Two of the analysts, Nina Hughes and Telis Bertsekas, also manage AXP Global Technology Fund, which at the end of 2002 ranked in the 46th percentile for 1-year performance within its Lipper peer group.** o As these new resources started working together, we saw an immediate culture shift across the firm especially an emphasis on high quality fundamental research. o We expanded our quantitative capabilities by acquiring the asset of Dynamic Ideas, LLC, a quantitative research firm formed by Dr. Dimitris Bertsimas, the Boeing Professor of Operations Research at MIT. o Dr. Bertsimas was a key consultant to well respected firms including Grantham, Mayo & Von Otterloo, and he and his team have begun working on asset allocation models. They will use these proprietary models and optimization techniques to run the equity portion of AXP Managed Allocation Fund, a new fund - AXP Quantitative Large Cap Equity Fund, and managed accounts. o We hired Michelle Keeley from Zurich to run our fixed income department. Michelle has since enhanced her talent base by attracting individuals like Tom Murphy from BlackRock to run Investment Grade Corporates and Jerri Cohen from Scudder to manage our cash portfolios. o We have restructured our international boutique in London with the leadership of Mark Burgess. o We have restructured and improved a smaller but more effective central research department, under the leadership of Tom Mahowald, which is designed to support the efforts of our boutiques. o As head of fixed income, Michelle Keeley leads our owned asset organization. o We hold a high quality portfolio, consistent with our goals of diversification, liquidity and high credit quality. o In 2002, we had a strong year given this low risk profile. o We transitioned risk from credit to cash flow as the credit environment deteriorated. This insulated the portfolio from credit shocks as defaults climbed to historic highs and spreads widened. o Our overarching goal is consistent, superior investment results over time. And we have to have clear goals to adequately judge performance. o At any point in time, we want 60-70% of our portfolios and assets above median as compared to their Lipper peer groups with no more than 15% in the fourth quartile. Fourth quartile performance is a key dissatisfier for our clients. o We re-assigned every problem equity portfolio at AEFA in the last year. o The trends are what we want - more of our portfolios and assets are above median. o We clearly could not have moved the numbers if we had not had significant performance improvements in the portfolios where we changed managers or processes last year. o We ended 2002 with 69% of equity mutual fund assets in portfolios that were above median, compared to 50% at the end of 2001.** o When looking at performance in terms of portfolios, the percentage above median rose from 26% at the end of 2001 to 44% at the end of 2002.** o We significantly reduced the number of portfolios in the fourth quartile - only 11% of our portfolios on an asset weighted basis, down from 34% in 2001.** o This trend is also reflected on an equal weighted basis. In one year, we reduced the number of portfolios in the 4th quartile from 57% at the end of 2001 to 18% at the end of 2002.** o While we are pleased with these results, we recognize that achieving investment performance is difficult. Markets are variable and can work against you. It takes time to change a track record. o We are not meeting our fixed income performance goals, but in fixed income, the spreads between the best performing and worst performing portfolios in a particular category are often smaller than in equities. o Similar to what we did on the equity side, Michelle Keeley recently announced the revamping of our fixed income operational structure. o We are moving to a fixed income organizational model that leverages team-based, sector-specific leadership - similar to the structure of leading fixed income asset managers like BlackRock or Pimco. o American Express has taken the stance that we will invest in our asset management business during this difficult period in the market and emerge stronger when markets rebound. o In 2003, we will invest in upgrading technology and further building our infrastructure, which is part of stage II of our strategy to improve hub operations. o Our early results are gaining attention from Morningstar, media, and our advisors. o I am confident we will continue to improve investment performance in 2003, based on the following: o Equity managers who took over portfolios in 2002 will have reached their individual 1-year performance; o Our San Diego and Cambridge offices, as well as central research will be fully operational; o Fixed income will have the benefit of operating under sector-specific leadership teams and o Technology support capabilities will be upgraded. o I hope I have been able to give you an overview of our initiatives and insights into what we intend to do going forward. o I'll turn it back to Jim and would be happy to answer any questions when we reach the question and answer portion of the meeting.

EXHIBIT 99.4 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FINANCIAL COMMUNITY PRESENTATION BARRY MURPHY REMARKS FEBRUARY 5, 2003 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- o Thanks Jim, I want to dig a little deeper into Jim's comments and let you know where and how I'm driving our retail focus. o First, let me tell you where we're not going. o I'm a member of the SIA Board. At one end of the table are direct firms, Fidelity, Schwab, and Ameritrade. o The online revolution is now over and those firms are reinventing themselves through advice. o At the other end of the table are the full service brokerage firms, e.g., Merrill, Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley. They're trying to move away from a transactional culture and business model. o The insurance companies in the room are struggling to move beyond insurance. o We're in the optimal place: Deep into advice, not dependent on online trading, and not involved with investment banking. o That's where we want to stay. we want 3 things: o Stay true to our mission. o Build on our Core Competence o Push our model towards accelerated growth. o How are we going to do that? By focusing on o Advisor growth o Client acquisition o Advisor Productivity o As Jim pointed out, AEFA is in a highly regulated industry and we take our compliance obligations very seriously. We want to make sure that our transactions are suitable, our sales practices are appropriate and our advice is in the best interest of the clients. o Our mission has remained the same over the past 20 years: "to help clients achieve their financial objectives, prudently and thoughtfully, through a long-term relationship based on trusted, knowledgeable advice." o And our core competence is: advice and planning o Is this style of business going out of style? Quite the contrary. o Demand for advice is strong and increasing. o Recent research indicates consumers are moving away from self-directed investments. They are looking for advice and validation of their decisions. o Your next "hot stock tip" has taken a back seat to your personal concerns and goals. o Our model makes sense to clients and works for shareholders. How? o Financial planning produces product diversity, persistency, and low client attrition o 39% of our clients have completed a financial plan with us. o If they have $100k-500 thousand invested with us, 63% have a plan. o If they have more than $500 thousand invested with us , 74% have a plan. o Planning clients buy more products. o When a client does a plan, they open an average of 7 accounts compared to non-planning clients who open 2.6 accounts o When a client does a plan, they stay with us longer. 74% of our planning clients stay with us at least 10 years. o 73% of our 2002 sales came from clients with a financial plan. o The model works. The question is "is there room to grow and how are we going to grow?" Let me first address the issue of advisor growth. o American Express has the 4th largest number of advisors. o The data is our estimation based on available public information. o Merrill Lynch now has about 14 thousand financial consultants down from 16 thousand. o Morgan Stanley has about 13 thousand 5 hundred o Smith Barney - about 12 thousand seven hundred o AEFA has 11,689 advisors across our 3 platforms, o Our clients per advisor ratio is approximately 250 clients per advisor - which is below the wirehouses. o For assets, the AEFA average is $71 thousand per client . o With this distribution model, AEFA is quite profitable. Why? As Jim said: o Assets are persistent and very diverse and client attrition is low. o P2 Advisor expenses are low. Don't forget, P2 advisors pay for all rent, computers, staff, etc., that support their practices. o So, you can see our growth potential. o As Jim mentioned, we've made a lot of progress evolving our advisor platforms to improve their economics, lower attrition, and increase productivity. o Our advisors split across 3 platforms with approximately: o 23% in P1, Branded employees o 65% in P2, Branded franchisees o 12% in P3, Unbranded, independent o Together, we think our advisor value proposition is extremely strong. o In P2, You can be an entrepreneur. You can work on your own or as part of a large group practice. You can work in a downtown branch or a small rural community. o Though on your own, you get a brand connection, we are not a transaction factory. We offer shared values, consumer appeal, extensive training and a focus on Financial Planning. o The brand value was demonstrated when we rolled out Platforms in 2000. In P1, we hired many eager recruits in 2000, and many of them left for failure to pass the required exams or build a client base. So, we took our net loss in 2001 and fixed the platforms by: o Tightening P1 hiring criteria o Setting higher minimum production standards for P1 o We focused management on driving planning and client acquisition by P1 advisors. o We focused P1 recruiting in the higher demographic areas of the country to leverage infrastructure and hiring opportunities. o Reducing costs in our system. Expenses in US Retail are running below 2000 levels and employee count is down 34% vs. 2000. o Improved the servicing, tools and capabilities we provide to P2 advisors, strengthening the value proposition for our advisors and their tie to the American Express Brand. o Aligned metrics and compensation of advisors and leaders with our key growth levers. o Our actions have paid off. Client acquisition by P1 advisors is up 15% over 2001. Production by P1 advisors is up 18% over 2001. Most impressively, 78% of new P1 clients come in with a comprehensive Financial Plan. In 2003, our focus is to push selective hiring, again. o Our pipeline for new P1 advisors remains very strong. o On average, we have more than 8,000 people applying every month to be a P1 advisor. o That's right. Over 100,000 people came into our offices across the country last year, interested in this career. o Primarily, we attract people who do not have financial services experience. Rather, they are "career changers" (e.g., Lawyers, CPAs, Teachers) who have an entrepreneurial gene and like working with people - - These remain the bread and butter of our recruits o We have 600-900 of them in training at all times. o To leverage this demand for a career as an advisor, we have expanded our options in 2003 to a three-pronged approach covering o traditional P1, o associate advisors in P2, o and the experienced recruit. o P1 will continue to be the main way we bring new advisors on board. o We will continue to refine our selection process by more rigorously assessing up front a candidate's ability to succeed, including passing licensing tests and attracting clients. Greater "selection" success will allow us to shift our management resources to productivity and retention. Historically, our retention rate for advisors who stay with us for 5 or more years is 93% o The associate advisor position is primarily for candidates who are entrepreneurial but not quite ready for full franchise ownership and are looking for a successful P2 advisor franchisee to mentor/coach them and prepare them for franchise ownership. o For the first time, we are allowing P2 advisors to hire associates, perhaps an insurance or brokerage specialist, after we review candidates for legal and compliance suitability. o Attracting experienced recruits with a book of business is NOT a core competency of AEFA. In 2003, we will pilot recruitment of licensed professionals that desire our training, brand and financial planning model. o Can we grow the advisor force? Yes. o We are targeting annual advisor growth of 4 to 5 percent. o As Jim mentioned, two of our key Building Blocks for Growth center on client acquisition and deepening client relationships. Let's start with client acquisition. o Approximately 66% of our new clients come in through advisor generated activity including referrals and local marketing. The corporate office supplements this effort by generating leads for P1 and P2 advisors. o What's not working? Direct mail response rates are down and mailing costs are increasing. o What is working? Our cross sell efforts which focus on leveraging our existing Blue Box, Corporate and cardmember relationships. o There are two specific programs I would like to use as examples. o First, our Financial Education in the Workforce program provides the opportunity to cross-sell between our 401k Client Base and the advisor channel. With 401k Plan Sponsor approval, Advisors present educational seminars in the workplace to clients enrolled in the program. o In 2002, we enhanced activities with our 401(k) clients representing 250 companies and over 1 million participants. We also have financial education relationships with 75 additional major U.S. corporations and 500 smaller companies, representing over 1 million employees. o 17% of AEFA's retail clients in 2002 came from the combination of those institutional relationships. o We plan to deepen and expand this relationship in 2003. o The second example focuses on alliances with major companies to help generate new clients. Our first test in 2002 was with Costco. Costco is one of the largest merchants in the American Express Establishment Services network. o The demographics of the Costco clients are a bit more upscale than you might be thinking. For example, the average household income is about $75 thousand, with a high percentage of members being small business owners. This base is more inclined to planning. o And the results show it: 94% of our AEFA clients through Costco have completed a financial plan. o During this initial launch in 2002, 5% of our total new clients came from the Costco cross-sell program. o Because of this success, we are expanding the Costco alliance this year. o We are working on additional alliances so as to duplicate the Costco success in other industries. o We are also testing targeted offers to Cardmembers including: special offers for members of OPEN: The Small Business Network(SM); for web savvy Cardmembers via our internet site; cash offers through the ONE account; and lending products through Membership Banking. o Bottom line is that we have moved quickly to more than offset the decline in direct mail with aggressive leverage of the Blue Box relationships. o Now, let me turn to some of the things we are doing to increase advisor productivity and deepen client relationships. o As you have seen, the power of financial planning is evident - so is the opportunity for growth and expansion. o With 39% of our clients having a plan, we have a clear opportunity to market within our current client base. o In 2003, we will begin to develop and offer components of a modular advice strategy. We want to attract clients who may be hesitant to do a complete plan and refresh the planning drive with those clients who purchased a plan when they started with us. o For our initial work in modular advice, we will focus on four key areas: o Investments, Retirement, Family Security, Cash o For each area, we will deliver a summarized report that is clear and actionable, backed by supporting data in everyday language. o Specifically for Investments, we're developing a curriculum for our advisors to better serve the upscale market. We've also reached an agreement with Morningstar to provide advanced tools to help advisors to research, monitor, and rebalance investment portfolios. o We will begin introducing these advice modules this year. o Let me describe how this actually works. o Client #1 is a 42 year old financial services executive with 2 school age kids, concerned about job security. She and her advisor have agreed to the following gameplan to refresh her financial plan for 2003. The year starts: o Q1 Stock options Because many of the client's options are underwater, the advisor will deliver a revised, detailed schedule for exercising these options at specific price targets. o Q2 - College for her kids. The client's portfolio has declined 40% since 2000 - The advisor will answer the question whether she needs to adjust her contributions to the "college fund" or consider an alternative solution such as a 529 plan. In addition, the advisor will consider the impact of any changes on the overall plan. o Q3 Aging parents, Advisor will present the pros and cons of contributing to parents from current cash flow vs. purchasing long term care insurance on their behalf. Similarly, the advisor will reevaluate her employee-sponsored life insurance to see if it is adequate for the next 10 years. o Q4 second home in Florida. The advisor will examine whether the client can still plan for a second home or whether she should forget about it. o Client #2 is a 58 year old almost ready to retire corporate executive. He's looking for his advisor to be his "defacto CFO" to help him handle ongoing issues. Cash flow and a retirement income strategy are his first concerns. o Q1: Advisor will present a plan detailing which investments should be tapped in which order to support cash flow needs. o Q2-4 A formal retirement plan will be drafted by the advisor. The advisor will drive the client's implementation of the plan, and coordinate meetings among the client, the client's attorney and his CPA. o That's how it works. The client is buying advice, service and trust. Investment or insurance purchases come over time after that trust is established. o Advice modules comprise just one of the initiatives we are working on to improve advisor productivity. Everything you hear today, from the product improvements Barbara will speak about, to the investment performance improvements Ted will describe -all have the same end goal helping our clients and making our advisors more productive. o Let me summarize and close: o AEFA needs to: o Stay on mission: long term relationships with clients o Build on our core competencies: advice and planning o Push our model towards accelerated growth o We are already quite profitable where we are. We believe we can expand our profitability by accelerating our growth. o More advisors - - I really, really, want to catch those 3 firms ahead of us. o More clients per advisor o More assets per client o Can we push this formula towards more profitable growth? o Absolutely. o Now I'd like to introduce Barbara Fraser, EVP of Products and Corporate Marketing. o Barbara

EXHIBIT 99.3 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FINANCIAL COMMUNITY PRESENTATION JIM CRACCHIOLO REMARKS (PART 1) FEBRUARY 5, 2002 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- o Thank you, Ken. Good afternoon. o Before I begin, I'd like to introduce the members of my Financial Advisors executive team. o First, Barry Murphy, who heads US Retail, o Barbara Fraser, in charge of Products and Marketing, o Ted Truscott, our Chief Investment Officer, o Steve Roszell, who leads our Institutional group, o Rudy Adolf, head of Banking and Brokerage, and, o Walter Berman, our Chief Financial Officer. o After my opening remarks, you will hear from Barry, Barbara and Ted, who will represent the team. [Pause] o So let's begin. o When I updated you on Financial Advisors, 18 months ago, we were dealing with some major issues. o First, the significant challenges caused by a dramatic decline in the equity and credit markets. o And as you all know, that decline has continued and has been worse than any of us expected. o Second, we were feeling the effects of both moving to an open product system and to three new platforms in our retail distribution network, which put pressure on our margins without increasing our productivity. o Over the last 18 months, we made significant progress in dealing with our challenges and fixing many aspects of our core business. o Today, we are now very much focused on repositioning Financial Advisors for future growth. o During the next hour, my team and I will cover three key areas: o First, the progress we have made. o Second, our building blocks for growth. o And, lastly, I'll share our outlook for how our business could perform under various scenarios. o Let's start with the progress we have made. o First, we strengthened our balance sheet. o We reallocated our investment portfolios by reducing high yield from approximately 12% to 6% of our owned assets. o Overall, we exited 2002 with a stronger balance sheet and an unrealized gain position of over $1.1 billion in our owned assets and securities. o Second, we needed to reduce our cost structure to deal with the significant decline in our revenues and margins. o Therefore, we implemented a comprehensive Reengineering program. o This included a 22% reduction in our workforce across the company, as well as a total restructuring of our Field force between 2000 and 2002. o And, we also strengthened our service delivery capabilities and operating effectiveness. o Overall, we realized approximately $400 million+ in pre-tax benefits in the last two years. o A significant portion of these savings was reinvested in the business to fund core infrastructure upgrades, key capabilities and product expansion to position us for growth. o Next, we had to modify our Advisor Platforms after their initial introduction to improve their economics, stem attrition in the P1 employee channel, and increase productivity across the system. o We ended 2002 with a turnaround in our advisor count moving to a net gain of 154 advisors. This is at a time when many of our competitors' field forces were shrinking - - - some dramatically. o For our P1 employee group, production and client acquisition have now reached their highest levels since platforms were introduced. o And, in our P2 platform, our most tenured advisors, advisor satisfaction is up and retention remains quite high at 91%. o As a result, last year our production, or gross dealer concession sales increased 7%, a real positive for us compared to the industry. o Next, we had to deal with some serious issues with our mutual fund performance, which as you know had negative implications to our entire business. o We strengthened leadership and added top-notch portfolio managers and analysts. o We enhanced capabilities, changed the metrics in evaluating performance, tied compensation to performance, and established satellite offices. o Clearly, our funds need a 3 to 5 year track record, but some of our early results are promising. We ended 2002 with 69% of our equity mutual fund assets on an asset-weighted basis above the median, up from 50% in 2001. * *Source: Lipper. As of 12/31. See footnote ** o The next area we addressed was broadening product depth and scope to better meet client needs. We have been focused on ensuring that our proprietary product is well represented in our advisor network where it currently represents approximately 65% of total sales. o In response to the changing environment and to position ourselves better in an open product system, we launched 34 new products across our asset management, insurance and annuity businesses, a major increase over prior years. o To close gaps we had in style boxes in our mutual fund family, we launched 10 new sub-advised funds in the value, international and small cap categories, partnering with successful fund managers. o These products have attractive economics and have garnered $2.3 billion in net asset flows since program inception. o And, in the annuities area, with the addition of new products as well as new partners in our Third Party Distribution channels, we achieved double-digit sales growth over the last two years. o In fact, we are now the number 3 provider of annuities in the bank channel today, and distribute to banks such as Wachovia, Wells Fargo and Fleet. o In addition to growing our client base through traditional means, such as referrals and local activities, we began utilizing a number of new channels such as workplace, online and corporate alliances. o And, as Ken has discussed, beginning in 2002 we placed a greater emphasis on exploring cross-sell opportunities across the Blue Box, particularly between Financial Advisors and our Cardmember base. o Since my last update, we made good progress testing and learning. o We are now developing sophisticated tools and capabilities to improve targeting and conversion. o And lastly, in the past, we didn't gather a large portion of our clients' assets, including cash. o Last year we started concentrating on capturing more assets, particularly from our best clients. o First, we introduced American Express Platinum Financial Services(R) and trained over 750 of our top advisors. o And, we are seeing some initial success, with existing clients committing an average of $150,000 in new money. This offering is tailored to the upper market with a suite of premium products and services. o And, we also put in place, American Express ONE(SM) Financial Account, an integrated cash management and investment account allowing clients to consolidate all their assets into a single relationship with American Express. o Since the initial rollout, we have acquired $2.2 billion in incremental new assets with an overall average account balance of $306,000. o As you will recall, these were the five major areas I told you we would focus on in my last update. o I have only shared a few of our highlights to give you a sense of how we have been dealing with the challenges, closing some key gaps and building on our foundation. o Overall, we have made very good progress in this period and we executed against our stated priorities against the back drop of a punishing environment. o Capitalizing on their full potential will require a healthier environment and stronger investor confidence. o To put that into context, I looked at the last few years from another perspective, to see how the market environment and some of the actions we have taken have translated to our earnings. o Let's go back to 2000, which was a high water mark on Wall Street. Our earnings power was driven in part by an 8-year bull market, earnings on our owned investments, strong consumer sentiment and some under-investing in select areas of our business. o Since that point, on an absolute basis, Financial Advisors went from $1.0 billion in net income in 2000 to $632 million in 2002, down 39%. o The key driver of this reduction was a 35% decline in the S&P 500. o This resulted in a depreciation in our clients' assets and a reduction in management fees, making up 77% of our earnings decrease. o I think you saw similar effects across the industry. This clearly goes with the territory of running any financial services company today. o Obviously, we can't control the markets. But, there was more going on in this period than just market depreciation. o A portion of the next bar represents actions we took to strengthen our balance sheet such as reallocating the percentage of high yield in our owned investment portfolio. There was, as you know, a significant cost associated with doing this. o In addition, between 2000 and 2002, we also made adjustments to our Deferred Acquisition Cost position. o To help offset these declines during this period, we also generated significant reengineering benefits. o And, we utilized a good portion of these savings to reinvest back in the business to strengthen our core foundation and position us for future growth. o And lastly, the "other" bar represents the net of few additional items across the company, such as weakness in our Institutional business, where we have seen performance related outflows. o Obviously the steps we took had some costs associated with them, but they were necessary, and I believe they set the base for future growth. o We believe that our earnings decrease during this period, after all the items I have covered, was still consistent with what other firms experienced in the industry. o Today the company has solid profitability and a strong balance sheet even in a very weak environment. o This is driven by the strengths of our business model, which I will now highlight. o And, I will tell you how the strategies and initiatives that we have put in place to evolve this model will allow us to grow more expansively for the future. o Today, we like the position we have in Financial Services. o With market momentum no longer a given, clients are becoming more prudent when committing money and they are focusing on satisfying their longer-term goals. o Our model was built around financial planning and advice. It's more relevant today than ever before. Financial planning and advice is the space we have occupied successfully for 20 years. o In fact, many firms are trying to emulate us. They call themselves financial advisors. But in reality many focus on stock trading. o Our advisors have established and built their practices on an individual relationship basis by preparing clients for the long-term. o In building these relationships, we focus on client needs and objectives, products that are suitable depending on a clients' risk profile and goals, and compliance with applicable laws. While my colleagues and I won't be repeating this today, this focus is fundamental to everything we do in the home office and field. o Our core strength and competency is our planning model. o This has been particularly evident during these turbulent times and especially with widespread changes across the industry. o We generate good returns because we have: o Very strong retention among clients with a plan at 94%, o Planning clients who average 7.1 accounts with us, o Excellent asset persistency. As an example, based on redemption rates, our clients hold long-term mutual funds over twice as long on average versus the industry. o And our advisor retention continues to be strong, as I've already mentioned. o To better understand the power of our model, let's look at our financial returns compared to the industry. o There are few firms like Financial Advisors, since we are an asset manager, an insurance and annuity company, as well as a broker dealer. o We analyzed the competitive performance of these three industries between 1992 and 2002. o Broker/Dealers' averaged a return on equity of 19%. o Asset managers generated a 25% return over this period. o And, lastly, the insurance and annuity industry realized a 10% return. o We then took the liberty of creating a similar firm to Financial Advisors for comparative purposes, by using our business segment weightings. o This resulted in an industry composite generating a 15% return on equity. o By comparison, Financial Advisors actually generated an 18% return over the same period. o And, even though our return last year was reduced to 11.6%, our analysis still indicates that that return continues to exceed the industry composite, and now by an even greater amount. o As I indicated, we believe this higher return differential is linked to better advisor retention, higher product persistency, deeper planning relationships with clients, due in large part to the associated effectiveness of our planning model. o Having said that, the full potential of this model has not been realized. o Looking back, we know we could have been more aggressive and opportunistic over the years in taking advantage of our business model. o Looking forward, our challenge is to be more productive, more efficient and more successful in evolving this franchise. o I would now like to highlight 4 significant opportunities we are targeting to expand the business. o First, until now, we primarily served the mass market. o Our clients have, on average $71,000 with us and we can serve them profitably. o However, there is a larger opportunity, and it is even more profitable for us, to focus on the mass affluent, people who have $100-000 - $500,000 of investable assets. o This is a large and growing consumer segment. It's highly underserved, since we believe many of the wire houses that offer personal service are moving toward clients with greater than $1 million in assets. o We already serve clients that have above $100,000 in investable assets. They represent approximately 72% of our assets, even though they are a smaller part of our client base. o We know our brand has a strong appeal here and by enhancing our value propositions to serve more of their needs, we believe we can be even more successful, as early results have shown. o Second, in the past we focused on ensuring we had a strong advisor distribution network and we supported and relied on our advisors to attract and develop clients. We were very much reliant upon sales generated through our advisor channel. o We think we can be even more successful in growing our franchise by surrounding advisors with the marketing muscle of American Express to help create greater client awareness and interest. o By adding the company's world-class marketing expertise and capabilities, we believe we can complement our advisors by attracting more prospects and deepening client relationships even more, especially among the mass affluent. o Third, as you know, financial planning is a core driver of our profitability and what we believe is a key differentiator of our business in the industry. o However, as good as we are at utilizing financial planning with our clients currently, we still only have a 39% penetration of our clients who complete a comprehensive financial plan. o Many prospects and clients find completing a comprehensive plan a bit intimidating and time consuming. o In order to enhance our ability to attract and serve more prospects and clients, we will complement our comprehensive planning with more flexible and modular planning based on life-triggers, such as marriage, birth of a child, inheritance, and retirement. o This will help attract more clients and increase our product sales per client, covering more of their lifetime needs. o And lastly, as I've stated before, we want to more fully satisfy our client needs by capturing a greater share of their assets. o As an example, we estimate our clients hold approximately $80 billion of cash sitting outside of American Express. o To complement our existing products, which focus on satisfying more of our clients' long-term needs, we have developed a set of additional products such as FDIC insured deposits and sweep accounts, mortgages and home equity loans, margin and enhanced brokerage capabilities. o By focusing on the four areas of opportunity I just covered, we can become an even stronger player and evolve our business model. o So, how are we executing against these opportunities to make them happen? Many of the key initiatives are already underway and we have some good initial results. o We have marshaled our resources across the firm around a framework we call our Building Blocks for growth, to ensure a consistent focus across the organization. The Building Blocks focus on: o attracting more clients, o building deeper client relationships, o ensuring we have the right capabilities and processes in place, o as well as a very effective organization to make it happen. o I have asked Barry, Barbara and Ted to cover in more depth a few of the initiatives that I have already touched upon: o Barry will cover: o Advisor growth, client acquisition and productivity. o Barbara will cover: o Enhancing our product portfolio, asset gathering and overall client segmentation and marketing. o Ted will talk to how we are improving our investment performance and adding to our capabilities. o I'm going to now hand it over to Barry Murphy - Barry. - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Lipper is an independent agency that ranks mutual fund performance by asset class and investment style.

EXHIBIT 99.7 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FINANCIAL COMMUNITY PRESENTATION JIM CRACCHIOLO REMARKS (PART 2) FEBRUARY 5, 2002 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- o Thank you, Ted. o I hope those presentations gave you a better appreciation for the progress we have made and our key initiatives to reposition Financial Advisors. o We believe we have a significant opportunity for greater organic growth. And that is where we are focused. o In addition, we will also evaluate, from time to time, targeted acquisitions that may be a strategic fit with our business. o Although we believe that acquisitions are not a requirement for future growth, they may serve to complement our business model by building upon either our manufacturing or distribution capabilities. o Now, I would like to talk about our last building block, Organization Effectiveness. o It's all about our people, and how we are galvanizing the organization to make it all happen, especially in such a complex environment. o With all the changes that we have introduced over the past two years, the organization has become more focused, aggressive and competitive. o We recognized, for the company to be successful overall, we needed the right leadership, talent and behaviors. o As an example, in regard to our leadership positions, a significant number are now occupied with new talent coming from Financial Advisors, TRS Company, as well as from external hires that have strong industry experience. o Today, we are much more externally focused and we continue to have a very strong focus on meeting client needs. o There is also a clear sense of accountability across the organization to achieve company-wide goals. o Overall, I am particularly pleased to share that even with the tremendous amount of change we have been driving across our business, and the tough times the organization has endured, our employee satisfaction results improved last year. o We had improvements in almost all the dimensions we measure in our satisfaction survey. People are motivated by the direction we are taking to be more competitive. o The last item I want to cover is something I know you are all interested in hearing about. So, let me wrap up with a perspective on our future outlook. o As we think about the future performance of Financial Advisors, we will need to continue executing the initiatives we shared while we are pulling the following levers: o More clients, and better clients. o More advisors, and more productive advisors. o More assets, and a wider range of assets, o More plans, and more accounts per plan. o Let me give you a better sense of how our results could play out in two hypothetical scenarios that assume different levels of market and business growth. o Now, very clearly, these are not projections and don't take into account all of the factors that might affect our business, such as expense levels and interest rates among others. However, they may give you a perspective on our ability to deliver results under various market conditions. o I should also point out that the scenarios assume performance of the metrics over time. o First, looking at Financial Advisors from 1995 to 2000, which was a peak period for our growth, we saw: o Market appreciation of 18%, which contributed to: o 5% Advisor growth o 5% Client growth o 8% in Clients with a plan o 4 Accounts per Client o And, during this period, our net income grew 16% o As you know, it's not realistic for planning purposes to assume market appreciation would continue at the 18% level, driven by one of the great bull markets of all time. o However, with the changes we are making, we are seeking today to achieve metric growth similar to what we achieved in the bull market of the 90's, but now, in a more normalized market. o With that in mind let's look at our possible scenarios: o In our target scenario, we assumed an 8% market appreciation, which, as you know, represents the historical market average and the base assumption used for our goals. In this environment we show: o advisor growth between 4 and 5%, o client growth between 4 and 6%, o the number of clients with a plan 8 to 9%, o with accounts per client between 4 to 4.2, o And, we have assumed our fund performance to be consistent with the performance levels that Ted talked to earlier. o In our target scenario, with these assumptions, we show financial advisors meeting the corporate objectives of net income growth between 12 and 15 percent, on average, over time - - as Ken mentioned. o Now let's turn to a far less favorable environment where our assumption is for 0% market appreciation. o In this instance, we would clearly be influenced by some negative investor sentiment, volatility and uncertainty. o And, we would no doubt scale back some of the spending on our initiatives. o The indicator growth is more modest. o Here, we show expected net income growth for Financial Advisors in the 4% to 7% range. o If, on the other hand, the markets appreciate by greater than 8%, moving back to more robust market conditions, obviously we would be in a better position to produce stronger metrics and net income. o So your next question is: How are we thinking about growth in the current environment? o Well, we at Financial Advisors, like the industry, still have a bit of wind in our face at the moment. o Consumers are concerned about the economy and the geo-political situation. o Markets are down on average 14 percent from last year. o We hope, as I am sure you do, that things will improve, but we are not counting on it. o Therefore, we continue to be focused on reengineering and investing in the most critical capabilities and initiatives. o However, this is not the kind of environment to invest aggressively for growth. o So as you heard from Ken, we continue to be prudent with our investment spending, balancing indicator growth with earnings. o We have built in a level of flexibility that allows us to ramp up or scale back our investments to recognize the conditions around us. o Overall, even with the markets still weak, we are targeting better performance moving forward. o In closing, let me leave you with three key messages: o We made some fundamental changes to strengthen this franchise and absorbed many of the up front costs associated with these changes. o We have put together a series of initiatives to grow this business and we are already making headway. o And, we are a more effective organization that is focused on delivering against our corporate targets, on average and over time. o Thank you. - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Lipper is an independent agency that ranks mutual fund performance by asset class and investment style.

EXHIBIT 99.2 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FINANCIAL COMMUNITY PRESENTATION KENNETH I. CHENAULT REMARKS FEBRUARY 5, 2003 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, Ron. Good afternoon. Welcome to our first financial community meeting of the year. Let me open with today's agenda. I will use the opening 20 minutes or so to review our 2002 performance. I'll go over our financial results, as well as the progress we made during the year to strengthen our business position. I will also give you some perspective on our outlook for the moderate to long-term. Since our progress at Financial Advisors remains a topic of interest for many of you, we decided to cover this business in greater depth today. Jim Cracchiolo and 3 members of his executive team will take you through.......... o the progress we're making at Financial Advisors, o and how we're leveraging our competitive advantages for future growth. As these are the business leaders responsible for implementing much of AEFA's strategy, I thought it would be useful for you to hear about our actions and plans directly from them. As always, the last hour or so will be available for you to ask any questions you may have of me or other members of our management team. * * * * * * * * * * Let me turn to the company's performance for 2002. As you know, 2002 brought with it a number of environmental challenges: o weak economies in markets around the world; o significant volatility and an overall decline in the equity markets; o And, in the latter half of the year, we faced -- and continue to face -- an uncertain international political environment, including, as you know, the possibility of war in Iraq. We entered 2002 with a cautious view of the environment, and therefore developed business plans in line with our conservative outlook. As the year progressed, on the positive side of the equation, we saw the benefit of: o relatively low interest rate levels; o very strong credit performance; o and modest growth in spending by consumers. The environment clearly provided more challenges than benefits. But, even with those challenges, we kept our focus on actions we could control and continued to invest in the business. As a result I feel very good about our full year performance. On a GAAP basis for the year: o Earnings per share were up by 105%........ o Return on equity (as calculated on a trailing 12 month basis) was 20.6%; and....... o Revenue growth was 5%. As you know, our 2001 financial results included a number of significant items which served to depress our year-ago results, and help to explain why earnings more than doubled in 2002. Nevertheless, even after considering these items, our underlying earnings growth was quite strong, and we moved back in the direction of our long-term financial targets. On an overall basis I view our earnings performance, and the quality of those earnings, as quite positive. The flexibility added to our business models over the last two years allowed us to generate solid growth in current earnings....... even with a weak revenue environment .......... and while absorbing significantly higher levels of marketing and other investments. In addition, we continued to make improvements in our risk profile, leading to a stronger consolidated balance sheet. For example: o Our card reserve coverage ratios of past due balances improved for both charge and lending; o We increased our reserves for potential merchant bankruptcies; o And we strengthened reserves within our commercial mortgage portfolio at Financial Advisors. At last year's meeting, I told you about the signposts I'd be using to measure the company's 2002 performance. These signposts represented the 5 business areas most critical to our overall performance. And, as our strategic focus won't be changing in 2003, they'll continue to be priorities for us this year. Here's how we did. I'll start with our company-wide signposts. Are we making progress in continuing to improve our margins? Throughout the year margin improvement was an important priority for the organization. We continued to reengineer our processes and, as a result, saw improvements in operating expenses and provision. On a consolidated basis, our reengineering actions delivered better than expected results, surpassing the $1 billion target we set for ourselves at the beginning of 2002. Workforce reductions accounted for a significant portion of the savings achieved in 2002. Our workforce is down 15% against our base at the beginning of 2001. At TRS, the most significant reductions occurred within our Corporate Travel business........ while at Financial Advisors reductions occurred across the company, from our field leadership to the back office. At the Bank, reengineering actions reduced the workforce by several hundred employees. Employee levels on a reported basis have recently increased due to the buyout of our joint venture partner in Brazil, which moved these JV employees onto our payroll. But workforce actions were just one element of the reengineering benefits we delivered. Another significant component of our margin improvement - and one that is particularly important to sustainability - relates to the internet. We continue to take advantage of our existing internet platforms by shifting additional volumes to the web. o Within the U.S. 80% of our card servicing transactions are now available online. In fact, we have more online interactions with customers than we do by telephone or in person. o As an example at AEFA, 66% of all 401(k) transactions are now done on the net, saving valuable service resources. While we've made good progress at shifting volumes, a lot of opportunity still remains. For example: o In Corporate Travel, only 14% of client transactions were booked online last year; o In U.S. Card, only 1% of cardmember statements are delivered via the web; o And, at Financial Advisors, only 7% of our retail client base is enrolled for online access. Each of our businesses has specific plans in place to move more volumes to the web. With the majority of our online servicing capabilities built and paid for, we expect the internet to generate sustainable margin improvement for us over the near to moderate term. In addition to the internet, we also expect to see short and moderate-term reengineering benefits in a number of other areas. We've already delivered significant savings through improved procurement processes. But with an indirect cost base of over $5 billion, we expect to see further savings as more and more purchases are put under centralized control. Fraud is another good story for us. As a result of reengineering, our fraud provision rate dropped by 45% over the last 2 years. And, as we roll-out additional actions, we expect our cumulative fraud reengineering savings to more than double by 2005. A third key initiative is Global Infrastructure Optimization. As we've discussed before, GIO increases our economic flexibility by leveraging customer service capabilities and educated workforces around the world. We've already taken advantage of opportunities such as this to service: o Japanese cardmembers out of Australia, o European cardmembers in Madrid o and U.S. cardmembers and financial service clients in India. While we will always maintain some level of local servicing in major markets, our opportunity to shift certain types of transactions to lower cost markets continues to be substantial. Over the next few years we expect to ramp this activity up even further. To give you some perspective, the 3 examples I just mentioned represent approximately a quarter of our total 2002 reengineering savings - not an insignificant proportion. And, as you saw, a great deal of potential remains. So looking at our overall margin performance I feel good about the benefits we delivered. But, even more importantly, I feel good about the nature of our actions - specifically, the momentum of our efforts, and the progress we're making in bringing our margins back to 1996 levels. Margin improvement will remain a priority for 2003. And, based on the reengineering opportunities currently identified or underway, our target is to deliver another $1 billion in benefits again this year. The second signpost for the company focused on growth. Are we on the offensive in terms of growth, launching products and services, signing deals and partnerships, outperforming the competition? The benefits we've gained from our business model improvements over the last two years have allowed us to direct a significant portion of our investment dollars to growth initiatives. Going into the year we had a robust list of profitable growth opportunities from which to choose. And, as we told you in the 3rd quarter, our confidence in these opportunities was such that we made a deliberate tradeoff between current earnings and investments in growth. This can be seen most clearly in our marketing line. In the 4th quarter we continued our trend of increasing our marketing dollars at TRS year over year. This growth is in contrast to a number of our peers, several of whom reduced marketing to offset the weak environment. Our spending at TRS is now back to our levels of 2000, and I feel very good about our ability to scale up our marketing investments. So, while it is good that we were able to spend more, the better news is that this spending produced visible results. As we told you in the third quarter, we expected our investments to generate momentum in our fourth quarter metrics, and they did. We grew cards, launched new products and signed new deals. We brought on our highest level of new cards since the first quarter of 2001. Each of our card businesses had strong acquisition performance in the quarter, including U.S. consumer, U.S. small business, International and Global Network Services. Our acquisition efforts in the U.S. and international are increasingly focused on products that provide value and drive spending through incentives and rewards. Contributing to our recent card growth has been the good early performance of our new charge card products with embedded rewards, and our new cash rebate product. Together these products accounted for almost 500,000 new cards in 2002, mostly in the 4th quarter. As we've discussed, rewards-based products not only support our proprietary merchant network with higher spending, but have favorable economics in terms of attrition, credit and payment. In addition to these recent product launches, we continue to grow other reward-based lending products such as Delta and Costco, and are enrolling an increasing number of Blue cardmembers into Membership Rewards. Let me just say a few words about Blue before moving on. Across the lending arena, and particularly for our Blue product, we carefully monitor industry activity and will selectively adjust our APR pricing to be competitive. But, let me tell you, we will not lead the pack in moving to irrational pricing levels....... and we don't think we have to given our value proposition. Many of our peers rely heavily on AR to drive their business models. And, in order to sustain their metrics, they require ever-higher levels of balance growth. While some of the recent low APR offers in the market may gain them balances, it will be at a significant cost to their margins. As we've shared with you in the past, our lending portfolio has a breadth and depth of products -- products intended to meet the needs of various customer segments. Several sizable components of our portfolio have value propositions that are not centered on APR, but on other elements of value - for example: rewards on Costco and Delta products, and the cash float flexibility of our Lending on Charge products. For these products, we can support a higher APR, earn more spread revenue, and provide a more stable earnings stream. Now, returning to growth............... Our new charge card and cashback product are just two examples of the growth momentum we built during the year. o We also launched over 100 proprietary card products across international. o We delivered a number of key account signings in Corporate Services, such as Accenture, Unisys and P&G. o We agreed on an important travel distribution deal with American Airlines. o And, we signed a number of important partnerships, including: - - new GNS issuers such as Toyota Finance in Japan and Lotte in Korea, - - new Membership Rewards partners such as Home Depot and Toys "R" Us, - - and new partners in our Small Business Everyday Savings program, such as Staples and Kinko's. Financial Advisors also expanded their product portfolio, launching a number of new sub-advised funds, insurance products and our American Express ONE (SM) Financial Account. But I'll leave the details of AEFA's progress in this area to Jim and his team later on. As you can see, even with all that was going on externally this year, we stayed on the offensive in terms of growth. We expect our 2002 launches and initiatives - as well as growth initiatives planned for 2003 -- to further improve our market position over the moderate to long-term. The next signpost related specifically to Financial Advisors.............. Have we generated traction against our strategy, as measured by improvements in our metrics and earnings? You'll be hearing about Financial Advisors at length from Jim and his team, but I believe we made solid progress during the year. While earnings performance was still weak given the environment, we gained traction in a number of key areas, including: investment performance, product breadth, and advisor growth. We are still not where we need to be from an overall performance standpoint but, as you'll see, we are clearly moving forward. The next signpost is specific to TRS. Depending on the level of improvement to the economy, is our billed business growing across each of our products and markets? As you can see, our billed business growth trend was quite positive during the year. Corporate billings continued to be weak, but consumer spending in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia remained relatively strong throughout the year. On an absolute basis, our 4th quarter growth rate of 13% was quite strong. We recognize that this growth was off a lower base in 2001, but, nonetheless, our level of 4th quarter billings did represent a record quarter for us. But, in addition to just looking at our absolute growth, we also look at our relative performance. Against this comparison, we stack up fairly well. Our billings growth of 13% in the 4th quarter was generally in line with our top performing peers. These volumes also translated into solid growth in loan balances year over year, where we grew at a rate equal to or better than all other issuers except for Capital One. Looking just at the 4th quarter is perhaps a better way to see our momentum. Comparing loan balances in Q4 against Q3, our growth of 8% on a managed basis was the highest in our peer group. Loan growth in our owned portfolio was 15% versus last quarter. The final signpost is also for TRS. Is credit performing within our expectations, given the environment and the unemployment rate? I believe our credit performance has been very strong. And credit management continues to be a very good story for us. In terms of quality, our loss and delinquency trends improved in the 4th quarter. Our charge card product continues to perform exceptionally well - with our worldwide loss rate now down to an historic low. We continue to see good credit performance in our U.S. loan portfolio. As international is becoming a larger component of our worldwide balances, we also thought it would be useful to show you the writeoff rates for this segment. Both the rates and the trends for international generally track against our U.S. experience. * * * * * * * * With so much uncertainty in the external environment, our goal was to focus on the elements of the business we could control - for example: o Investing in growth............... o Implementing our reengineering plans and delivering against our targets. o And carefully managing our credit performance, which is particularly important in light of the environment. Even with weak revenue growth, we delivered strong earnings, while increasing our investments. And reengineering further improved the flexibility of our business models, increasing my confidence in the sustainability of our performance. I am very proud of what the organization achieved this year. * * * * * * * * There are two other accomplishments I want to mention which, while not having a direct impact on the bottom line, are nonetheless important to our future performance. The first relates to the strength of our organization. Over the last 2 years, our leadership team and our employees have dealt with a significant amount of change, including a 15% reduction in the workforce. One accomplishment I am quite proud of is that we have kept the organization focused and motivated throughout this time. And this is not just based on anecdotes. o Our internal employee survey, which we conduct annually, showed improvements in employee satisfaction for the 7th year in a row; o And, in the recent Fortune Survey on Best Companies to Work for in the U.S., our ranking moved from #91 to #36, exceeding our prior best of #77 in 2000. Given the challenges we face and the goals we want to accomplish, a motivated work force is essential for any service company - and particularly for us given the strong association between service and our brand. Over the last 2 years: o our organization has become tougher; o our executional abilities have improved even further, given all of the change we had to manage; o and our employees have become more resilient, while generally remaining very positive about their work and the company. The second accomplishment I want to mention relates to our corporate focus. One reason I believe we made good progress in 2002 is that we were able to focus most of our time and attention on growth initiatives and business model improvements. We had more time to spend on tactics during the year because we didn't have to spend time questioning and reassessing our strategies and direction. While we continually review and evolve our business strategies, I believe we have the basic questions answered.............. o We know what businesses we are in - global payments and retail financial services. o We know how we want to be positioned with our customers - as a premium provider of value. o And we know how we want to conduct our business - in accordance with our corporate values, and therefore, in accordance with what our brand strands for - integrity, trust, quality, customer commitment and service. Having this clarity, particularly while many other companies are searching for a similar understanding, allows us to be more focused in delivering against our growth objectives. * * * * * * * * * So, how does all of this translate into my outlook for the company over the moderate to long-term? I continue to be optimistic, and for a number of reasons: o The strength and flexibility of our business models; o The range of growth opportunities we have and the priority we've placed on pursuing them; and o The direction and focus of our organization. In July I gave you some historical perspective on our business. I mentioned that, as we looked back over the period from 1980 to 2000, the company had the benefit of a robust environment. o The S&P 500 had appreciated 12% on a compounded basis - including 16% growth from 1995 to 2000. o And, our 20 year compounded billings growth was 14%. It was during this time period that our current financial objectives were set - - 12% to 15% EPS growth, 8% revenue growth, and 18% to 20% ROE - on average and over time. Against the backdrop of today's environment, 20 years of 14% billings growth and 12% market appreciation seems very optimistic. Now, as we prepare our outlook, we use what we consider to be modest assumptions: growth in the average S&P of 8%, and billings growth of 6% to 10% - -- essentially half of our historical rates. Applying these assumptions against our improved economics, our models currently show us being able to achieve 12% to 15% EPS growth over the next 3 to 5 years. There are, of course, all sorts of caveats to these numbers related to interest rates, tax rates, continued reengineering and so on. But essentially our models indicate that, under the economic scenario I've defined for you, our growth objectives are achievable. In addition to our earnings objective, the models also indicate that our group of businesses should deliver Return On Equity, on a consolidated basis, within our long-term targeted range. Another point to note about this outlook is that it assumes our growth remains organic, which I believe is a more stable source of growth for the company. By focusing on core economic levers within each of our existing businesses - such as, reducing cardmember and client attrition, increasing average spending per card, increasing assets per client - I believe we have significant opportunity to grow our earnings. It doesn't mean we won't pursue acquisitions that are targeted and appropriately valued. But it does mean we are not dependent on making acquisitions to achieve our earnings target - we are not on a treadmill. Now, as you know, we have not historically projected our short-term performance. And, given the current environment, I have no intention of starting this practice now. We enter 2003 as we entered 2002 - with a cautious outlook ... and with no expectation that economic conditions will significantly improve. And our current business plans reflect this. In addition, given the uncertainty of the environment, we've prepared contingency plans for each of our businesses. Now I'm not saying we've anticipated, and are prepared for, every possible scenario, but these plans can help us make the tradeoffs we'd face should major events, such as a war in Iraq, occur. Our 2002 performance gives me confidence in our ability to deal with challenges. And the strong foundation we've built over the last 2 years makes me optimistic about our prospects over the moderate to long-term. I feel we are well positioned to deliver strong long-term shareholder value. One important element of our potential growth is American Express Financial Advisors. Given the volatility of the equity markets and our recent financial performance I know that questions have been raised about Financial Advisors' growth potential and its future within our strategy. I felt it was important to address these questions and issues head on, so I decided to put AEFA on today's agenda. As we've told you over the last 18 months, we are implementing significant change at Financial Advisors. o Some of the changes are remedial in nature and represent efforts to close historical gaps; o While other actions represent proactive efforts to leverage AEFA's competitive strengths and advantages. Many of these changes, however, have been behind the scenes, and their full impact is not yet evident in our results. Also, a difficult market environment obscures the view of some of the benefits we've achieved. As a result we want to use our time today to share some of our progress at Financial Advisors, and also share how we're thinking about growth. In addition, we wanted to introduce you to some members of AEFA's executive team so you could hear directly from them about the changes occurring in their areas, and the strategies they're pursuing to position AEFA for growth. The goal today is to provide you with an understanding of: o Financial Advisors' base business model structure and its inherent advantages; o The existing and potential growth opportunities available to us; and o The actions we've taken to capitalize on those opportunities. I thought I would start off by addressing the question: "How does Financial Advisors fit within American Express?" It is my view that American Express is fairly unique within financial services. o We have the advantages of an operating company while still having two different, yet strong, businesses under one roof - global payments and retail financial services. o The complementary nature of the earnings cycle of these businesses (which can be viewed as a "spend" business and an "invest" business) provide added flexibility to our overall company results. o And, we have generally delivered good, consistent returns. While this has not been the case every year over the last 20 - there have clearly been exceptions -- the overall record for these businesses has been very good. And I believe, on a stand-alone basis, both payments and financial services can deliver growth within our targeted ranges - on average and over time. Using just about any metric you choose, our 1984 acquisition of IDS - now American Express Financial Advisors - has been a success. AEFA's historical returns through 2001 are quite impressive. And, in fact, even in the difficult environment of 2002, Financial Advisors generated earnings at a level close to what we paid for them. As we've discussed with you a number of times, these results reflect: o the substantial economic benefits within AEFA's planning based approach o and the combination of its in-house distribution system and manufacturing capabilities. It is difficult to see AEFA's growth reverting back to the 15%+ levels of pre-2001. But as you'll hear from Jim, even assuming equity market growth of only 8% (half the level of the late 1990's), the strengths of our business model, coupled with the changes implemented over the last two years, help position AEFA to grow at a level consistent with our 12% -- 15% financial target, on average and over time. As a result, I am very comfortable with the strategic rationale for the co-existence of our payments and retail financial services businesses. With that, let me now bring up Jim Cracchiolo, Group President of Global Financial Services, and Chairman and CEO of American Express Financial Advisors.

EXHIBIT 99.5 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FINANCIAL COMMUNITY PRESENTATION BARBARA FRASER REMARKS FEBRUARY 5, 2003 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks Barry. As Barry and Jim described, financial planning is the core of our business model. Critical to the success of the business model and clients reaching their goals is implementation of the plan through appropriate products. I will discuss how we are enhancing our product line, broadening our asset gathering capabilities and improving client segmentation and marketing in order to increase our assets and our profitability. I will also discuss how we are evolving our client centric model. Barry explained the power of our financial planning model. Financial planning leads to asset allocation, which by definition requires a diversified product mix. AEFA has one of the most comprehensive product sets amongst retail financial services companies. One of our growth opportunities is to further extend our product mix per client through continued focus on financial planning and increased focus on high value clients. I would like to highlight how we are doing this for mutual funds, annuities, insurance and cash & brokerage. Starting with mutual funds, this is where we have the highest penetration, with 64% of clients owning a mutual fund, and in fact, 61% owning a proprietary fund. We saw opportunities to strengthen our funds business in both our proprietary and non-proprietary funds. First, it was important for us to broaden our American Express proprietary line-up to offer well performing funds across all style classes. In some categories like Small Cap and Value, we were under represented. This next illustrates industry net flows in 2002 through November as well as the relative importance of our proprietary funds in each equity style class. Red represents industry outflows while green represents net inflows. Therefore, our relative proprietary importance in large gap growth left us vulnerable as large cap growth moved out of favor. In fact, over 70% of AXP equity funds were in style categories that experienced negative outflows in 2002, whereas only 30% of our own funds were in categories showing growth. While our net flow trends in large cap growth have actually been better than the industry, we still lost assets because of such significant outflows in that style category. To broaden our product line, we introduced 6 American Express Partners Funds in mid 2001 and added another 4 in 2002. These funds are sub-advised by 17 different top-notch asset managers like Gabelli, Davis, Putnam, and Wellington, several of whom are in the room today. This Partners initiative was essential to providing clients with a broad menu of well performing American Express funds. In fact, since inception, we have generated over $2 billion in net flows in Partners Funds. We know these funds have helped us retain assets, as 80-90% of dollars which moved from existing assets have changed style class at the point of exchange. These are assets that we likely would have lost as the market shifted away from large cap growth. The addition of Partners Funds as well as 4 new internally managed funds over the past 18 months have been critical to preserving assets. We now have the breadth in proprietary equity funds to compete regardless of market shifts in style classes. As a result, American Express Partners funds helped stabilize our internal/external mutual fund sales mix in 2002. Perhaps of equal importance is that our Partner funds are almost as profitable as our internally managed funds. In 2003, our focus will be to enhance our fixed income product line in response to market movement and client needs for fixed products. Now turning to our non-proprietary business, we have had a profit challenge. As Jim mentioned, we opened our distribution network several years ago. We now distribute over 200 fund families providing access to over 3000 funds. Over this period, we saw our proprietary share erode although it is still above the industry average. This was due to our not having a complete product line, as well as some performance issues. You've heard how we are enhancing our line-up and Ted will discuss what we are doing to improve investment performance. Today's challenge is how to increase profit on external funds recognizing their importance in our network and to our clients. In 2003 we are introducing a Select Group Program. This program is consistent with our continued commitment to provide a competitive proprietary, and non-proprietary fund set along with enhanced wholesaling, client and advisor education. In addition to 3 of our bank alliance partners, we have reached an agreement with 8 world-class asset management firms to proactively market their products across our distribution network in exchange for increased revenue sharing. Combined, these firms offer over 700 funds and currently represent about 50% of our external fund sales. While the Select program will continue to provide advisors and clients with a wide range of suitable funds, it will also increase our profitability on external funds. Even though we make more money per asset on proprietary funds, return on capital is actually higher on Select Funds because we do not have the cost of capital associated with our own asset management. Note, however, that the introduction of the Select Group program will intensify competitive pressure on our own products. When you think of AEFA, you may not think of us as a major firm in annuities and insurance. These are, in fact, very important businesses to us with respect to both our clients and our financials. The financial planning model supports the use of these products to protect and grow clients' long-term assets. Clients with financial plans purchase more insurance and annuities. Equally important, insurance and annuities are strong contributors to AEFA earnings. We enjoyed a record sales year in annuities in 2002 of over $8.5 billion with sales up +51% across all channels. This positioned us as 11th amongst the top annuity writers. One of our products, Retirement Advisor Variable Annuity, is the 4th most popular selling variable annuity contract in the country. Despite the market softness in 2002, sales were up 44% in our retail advisor channel and up over 100% in our third party distribution channel to major banks. Annuities have tremendous upside potential since only 75% of our advisors sell variable annuities and only 52% sell fixed annuities. To leverage our advisor platform, we are making a major investment in 2003 to increase annuity wholesaling. At the same, we are aware of the proposed tax law changes, and we will participate in the industry dialogue on the impact for annuities. Insurance, despite its importance to financial planning, is still underdeveloped in our distribution. Current client penetration at Financial Advisors is only 25%. Even at this level we still rank 20th overall amongst the top 25 insurance firms based on annual premiums. Our star product, Variable Life, ranks 4th in sales. While our primary product line is life insurance, we also market disability, long-term care in affiliation with GE, and Property & Casualty. Most important, we have developed a plan to significantly grow our insurance business over the next 5 years. Our growth plan includes the launch of three new life products in 2003. These new products were designed in response to consumer concerns about market volatility and longer life spans. They offer several enhancements, including longer death benefit guarantees up to age 100, tax-free pass through to beneficiaries, and optional term insurance riders. These newest products also have upmarket versions with one-million dollar plus policies, which we call "Estate Series". Our 2003 insurance growth plan calls for major investment in our wholesaling and client/advisor education to drive sales. While clearly all our products help us gather more assets, a newer area of product development for us is in cash & brokerage. This will allow us to accelerate gathering more assets along with deepening our share of wallet. In the past, we didn't emphasize gathering clients' more liquid assets and day-to-day lending needs. As Jim mentioned, we changed that last year, with the introduction of the American Express ONE(SM) Financial Account. The American Express ONE Financial Account links to American Express charge cards plus offers banking features like ATM rebates, free online bill payment, free check writing, overdraft protection and direct deposit. In addition, we are adding numerous lending offers such as mortgages, home equity and margin lending. In 2002 we promoted mortgages in our American Express ONE Financial Account marketing materials to advisors and to our card members. We generated about $2 billion in mortgage registrations, of which we closed $1.4 billion in loans. Most recently, we added a Membership Rewards(R) offer that helped boost average mortgage size by +19% and helped strengthen closing rates by +37%. I've just described the ways we are enhancing our product lines. Now I'd like to transition to how we are bringing together our products, our marketing and the power of the brand to evolve our client centric model. Understanding and meeting client needs is core to our business model. There are several ways we are improving how we do this - through more detailed client segmentation and tailored client offers marketed through an overall brand idea. We started by segmenting our target new clients and existing clients into clear definitions by asset value, age, other key demographics, and behavior patterns. This work then became the catalyst to develop tailored client offers, similar to our Card business. The marketing intent is to structure our approach so as to recognize and incent client value by segment. It's all about getting the right product to the right client at the right time. Though client suitability has always been a foundation of our product development and marketing, this is a more fundamental change in how we look at clients, how we develop products for them, and how we market to them. We started by creating American Express Platinum Financial Services(R) last year for the top tier of our clients who have over $500,000 with us, which Jim mentioned. The Platinum tier is only offered by Platinum advisors who are required to have advanced financial planning qualification like a CFP and take a special training program as well - about 750 of our advisors have qualified for Platinum. Platinum clients receive a premium service agreement covering financial planning, ongoing advice and service, an American Express ONE Financial Account account, a complimentary American Express Platinum card and access to premium products. Our results to date indicate this offer does appeal to upmarket clients. Platinum portfolios for new clients average $970,000 and existing clients are adding over $150,000 in incremental money. The next tier we are developing for 2003 implementation is Gold Financial Services for clients with over $100,000. This is the way we will move our average assets per client up. These High Value Clients already represent 73% of our asset base. By better recognizing their high value, we will cultivate this group to give them a more premium level of products and service. The Gold offer will be predicated on a higher level of personalized advice in conjunction with special products such as "Estate Series" insurance policies with accelerated underwriting, Gold AMEX cards, and a cash management account. This is a similar approach to what I described for Platinum. We are very excited about this opportunity because it is where our AEFA focus on premium value for premium clients can make the biggest difference to our generating superior economics going forward. I've described how client segmentation will help us develop tailored client offers. What will surround all our efforts is what we call a BRAND IDEA. This will become the center-post of all our marketing activities. We will launch an impactful statement of our brand idea with new advertising breaking later this quarter, which will differentiate us in our industry. This new campaign is intended to both attract more clients and to deepen existing client relationships. In 2003, we will adopt this Brand Idea across our advertising, our newsletters, our promotion campaigns and much of our client and advisor collateral. Our media spending will be modest this year given the environmental challenges we all face in 2003. In 2003 AEFA will fully leverage the power of the American Express brand from client segmentation to tailored client offers to brand positioning to marketing & sales integration. Today, I've given you an overview of the various initiatives we've implemented, and that we will build upon, to strengthen our business model through products and client marketing. Next, I'd like to introduce Ted Truscott, our Chief Investment Officer, who will tell you about the terrific progress his group is making in improving the performance of American Express Funds. Thank you.
