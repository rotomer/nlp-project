Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure In April, 2003, a purported class action was filed against American Express Company and one of its subsidiaries (together, the "Company") in the Alameda County Superior Court for the State of California in which the plaintiffs assert two causes of action for violation of certain sections of California's Unfair Competition Law and the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act. The plaintiffs allege that the Company purportedly failed to disclose a transaction fee that is assessed on purchases of goods and/or services in a foreign currency and further allege that the Company includes in its cardmember agreements unconscionable and unlawful arbitration provisions. Based on these allegations, the plaintiffs are seeking injunctive relief, restitution, disgorgement, compensatory and exemplary damages and attorneys' fees and costs on their own behalf and on behalf of a putative California class. The Company has not yet been served with the Complaint relating to the action. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and, in the event it is served with the Complaint, intends to vigorously defend the action.
