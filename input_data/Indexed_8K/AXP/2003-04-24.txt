IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL AND OTHER GOALS, ARE SET FORTH ON PAGE 17 HEREIN AND IN THE COMPANY'S 2002 10-K ANNUAL REPORT, AND OTHER REPORTS, ON FILE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. --------------------------------------------------------------------------
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2003 HIGHLIGHTS o The Company achieved first quarter diluted EPS of $0.53, which increased 15% versus EPS of $0.46 last year. GAAP revenues increased 5%. For the trailing 12 months, ROE was 21%. - 1Q '02 included a net pre-tax benefit of $13MM ($8MM after-tax) reflecting adjustments to the 2001 aggregate restructuring charge reserve at TRS. -- Worldwide average spending per basic card in force increased 7% versus last year (up 5% adjusted for foreign exchange translation); o Compared with the first quarter of 2002: - Despite the economic downturn and war-related concerns, worldwide billed business increased 10% as relatively strong consumer and small business spending in the U.S. offset weak Corporate travel and entertainment business volumes. A comparatively weaker U.S. dollar benefited the reported growth rate by 3%. - TRS' worldwide lending balances on an owned basis of $22.0B increased 10%, while on a managed asset basis loans of $40.1B were up 12% (see discussion of "managed basis" on page 6); - Card credit quality continued to be well controlled and reserve coverage ratios remained strong; - Worldwide cards in force of 57.8MM increased 4%, up 2.2MM from last year and 500K during 1Q `03; and, - AEFA assets owned, managed and administered of $228B were down 10% vs. last year on asset depreciation and net asset outflows. o Additional items of note included: - Marketing and promotion costs at TRS increased 7% versus 1Q '02 as more proactive business building activities continued. Improved metric performance during the quarter reflects the benefits of this increased spending over recent quarters. - Lower funding costs continued to provide benefits, although to a lesser degree than in 2002's quarterly year-over-year comparisons. - AEFA's equity portfolio performance continued to compare well with relative industry results as, on an asset-weighted basis, 68% of equity assets in portfolios were above the median for the first quarter 2003. - The Company's reengineering initiatives are on track to deliver the additional $1B of benefits targeted for the year. To date, these initiatives continued to provide substantial year-over-year expense comparison benefits. Compared with 12/31/01, the net total employee count is down 8,870, or 11%. - In April, as part of our ongoing funding activities, American Express Credit Corporation (Credco) and the Parent Company renegotiated their committed credit line facilities. Total available credit lines are $ 10.85B, including $2.0B allocated to the Parent Company and $8.5B allocated to Credco. Credco has the right to borrow up to a maximum amount of $10.5B, with a commensurate reduction in the amount available to the Parent Company. The remainder of the credit lines is allocated to American Express Centurion Bank. These facilities expire in increments from 2004 through 2007. - As previously announced, the Company began expensing options in 2003. The effect was not material. -1-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2003 HIGHLIGHTS (CONT'D) o American Express continued to invest in growth opportunities through expanded products and services. During the quarter, we: - Introduced Blue Cash from American Express, which combines the valuable benefits of Blue with the cash rebate feature of the existing American Express Cash Rebate card offering up to 5% cash back on purchases; - Launched the Gold Credit Card in Indonesia, and began issuing the Centurion Card in Japan; - Added a number of new partners to the U.S. Membership Rewards program, including The Home Depot(R), Cingular Wireless, Staples(R) and Toys"R"Us(R); - Began offering ID KeeperSM, the industry's first Smart Card application available on the Internet, on Blue from American Express, which "remembers" multiple web sites, online IDs and passwords; offers consumers easy, automated access and entry to favorite web sites; and provides a secure, convenient way to navigate and shop online; - Signed a network partnership agreement with Vietcombank to begin issuing the Vietcombank American Express Green and Gold Credit Cards for consumers in Vietnam; - Partnered with TD Bank Financial Group of Canada to become the exclusive provider of corporate cards and expense management services to TD's commercial and corporate banking clients; - Opened the Shanghai business travel center, CITS American Express Air Services Limited, the only travel management company in China to receive all the essential licenses to offer travel management services and issue both domestic and international air tickets in Beijing and Shanghai; - Announced a multi-year strategic marketing alliance that makes OPEN: The Small Business Network the exclusive small business card advertiser on AOL for Small Business; and - At AEFA: -- Launched two new Life Insurance Products: - American Express(R) Variable Universal Life IV, featuring an income tax-free death benefit guarantee to the age of 100, which can provide clients the certainty of insurance protection regardless of market conditions; - American Express(R) Life Protection Select, which offers a guaranteed lifetime death benefit that passes to the beneficiary income tax-free; and -- Added a High-Yield Savings Account to the offerings of the American Express ONE Financial Account, which combines investing, banking and the American Express card. -2-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2003 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED o Net income increased 12%. - 1Q '02 includes a net pre-tax benefit of $13MM ($8MM after-tax) related to an adjustment to the 2001 aggregate restructuring charge reserve at TRS. o CONSOLIDATED REVENUES: Revenues increased 5% due to greater discount revenues, higher securitization income, increased lending finance charge revenue, larger interest and dividend revenues, and higher card fees. These items were partially offset by lower management and distribution fees. Consolidated revenue growth reflected 7% growth at TRS and an 11% increase at AEB, while AEFA revenues were down 2% versus last year. - On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, which adjusts last year's revenue to reflect the current year's translation rates in order to eliminate foreign currency fluctuations from the comparison, consolidated revenues rose approximately 2% versus last year. o CONSOLIDATED EXPENSES: Expenses were up 3%, reflecting higher other operating expenses, greater human resource costs and increased marketing costs. These increases were partially offset by lower charge card funding costs, reduced provision costs and the benefits of reengineering activities and expense control initiatives. Consolidated expenses reflected increases versus last year of 3% at TRS, 4% at AEFA and 6% at AEB. - On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, which adjusts last year's expenses to reflect the current year's translation rates in order to eliminate foreign currency fluctuations from the comparison, consolidated expenses were approximately flat versus last year. o The pretax margin was 16.5% in 1Q '03 versus 15.3% in 4Q '02 and 14.9% in 1Q `02 o The effective tax rate was 31% in 1Q '03 compared with 28% in 4Q '02 and 1Q '02. o As of March 31, 2003, the company incurred total expenditures of approximately $225MM related to the September 11th terrorist attacks that are expected to be substantially covered by insurance and, consequently, did not impact results. -3-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2003 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED (CONT'D) o SHARE REPURCHASES: The share repurchase program resumed in June 2002, after being suspended at the end of 2Q '01. During 1Q '03, in addition to "open market" repurchases, the company elected to prepay $200MM of the aggregate amount outstanding under its third-party purchase agreements in lieu of "open market" share repurchases. These prepayments have essentially the same impact as "open market" share repurchases. In total, 12.8MM shares were repurchased during 1Q '03, 6.9MM through "open market" activity and 5.9MM through the prepayment. - Since the inception of repurchase programs in September 1994, 403MM shares have been acquired under Board authorizations to repurchase up to 570MM shares, including purchases made under the agreements with third parties. *The increased number of shares issued during 1Q'03 reflects revisions to the Company's compensation strategy which resulted in a reduced level of options granted to senior level management and, in lieu of options, granted restricted stock awards (that are reflected in these amounts) to mid-and-lower level managers. o SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - MANAGED NET REVENUES: The following supplemental revenue information is presented on the basis used by management to evaluate operations. It differs in two respects from the GAAP basis revenues, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). First, revenues are presented as if there had been no asset securitizations at Travel Related Services (TRS). This format is generally termed on a "managed basis", as further discussed in the TRS section of this Earnings Supplement. Second, revenues are considered net of American Express Financial Advisors' (AEFA) provisions for losses and benefits for annuities, insurance and investment certificate products, which are essentially spread businesses, as further discussed in the AEFA section of this Earnings Supplement. A reconciliation of consolidated revenues from a GAAP to net managed basis is as follows: - - Consolidated net revenues on a managed basis increased 4% versus last year, due to greater discount revenues, higher cardmember loan balances, larger interest and dividend revenues, and higher card fees. These items were partially offset by lower management and distribution fees.
CORPORATE AND OTHER o The net expense was $44MM in 1Q '03, 4Q '02 and 1Q `02. - 1Q '02 included a $46MM ($39MM after-tax) Lehman Brothers preferred dividend based on its earnings. This dividend, which was offset by business building initiatives, related to a security that matured in May '02. -4-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2003 OVERVIEW TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES o Net income increased 25%. - 1Q '02 includes a net pre-tax benefit of $13MM ($8MM after-tax) reflecting adjustments to 2001's aggregate restructuring reserve. o The pretax margin was 19.1% in 1Q `03 versus 17.0% in 4Q `02 and 15.9% in 1Q '02. o The effective tax rate rose to 32% in 1Q '03 from 31% in 4Q '02 and 30% in 1Q '02, principally due to a relatively lower Travelers Cheque income contribution. o IMPACT OF SECURITIZATIONS: During 1Q '03 and 1Q '02, TRS recognized pre-tax gains of $43MM ($28MM after-tax) and $42MM ($27MM after-tax), respectively, related to the securitization of $0.9B of U.S. lending receivables in each period. The average balance of Cardmember lending securitizations was $17.6B in 1Q '03 versus $15.4B in 1Q '02. - SECURITIZATION INCOME increased 27% in 1Q '03 as a result of a higher average balance of Cardmember lending securitizations and improved spreads on this portfolio. -- Securitization income represents revenue associated with retained and subordinated interests in securitized loans, servicing income from loans sold and gains recorded at the time of securitization. - NET FINANCE CHARGE REVENUE increased 13%, reflecting an increase in the average balance of the owned portfolio for the period. - OTHER REVENUES decreased 6% as a result of significantly lower interest income on investment and liquidity pools held within card funding vehicles, partially offset by larger insurance premiums. - THE LENDING PROVISION declined 4% reflecting strong credit quality in the lending portfolio. - The above GAAP basis items relating to net finance charge revenue, other revenues and lending provision reflect the owned portfolio only. "Owned basis" credit quality statistics are available in the First Quarter 2003 Earnings Release on the TRS Selected Statistical Information page. -5-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2003 OVERVIEW TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES (CONT'D) SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - MANAGED BASIS: The following supplemental table includes information on both a GAAP basis and a "managed" basis. The managed basis presentation assumes there have been no securitization transactions, i.e., all securitized Cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected in the Company's balance sheet and income statement, respectively. The Company presents TRS information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company's Cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized Cardmember loans. Asset securitization is just one of several ways for the Company to fund Cardmember loans. Use of a managed basis presentation, including non-securitized and securitized Cardmember loans, presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the Cardmember lending business, avoiding distortions due to the mix of funding sources at any particular point in time. For example, irrespective of the mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics, such as changes in delinquencies and write-off rates, for the entire Cardmember lending portfolio because it is more representative of the economics of the aggregate Cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of Cardmember loans and related revenue and changes in market share, which are all significant metrics in evaluating the Company's performance and which can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized Cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The following table compares and reconciles the GAAP basis TRS income statements to the managed basis information, where different. The following discussion addresses results on a managed basis. o Managed basis net revenue rose 7% from higher Cardmember spending, increased cards in force, larger lending balances and greater travel commissions and fees. o The 3% higher managed basis expenses reflect greater marketing and promotion costs, higher human resource expenses and increased operating expenses, partially offset by lower interest costs, reduced provisions for losses and cost control initiatives. -6-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2003 OVERVIEW TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES (CONT'D) o DISCOUNT REVENUE: A 10% increase in billed business and a lower discount rate yielded a 7% increase in discount revenue. - The average discount rate was 2.60% in 1Q `03 versus 2.62% in 4Q `02 and 2.66% in 1Q `02. The decline primarily reflects the cumulative impact of stronger than average growth in the lower rate retail and other "everyday spend" merchant categories (e.g., supermarkets, discounters, etc.). -- We believe the AXP value proposition is strong. However, as indicated in prior quarters, continued changes in the mix of business, volume related pricing discounts and selective repricing initiatives will probably continue to result in some rate erosion over time. (a) Proprietary card activity only. (b) At September 30, 2002, 1.5MM of Canadian lending cards previously classified as "supplemental cards" were included in basic cards in force, as they were issued under a stand-alone offer. The impact on 1Q '02 reported results would be to increase basic cards in force outside the U.S. to 17.1MM and decrease spending per basic card in force worldwide to $1,766 and outside the U.S. to $1,215. The reported growth rates are calculated assuming the additional cards were included in both periods. - BILLED BUSINESS: The 10% increase in billed business resulted from 4% growth in cards in force and a 7% increase in spending per basic cardmember worldwide. -- Worldwide billed business increased 13% in January, 10% in February and 7% in March. -- U.S. billed business was up 8% reflecting growth of 10% within the consumer card business, on 12% higher transaction volume, an 11% increase in small business services and a 1% increase in Corporate Services volume. - Spending per basic card in force increased 8% reflecting the growth in each customer segment. -- Excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation: - Worldwide billed business rose 7%. - Total billed business outside the U.S. was up 3% reflecting low double-digit improvement in Canada, mid single-digit growth in Asia, and a slight increase in Europe, partially offset by a mid single-digit decline in Latin America. On a monthly basis, total billed business outside the U.S. increased 6% in January, 3% in February and 1% in March. - Spending per proprietary basic card in force outside the U.S. fell 3%. -- Network partnership and Purchasing Card volumes sustained their relatively stronger growth performance during the quarter. -- U.S. non-T&E related volume categories (which represented approximately 63% of 1Q `03 U.S. billed business) grew 13%, while T&E volumes were flat, reflecting further weakening in the T&E environment during the quarter. U.S. non-T&E related volumes were up 15% in January, 13% in February and 12% in March, while T&E related volumes were up 5% in January, flat in February and down 4% in March. -- Airline related volume, which represented approximately 13% of total U.S. volumes during the quarter, rose 2% in January, and declined 4% in February and 13% in March, respectively. Worldwide airline volumes for the quarter were down 1% on 5% growth in transaction volume and a 6% decrease in the average airline charge. -7-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2003 OVERVIEW TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES (CONT'D) o DISCOUNT REVENUE (CONT'D): - CARDS IN FORCE worldwide rose 4% versus last year. -- U.S. cards in force rose 300K during the quarter as the benefits of stepped up acquisition spending within the consumer and small business segments offset continued declines in corporate cards in force resulting from workforce reductions. -- Outside the United States, 200K cards in force were added during the quarter on proprietary card growth. o NET CARD FEES: Rose 7% due to higher cards in force and a shift in the mix of products. The average fee per proprietary card in force was $35 in 1Q '03, $34 in 4Q '02 and $33 in 1Q `02. o NET FINANCE CHARGE REVENUE: Rose 10% on 11% growth in average worldwide lending balances. - The yield on the U.S. portfolio was 9.4% in 1Q `03 versus 9.8% in 4Q '02 and 9.6% in 1Q '02. The decrease versus last year and last quarter reflects an increase in the proportion of the portfolio on introductory rates and the evolving mix of products toward more lower-rate offerings, partially offset by lower funding costs. o TRAVEL COMMISSIONS AND FEES: Increased 4% on a 1% decline in travel sales reflecting the effects of the weak travel environment. The revenue earned per dollar of sales was up versus last year, but down versus 4Q `02 (9.3% in 1Q `03 versus 9.6% in 4Q `02 and 8.8% in 1Q `02) due to variances in the mix of activities. Travel sales increased 2% in January, was flat in February, and declined 5% in March. o TC INVESTMENT INCOME: Was up 2% on higher average investments, partially offset by a decline in the pretax yield. TC sales fell 10% in the quarter on weaker travel activity. o OTHER REVENUES: Increased 5% as higher card commissions and assessments and larger insurance premiums were partially offset by significantly lower interest income on investment and liquidity pools held within card funding vehicles. o MARKETING AND PROMOTION EXPENSES: Increased 8% on the continuation of the brand advertising activities, the new Blue campaign, more loyalty marketing and a step-up in selected card acquisition activities. o OTHER PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES AND CLAIMS: Declined 37% reflecting last year's reserve additions related to credit exposures to travel industry service establishments. o CHARGE CARD INTEREST EXPENSE: Was down 14% due to a lower effective cost of funds. o HUMAN RESOURCE EXPENSES: Increased 2% versus last year as a lower number of employees, resulting from reengineering activities, including our technology and service-related outsourcing activities, was offset by merit increases, higher employee benefits and increased management incentive costs. - The employee count at 3/03 of 63,900 was down approximately 8,000 or 11%, versus 12/31/01. o OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES: Increased 11% on higher costs related to Cardmember loyalty programs, as well as the transfer of costs from human resources resulting from outsourcing. These increases were partially offset by reengineering initiatives and cost containment efforts. -8-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2003 OVERVIEW TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES (CONT'D) o CREDIT QUALITY: - Overall credit quality improved during the quarter. - The provision for losses on charge card products decreased 17% on improved past due and loss levels. - The lending provision for losses was 1% below last year despite growth in outstanding loans and increased reserve coverage levels due to exceptionally well-controlled credit. - Reserve coverage ratios, which are well in excess of 100% of past due balances, remained strong. - WORLDWIDE CHARGE CARD: * -- The write-off rate decreased from last year and last quarter to a record quarterly low. The past due rate improved versus last year and, consistent with seasonal factors, increased versus last quarter. * There are no off-balance sheet Charge Card securitizations. Therefore, "Owned basis" and "Managed basis" credit quality statistics for the Charge Card portfolio are the same. ** As previously described, this information is presented on a "Managed basis". "Owned basis" credit quality statistics are available in the First Quarter 2003 Earnings Release on the Selected Statistical Information page. Credit trends are generally consistent under both reporting methods. -9-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2003 OVERVIEW AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS o Net income decreased 27% on the continuation of the weak market environment. o Total revenues decreased 2% due to: - Reduced management fees from lower average managed asset levels; partially offset by - Higher investment income; and - Higher insurance premiums. o The pretax margin was 12.6% in 1Q '03, 14.3% in 4Q '02 and 17.6% in 1Q '02. o The effective tax rate declined to 25.0% in 1Q '03, from 25.9% in 4Q '02, and 27.9% in 1Q '02 on a relatively higher benefit from tax-advantaged investments. o SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - NET REVENUES: In the following table, the Company presents AEFA's aggregate revenues on a basis that is net of provisions for losses and benefits because the Company manages the AEFA business and evaluates its financial performance, where appropriate, in terms of the "spread" on its products. An important part of AEFA's business is margin related, particularly the insurance, annuity and certificate businesses. One of the gross margin drivers for the AEFA business is the return on invested cash, primarily generated by sales of insurance, annuity and investment certificates, less provisions for losses and benefits on these products. These investments tend to be interest rate sensitive. Thus, GAAP revenues tend to be higher in periods of rising interest rates, and lower in times of decreasing interest rates. The same relationship is true of provisions for losses and benefits, only it is more accentuated period-to-period because rates credited to customers' accounts generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on underlying investments. The Company presents this portion of the AEFA business on a net basis to eliminate potentially less informative comparisons of period-to-period changes in revenue and provisions for losses and benefits in light of the impact of these changes in interest rates. -10-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2003 OVERVIEW AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS (CONT'D) - On a net revenue basis, the pretax margin was 19.7% in 1Q '03, 22.8% in 4Q '02, and 26.2% in 1Q '02. o ASSETS OWNED, MANAGED AND ADMINISTERED: o ASSET QUALITY: - Overall, credit quality reflected improving default rates compared to last year, but a higher perceived risk level related to certain credit exposures, the most significant portion of which were related to the airline industry. - Non-performing assets relative to invested assets (excluding short-term cash positions) were 0.1% and were 454% covered by reserves, including those related to the impairment of securities. - High-yield investments totaled $1.8B, or 5% of the total investment portfolio, at 3/31/03, versus 6% at 12/31/02, and 5% at 3/31/02. Going forward, AEFA continues to target a level of approximately 7%. - The SFAS No. 115 related mark-to-market adjustment on the portfolio (reported in assets pretax) was appreciation of $1.1B at 3/03 and at 12/02, and depreciation of ($54MM) at 3/02. o INVESTMENT INCOME: - Investment income increased 5% as higher invested assets more than offset a lower average yield. In 1Q '03, $182MM of investment impairments and losses, the most significant portion of which were airline-related exposures, were more than offset by $187MM of investment gains, primarily from the sales of mortgage-backed securities where where AEFA repositioned its portfolio to improve its prepayment risk profile. - Average invested assets of $42.0B (excluding unrealized appreciation/depreciation) rose 19% versus $35.4B in 1Q '02 reflecting strong client interest in the underlying fixed rate products over the past year. - The average yield on invested assets declined to 5.2% versus 6.3% in 1Q '02, reflecting a higher level of short-term holdings during 1Q '03 and lower new investment yields. - Spreads within the insurance and annuity products were down versus last year and last quarter, as portfolio yields have declined further than contract crediting rates, some of which have reached the minimum guaranteed rates contracted. Certificate spreads were up versus last year and last quarter. -11-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2003 OVERVIEW AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS (CONT'D) o MANAGEMENT AND DISTRIBUTION FEES: The decrease of 13% was primarily due to lower average assets under management, reflecting the negative impact of weak equity market conditions and net outflows within both institutional and retail activities. Distribution fees also declined as the impact of substantially lower mutual fund sales was partially offset by higher fees from variable annuity and variable life products, as well as greater limited partnership product sales. - ASSETS MANAGED: -- The decline in managed assets since 3/02 resulted from $23.2B of market depreciation, reflecting in part the 26% decline in the S&P 500 during the year, and $9.2B of net outflows. -- The $3.3B decrease in managed assets during 1Q '03 resulted from market depreciation of $1.6B and net outflows of $1.7B. o PRODUCT SALES: - Total gross cash sales from all products were down 7% versus 1Q '02. Branded advisor-generated sales decreased 11% on a cash basis, and declined 5% on the internally used "gross dealer concession" basis, which weights the sales of products to reflect their individual profitability dynamics. - Mutual fund sales decreased 22% as both proprietary and non-proprietary sales declined substantially. A significant portion of nonproprietary sales continued to occur in "wrap" accounts. Within proprietary funds: -- Sales of bond, equity and money market funds declined. -- Redemption rates continued to compare favorably with industry levels. - Annuity sales rose 42% on strong growth in both fixed and variable annuity sales. - Sales of insurance products fell 12% reflecting lower sales of life products, partially offset by higher property-casualty sales, in part due to sales through Costco. - Certificate sales increased 66% reflecting both greater advisor sales and sales of certificates sold to clients outside the U.S. through the joint venture between AEFA and AEB. - Institutional sales decreased 43%, reflecting lower new account sales, partially offset by higher contributions. - Other sales increased 64% due to increased contributions in the 401(k) business and strong limited partnership activities. - Advisor product sales generated through financial planning and advice services were 76% of total sales in 1Q '03 versus 74% in 4Q '02 and 73% in 1Q '02. o OTHER REVENUES: Were up 8% on particularly strong property-casualty and higher life insurance-related revenues. - Financial planning and advice services fees of $32MM increased 7% versus 1Q '02. o PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES AND BENEFITS: Annuity product provisions increased 10% due to a higher inforce level and increased costs of $6MM related to guaranteed minimum death benefits, partially offset by lower crediting rates. Insurance provisions increased 12% as higher inforce levels and higher claims were partially offset by lower crediting rates. Certificate provisions decreased 21% from significantly lower crediting rates, partially offset by higher average reserves. -12-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2003 OVERVIEW AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS (CONT'D) o HUMAN RESOURCES: Expenses declined 4% reflecting lower field force compensation-related costs, the benefits of reengineering and cost containment initiatives within the home office, where the average number of employees were down 8%, and the impact of technology and service-related outsourcing which transferred costs to other operating expenses. This improvement was partially offset by merit increases, higher employee benefits and management incentive costs. - TOTAL ADVISOR FORCE: 11,606 at 3/03; up 104 advisors, or 1%, versus 3/02 and down 83 advisors versus 12/02. -- The decrease in advisors versus 12/02 reflects seasonal factors, in addition to higher termination rates due to the continuing weak environment. -- We expect to continue to carefully manage new advisor additions until the environment turns more positive, to ensure overall field force costs are appropriately controlled and overall field force productivity is maximized. -- Veteran advisor retention rates remain strong. -- Total production and advisor productivity were down versus last year. -- The total number of retail clients increased 2%, client acquisitions were lower and accounts per client were flat. Client retention exceeded 94%. o OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES: Increased 17% versus last year and was slightly lower versus 4Q '02. The increase from last year reflects higher expenses resulting from fewer capitalized costs due to the ongoing impact of the comprehensive review of DAC-related practices discussed in 3Q '02, outsourcing, which transferred costs from human resources, and a higher minority interest expense related to premium deposits (the joint venture with AEB). -13-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2003 OVERVIEW AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK o Net income increased 55% as higher revenue and a lower provision for losses offset higher expenses. o Net revenues grew 11%. - Net interest income rose 5% primarily due to lower funding costs and higher business volumes. - Commissions and fees were up 9% due to higher fees in the Financial Institutions Group and Private Banking, partially offset by reduced Corporate banking activities. - Foreign exchange income & other revenues increased 24% on higher foreign currency-related trading revenue, higher client activity in Private Banking and greater revenue from lower funding costs within premium deposits (the joint venture with AEFA). o Human resource and other operating expenses combined were up 14% reflecting a higher employee level, due to the 2002 purchase of the remaining 50% of AEB's Brazil joint venture, greater technology costs, merit increases, and higher employee benefits and management incentive costs. o The provision for losses decreased as bankruptcy related write-offs in the consumer lending portfolio in Hong Kong stabilized, although they remain high relative to historical levels. o AEB remained "well-capitalized". -14-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2003 OVERVIEW AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK (CONT'D) o EXPOSURES - AEB's loans outstanding were $5.7B at 3/03 versus $5.3B at 3/02 and $5.6B at 12/02. Activity since 3/02 included a $200MM net decrease in corporate banking and other loans (including an $80MM increase in loans from the purchase of the remaining 50% of AEB's Brazil joint venture), a $400MM increase in financial institution loans and a $200MM increase in consumer and private banking loans. Consumer and private banking loans comprised 65% of total loans at 3/03, and 66% at 12/02 and 3/02; corporate banking and other loans comprised 8% of total loans at 3/03, 9% at 12/02, and 13% at 3/02; and financial institution loans comprised 27% of total loans at 3/03, 25% at 12/02, and 21% at 3/02. - In addition to the loan portfolio, there are other banking activities, such as forward contracts, various contingencies and market placements, which added approximately $7.6B to the credit exposures at 3/03, $8.0B at 12/02 and $7.3B at 3/02. Of the $7.6B of additional exposures at 3/03, $5.5B were relatively less risky cash and securities related balances. (1)Includes cash, placements and securities. (2)Individual items may not add to totals due to rounding. (3)Total exposures to Argentina at 3/31/03 were $27MM, which includes loans of $16MM, compared to 12/31/02 exposures of $28MM, including $17MM of loans. Note: Includes cross-border and local exposure and does not net local funding or liabilities against any local exposure. -15-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2003 OVERVIEW AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK o Total non-performing loans* were $106MM at 3/03, compared to $119MM at 12/02 and $128MM at 3/02 as AEB continues to wind down its Corporate Banking business. The decreases reflect loan payments and write-offs, partially offset by net downgrades, mostly in Egypt and India. o Other non-performing assets were $15MM at 3/03 and at 12/02, and $2MM at 3/02. o AEB's total credit loss reserves at 3/03 of $155MM compared with $158MM at 12/02 and $160MM at 3/02, and are allocated as follows: - Loan loss reserve coverage of non-performing loans* of 136% at 3/03 compared with 127% at 12/02 and 120% at 3/02. o Management formally reviews the loan portfolio and evaluates credit risk throughout the year. This evaluation takes into consideration the financial condition of the borrowers, fair market value of collateral, status of delinquencies, historical loss experience, industry trends and the impact of current economic conditions. As of March 31, 2003, management considers the loss reserve to be appropriate. * AEB defines a non-performing loan as any loan (other than certain smaller-balance consumer loans) on which the accrual of interest is discontinued because the contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or if, in management's opinion, the borrower is unlikely to meet its contractual obligations. For smaller-balance consumer loans related to the Personal Financial Services business, management establishes reserves it believes to be adequate to absorb credit losses in the portfolio. Generally, these loans are written off in full when an impairment is determined or when the loan becomes 120 or 180 days past due, depending on loan type. For this portfolio, 30-day past due rates were 5.0% at 3/03, as compared to 5.4% at 12/02 and 4.5% at 3/02. -16-

EXHIBIT 99.1 NEWS RELEASE NEWS RELEASE NEWS RELEASE NEWS RELEASE [Logo of American Express] Contact: Molly Faust Michael J. O'Neill 212/640-0624 212/640-5951 molly.faust@aexp.com mike.o'neill@aexp.com FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE *Computed on a trailing 12-month basis. 1
New York - April 24, 2003 - AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY today reported record first quarter net income of $692 million, up 12 percent from $618 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) rose to $0.53, up 15 percent from $0.46 a year ago. The company's return on equity was 20.7 percent. Revenues on a GAAP basis totaled $6.0 billion, up five percent from $5.8 billion a year ago. A 10 percent rise in spending on American Express cards and a similar increase in cardmember lending balances more than offset the impact of weak financial markets on revenues at American Express Financial Advisors (AEFA). Consolidated expenses on a GAAP basis totaled $5.0 billion, up three percent from $4.9 billion a year ago. This increase reflects in part higher cardmember loyalty expenses and increased card marketing programs. The increase was partially offset by a lower provision for losses, reflecting further improvement in credit quality as well as the benefit of lower interest rates. "Despite a severe slowdown in the travel sector, continued pressure on corporate cardmember spending and weak financial markets, we generated our highest-ever first quarter earnings," said Kenneth I. Chenault, Chairman and CEO. "The results for the quarter illustrated some of the fundamental changes we've been making over the last two years to adapt our business to a more difficult economic environment. Key factors included: o Higher cardmember revenues from retail and everyday spending, which offset weakness in our traditional travel and entertainment sector. o Growth in the cardmember lending portfolio, which provided a strong complement to our traditional charge card business. 2
o Expanded rewards programs, which helped to strengthen cardmember loyalty and distinguish our products from the competition. o Our strong risk management capability, which contributed to industry-leading credit indicators in the card business. o Re-engineering programs, which helped lower our expenses and gave us the flexibility to re-invest these savings in business-building initiatives. o The shift from the corporate to consumer market, which is producing stronger and more consistent results at American Express Bank (AEB). o An improved risk profile, stronger investment performance and tighter expense control, which are helping AEFA through prolonged market weakness and setting the foundation for a turnaround when conditions improve." Mr. Chenault added, "Despite some specific areas of weakness, we are seeing good overall momentum in our business. Fortunately, we entered 2003 with a business plan that took a cautious approach, with no expectation that economic conditions would significantly improve." The first quarter revenue growth reflected increases of seven percent at American Express Travel Related Services (TRS) and 11 percent at AEB, partially offset by a two percent decline at AEFA. More specifically, o Discount revenue from cardmember spending increased seven percent. o Net finance charge revenue increased 13 percent from strong growth in the cardmember lending portfolio. o Securitization income rose 27 percent, reflecting a higher level of securitized lending balances and improved spreads for this portfolio. 3
o Investment income and insurance-related revenue rose at AEFA. These items were partially offset by: o A 13 percent decline in management and distribution fees reflecting a decrease in the assets managed for AEFA clients. The rise in first quarter expenses reflected an increase of three percent at TRS, four percent at AEFA, and six percent at AEB. More specifically, the overall increase reflected: o An 11 percent increase in other operating expenses, including an 11 percent increase at TRS. This increase was driven in part by higher loyalty program costs and the impact of technology and service-related outsourcing, which transferred certain costs that had previously been included in human resources expense. o A one percent increase in marketing and promotion expenses, including a seven percent increase at TRS. o A one percent increase in human resources expense, as increased costs related to employee benefits were partially offset by lower staffing levels and outsourcing. These items were partially offset by: o A 15 percent decline in interest expense, primarily reflecting the same percent decline in charge card interest expense at TRS. o A four percent decrease in total provision for losses. Credit quality remained very strong in TRS' charge and credit card portfolios as charge card provision declined 17 percent and lending provision declined four percent. Reserve coverage ratios remained strong. 4
TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES (TRS) reported first quarter 2003 net income of $584 million, up 25 percent from $467 million a year ago. On a GAAP basis, TRS' results for both periods included net cardmember lending securitization gains. Gains for the 2003 quarter totaled $43 million ($28 million after-tax) compared with gains of $42 million ($27 million after-tax) a year ago. The following discussion of first quarter results presents TRS segment results on a "managed basis", as if there had been no cardmember lending securitization transactions. This is the basis used by management to evaluate operations and is consistent with industry practice. For further information about managed basis and reconciliation of GAAP and managed TRS information, see the "Managed Basis" section below. The AEFA, AEB and Corporate and Other sections below are presented on a GAAP basis. Total net revenues increased seven percent from the year-ago period, reflecting solid increases in spending and borrowing on American Express cards. Higher cardmember spending contributed to a seven percent rise in discount revenue. This was driven by strong growth in the retail and everyday spending categories. The increase also reflected growth in the number of American Express Cards, higher average cardmember spending and the continued benefit of rewards programs. Net finance charge revenue increased 10 percent, reflecting continued growth in loan balances. Net card fees also increased. Total expenses increased three percent. Marketing and promotion expenses rose eight percent from year-ago levels, reflecting the continued expansion of card-acquisition programs. Human resources expense increased two percent as increased costs related to employee benefits were partially offset by lower staffing levels and outsourcing. Other operating expenses increased due in part to higher 5
cardmember loyalty program costs and the impact of technology and service-related outsourcing, which transferred certain costs that had previously been included in human resources expense. The total provision for losses declined seven percent, reflecting very strong overall credit quality in both the charge card and lending portfolios. Despite the strong credit quality, reserve coverage of lending receivables was strengthened in light of continued uncertainty within the economic environment. Charge card interest expense decreased 13 percent largely due to lower funding costs. AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS (AEFA) reported first quarter 2003 net income of $133 million, down 27 percent from $182 million a year ago. Total revenues decreased two percent. Continued weakness in the equity markets along with outflows of managed assets contributed to lower levels of assets under management and management fees compared with year-ago levels. On a net basis during the first quarter, AEFA realized a gain of $5 million in its investment portfolio. Year-ago investment gains essentially offset losses. On a gross basis for the first quarter 2003, AEFA realized gains of $187 million versus $182 million of impairments and losses, the most significant of which were airline-related exposures. Total expenses increased four percent. Human resources expense decreased four percent, reflecting lower sales-related compensation and continued benefits of re-engineering and cost controls. Other operating expenses increased 17 percent. This reflected in part higher expenses resulting from fewer capitalized costs due to the ongoing impact of the comprehensive review of Deferred Acquisition Costs-related practices discussed in the third quarter of 2002. 6
AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK (AEB) reported net income for the first quarter of 2003 of $19 million up 55 percent from $13 million a year ago. AEB's results reflect higher foreign currency-related and other revenues, lower funding costs, and lower provisions for losses primarily due to the stabilization of write-offs in the consumer lending portfolio. These benefits were partially offset by higher technology and human resources expenses. CORPORATE AND OTHER reported first quarter net expenses of $44 million in both 2003 and 2002. Results for 2002 include a preferred stock dividend of $46 million ($39 million after-tax) based on earnings from Lehman Brothers, which was offset by expenses related to business-building initiatives. *** As previously announced, the company began expensing options in 2003. The effect was not material. *** 7
MANAGED BASIS - TRS Managed basis means the presentation assumes there have been no securitization transactions, i.e. all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected in the company's balance sheet and income statement, respectively. The company presents TRS information on a managed basis because that is the way the company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Asset securitization is just one of several ways for the company to fund cardmember loans. Use of a managed basis presentation, including non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans, presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business, avoiding distortions due to the mix of funding sources at any particular point in time. For example, irrespective of the funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics, such as changes in delinquencies and write-off rates, for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue and changes in market share, which are all significant metrics in evaluating the company's performance and which can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The Consolidated Section of this press release and attachments provide the GAAP presentation for items described on a managed basis. 8
