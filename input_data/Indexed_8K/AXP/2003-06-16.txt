"My colleagues and I are delighted with this agreement," said Davies. "Threadneedle's customers will continue to benefit from our successful investment process, and we will maintain our close working relationship with Zurich. At the same time we will also have the benefits of becoming part of American Express, one of the best known brands in global financial services."
