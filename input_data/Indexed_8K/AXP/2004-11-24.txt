Item 4.01 Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant. As previously disclosed in the American Express Company ("Company") 2004 Proxy, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company determined to request proposals from auditing firms for the Company's 2005 audit. This request was made pursuant to the Audit Committee's charter, which requires a detailed review of the Company's outside audit firm at least every ten years. At a meeting held on November 22, 2004, the Audit Committee approved the future engagement of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PWC") as the independent registered public accountants ("auditors") of the American Express Incentive Savings Plan (the "Plan") for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2005 to replace the firm of Ernst & Young LLP ("E&Y"). E&Y will continue as the auditors for the financial statements of the Plan for the year ending December 31, 2004. The Audit Committee's decision to replace the current auditors was made after a robust proposal process that included three of the four major international accounting firms, including E&Y. E&Y's reports on the Plan's financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. In connection with the audits of the Plan's financial statements for each of the two fiscal years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003 and through November 22, 2004, there were no disagreements with E&Y on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of E&Y, would have caused E&Y to make reference to the matter in their report. During the two most recent fiscal years and through November 22, 2004, there have been no "reportable events" (as defined in Regulation S-K, Item 304(a) (1) (v)). The Plan has requested E&Y to furnish the Plan with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the above statements. A copy of E&Y's letter, dated November 24, 2004, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K. Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits. (c) Exhibits. 16.1 Letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission from Ernst & Young LLP. - 1 -
