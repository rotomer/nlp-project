Item 8.01 Other Events On December 16, 2004, several subsidiaries of American Express Company ("American Express") entered into an agreement to sell and lease back a total of seven real properties located in the United States to designated affiliates of The Inland Real Estate Group, Inc. ("Inland") and closed on the sale of six of those properties. The closing of the remaining property is subject to customary closing conditions. In addition, a subsidiary of American Express in Canada expects to shortly enter into an agreement with Inland to sell and lease back one property in Canada. These sale and leaseback transactions will enable American Express to monetize the value of these properties and use the proceeds for re-investment in its businesses. At each closing, an affiliate of Inland will lease the relevant property back to a subsidiary of American Express for a ten-year term, with an option given to American Express to renew the lease for up to six renewal terms of five years each. The leases will be net leases whereby each American Express entity that leases back the property is responsible for all costs and expenses relating to the property (including maintenance, repair, utilities, operating expenses and insurance costs) in addition to annual rent. The eight properties comprise approximately 2.6 million square feet and have an aggregate net book value of approximately $235 million and an aggregate sales price of approximately $390 million. The aggregate annual rent for the first five years of the leases for all the eight properties would be approximately $25 million. The sale leaseback transactions will not materially impact financial results in any year. Gains resulting from completed sale and leaseback transactions will be amortized over the initial ten-year lease periods. The six properties that were sold on December 16, 2004 are the American Express Service Centers in Fort Lauderdale, Greensboro, and Phoenix; the American Express Data Center in Minneapolis; the IDS Property Casualty Insurance Corporation headquarters in Depere, Wisconsin; and the American Express Finance Center in Phoenix. The remaining property to be sold upon completion of customary closing conditions is the American Express Service Center in Salt Lake City. The property in Canada is the Canadian Operating Center in Markham, Ontario.
