Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2004, American Express Company (the "Company") intends to enhance the presentation used in connection with the reporting of certain financial information relating to its three segments - Travel Related Services ("TRS"), American Express Financial Advisors ("AEFA") and American Express Bank ("AEB"). For TRS, the Company intends to expand the presentation of the Other Operating Expenses line item reflected in TRS results of operations to further detail the components thereof. For AEFA, the Company intends to expand the AEFA Statement of Income to disclose (i) revenue and provision expense information with respect to certain products and lines of business, (ii) additional information regarding Human Resource expenses and (iii) Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs (which historically had been included in the Human Resources and Other Operating Expenses line items). For AEB, the Company intends to expand the reporting of Selected Statistical Information to provide additional information as to the characteristics of its loan portfolio and related loan loss reserves, in particular to provide more information with respect to the loan portfolios and related loan loss reserves of Consumer Financial Services (formerly known as Personal Financial Services) and other AEB loans, and to provide enhanced disclosure with respect to AEB's owned, managed and administered assets. The Company intends to utilize this enhanced presentation in its future financial reporting. The changes in presentation described above will have no impact on TRS's, AEFA's or AEB's respective total revenues, total expenses or net income or on their respective total assets or total liabilities. Separately, an AEFA reclassification, relating to certain Threadneedle activities ($30 million in the fourth quarter 2003 and $26 million in the second quarter 2004), reducing Human Resources-Field expenses and Investment Management and Service Fees revenue has also been reflected.

EXHIBIT 99.1 Securitization income, net represents revenue relating to the Company's retained interests in securitized loan receivables, which includes non-credit provision components of the net gains or charges from securitization activities, excess spread related to securitized loans, net finance charge revenue on retained interests in securitized loans and servicing income, net of related discounts or fees. Management views the gains from securitizations as discretionary benefits to be used for card acquisition expenses, which are reflected in both marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses and other operating expenses. Consequently, the above managed Selected Financial Information for the quarters ended March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004 assumes that the impact of this net activity of $8 million, $9 million and $9 million, respectively, from lending securitizations was offset by higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses of $4 million, $6 million and $6 million, respectively, and other operating expenses of $4 million, $3 million and $3 million, respectively. Accordingly, the incremental expenses, as well as the impact of this net activity, have been eliminated. -1-

(A) Loans other than certain smaller-balance consumer loans (including loans impaired under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan"), are placed on non-performing status when payments of principal or interest are 90 days past due or if, in management's opinion, the borrower is unlikely to meet its contractual obligations. When loans are placed on non-performing status, all previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed against current interest income. Cash receipts of interest on non-performing loans are recognized either as interest income or as a reduction of principal, based on management's judgment as to the ultimate collectibility of principal. Generally, a non-performing loan may be returned to performing status when all contractual amounts due are reasonably assured of repayment within a reasonable period and the borrower shows sustained repayment performance, in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or when the loan has become well-secured and is in the process of collection. (B) For smaller-balance consumer loans included in CFS loans, management establishes reserves it believes to be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the portfolio. Generally, these loans are written off in full when an impairment is determined or when the loan becomes 120 or 180 days past due, depending on loan type. -7-
