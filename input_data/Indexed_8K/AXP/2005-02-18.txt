Item 8.01 Other Events On February 17, 2005, the New Hampshire Bureau of Securities Regulation filed a petition against American Express Financial Advisors ("AEFA"). The petition alleges that AEFA violated New Hampshire and federal securities laws by failing to disclose revenue sharing and directed brokerage payments received from non-proprietary mutual funds for agreeing to make their products available through AEFA's national distribution network. The petition also alleges that AEFA failed to disclose incentives for advisors to sell proprietary products and other alleged conflicts of interest. The petition seeks, among other things, an order to show cause why AEFA's broker-dealer license should not be denied, suspended or revoked, a proposed fine and restitution of financial planning fees during the relevant period (principally 1999 to 2003) in the amount of $17.5 million, and disgorgement of revenue sharing and directed brokerage payments and other relief. AEFA intends to cooperate fully in this matter.
