Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure American Express Company (the "Company") is reporting in this filing that the broker-dealer subsidiary of its American Express Financial Advisors operating segment ("AEFA") has entered into an agreement with the NASD to settle alleged violations of NASD rules arising from the sale to AEFA customers of Class B (i.e., no front end load) mutual fund shares between January 1, 2002 and July 31, 2003. AEFA's agreement with the NASD is one of several that the NASD has entered into with certain brokerage firms regarding allegedly inappropriate sales of Class B shares. Under the terms of the settlement, AEFA has consented to the payment of a fine to the NASD in the amount of $13 million. The Company established reserves in prior quarters to cover the payment of the fine. AEFA has also agreed to offer certain customers who purchased Class B shares in any fund family from January 1, 2002 through the date of the settlement and continue to hold such shares the option of converting their Class B shares into a number of Class A shares equal to (x) the number of Class A shares that the customer could have purchased on the date(s) that they purchased their Class B shares plus (y) any shares reflecting reinvestment of dividends. AEFA has agreed to pay cash to certain customers who have sold a portion or all of their Class B shares in order to put them into substantially the same financial position (based on actual fund performance and redemption value) in which such customers would have been had the customers purchased Class A shares instead of Class B shares.
