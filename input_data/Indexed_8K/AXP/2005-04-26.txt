2 New York - April 26, 2005 - AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY today reported record net income of $946 million for the first quarter, up 19 percent from $794 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) rose to $0.75, up 23 percent from $0.61 a year ago. Income before last year's accounting change rose 9 percent, while diluted EPS before last year's accounting change was up 14 percent. The company's 2005 return on equity was 22.8 percent. Consolidated revenues rose 10 percent to $7.6 billion, up from $6.9 billion a year ago. This growth reflects strong cardmember spending, increased cards-in-force, higher net yields on the lending portfolio and higher net investment income. Consolidated expenses totaled $6.2 billion, up 9 percent from $5.7 billion a year ago. This increase primarily reflects higher expenses for marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services and human resources. "We generated record earnings again this quarter, driven by strong growth in our card businesses," said Kenneth I. Chenault, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Spending on American Express cards rose among consumers, small businesses and corporate clients. Business volumes from our bank partners were excellent and we signed new partners to our network, including the U.S. wealth management group of UBS. We also continued to expand the global network where American Express cards are welcomed and strengthened long-term relationships with key merchants. "Spending by our cardmembers grew at double-digit rates and, based on preliminary U.S. volume reports, we continued to outpace our major competitors. Credit quality remained excellent during the quarter. "We made substantial investments in brand-related marketing programs and have a strong pipeline of new card products and service enhancements for later this year. Our focus is on building customized rewards, service enhancements and marketing programs that will continue to build business with high-spending cardmembers for our merchant partners.
3 "We are on track with plans to spin off American Express Financial Advisors to our shareholders and recognized some of the initial expenses associated with this transaction during the quarter." FIRST QUARTER 2005 RESULTS First quarter revenues reflected 11 percent growth at Travel Related Services (TRS) and 8 percent growth at American Express Financial Advisors (AEFA), while revenues at American Express Bank (AEB) were slightly lower. More specifically: o Discount revenue rose 13 percent, resulting from a 15 percent increase in cardmember spending on American Express cards. o Net securitization income rose 38 percent, primarily reflecting improved yields and higher average securitized loan balances. o Net investment income rose 8 percent, reflecting higher asset levels. o Net finance charge revenue increased 9 percent, principally as a result of higher net interest yields and growth in average cardmember loan balances. First quarter expenses reflected increases of 8 percent at TRS and 15 percent at AEFA, while AEB's expenses were essentially flat. More specifically, the overall increase reflected: o A 30 percent increase in marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses, primarily due to a 29 percent increase at TRS. o A 12 percent increase in human resources expenses driven by higher management incentives, including the impact of an additional year of incremental stock-based compensation expenses, merit increases and increased employee benefits costs. These items were partially offset by lower other operating expenses.
4 In February, the company announced plans to spin off American Express Financial Advisors. Spin-off related costs during the first quarter totaled $22 million. The transaction is expected to occur in the third quarter and is intended to take place as a tax-free dividend to shareholders. TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES (TRS) reported record first quarter net income of $801 million, up 20 percent from $665 million a year ago. The following discussion of first quarter results presents TRS segment results on a "managed basis," as if there had been no cardmember lending securitization transactions. This is the basis used by management to evaluate operations and is consistent with industry practice. For further information about managed basis and reconciliation of GAAP and managed TRS information, see the "Managed Basis" section below. The AEFA, AEB and Corporate and Other sections below are presented on a GAAP basis. Total net revenues for the first quarter increased 9 percent over the year-ago period to $5.8 billion, reflecting continued strong growth in spending and borrowing on American Express Cards. Discount revenue grew 13 percent, primarily reflecting a 15 percent increase in billed business. This increase was driven by 10 percent growth in spending per basic cardmember, the continued benefits of rewards programs and the net addition of 4.5 million cards-in-force. Spending on cards issued by the company's network partners increased more than 35 percent from a year ago. The benefits of overall higher cardmember spending were partially offset by a slightly lower average discount rate that reflected the continuing change in the mix of business toward the retail and everyday spending categories. Net finance charge revenue increased 6 percent, primarily reflecting higher net interest yields and 4 percent growth in average worldwide lending balances. Other commissions and fees increased 9 percent due to greater card-related volumes. Net card fees rose 6 percent, primarily as a result of 7 percent growth in cards-in-force.
5 Total expenses increased 6 percent. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses increased 29 percent, reflecting both higher marketing and promotion expenses and greater rewards costs. The increase in marketing expenses was primarily driven by the company's recent global brand advertising campaign and the continued focus on business-building initiatives. Human resources expenses increased 7 percent, largely due to higher management incentives, including an additional year of incremental stock-based compensation expenses, increased employee benefits costs and merit increases. Credit quality remained strong in both the charge card and lending portfolios. The total provision for losses declined 6 percent as a 12 percent decrease in the lending provision was partially offset by a 9 percent volume-driven increase in the charge card provision. Reserve coverage ratios remained strong, reflecting excellent credit performance and the company's view of the environment. Charge card interest expense increased 5 percent due to higher average receivable balances and increased funding costs. Other operating expenses decreased 24 percent, primarily reflecting lower expenses as a result of the third quarter 2004 sale of the ATM business, a positive change in reserves resulting from various control improvements and reduced printing and supplies expenses. AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS (AEFA) reported first quarter net income of $166 million, up 5 percent from $157 million a year ago. Income before last year's accounting change was down 27 percent from $228 million a year ago. Total revenues increased 8 percent. Net investment income increased 12 percent from year-ago levels, reflecting higher levels of invested assets. In addition, the prior year period was negatively impacted by a decision to further improve AEFA's portfolio risk profile by liquidating a structured investment before maturity resulting in a $49 million charge ($32 million after-tax). Investment
6 management and service fees increased 5 percent, reflecting higher levels of assets under management due to higher average equity values and net asset inflows. Property-casualty insurance premiums rose 20 percent from last year, reflecting a 17 percent increase in the average number of policies in-force generated, most notably from the Costco relationship. Other revenues increased 22 percent, benefiting from higher fees earned on non-proprietary funds as well as financial planning and advice services. Total expenses increased 15 percent as a result of higher human resources costs, provisions for losses and benefits, deferred acquisition costs (DAC) amortization and other operating expenses. Total human resources expenses rose 14 percent from year-ago levels, primarily due to higher performance-related incentives at Threadneedle and AEFA spin-off related costs. Provisions for losses and benefits increased 10 percent, largely due to higher interest crediting rates and volume growth on certificate products. DAC amortization expense increased two-fold, primarily reflecting a year-ago benefit of $66 million ($43 million after-tax) related to the lengthening of the amortization periods for certain insurance and annuity products in conjunction with the adoption of SOP 03-1. Other operating expenses increased 9 percent, primarily reflecting higher advertising and promotion expenses, as well as costs related to various securities industry regulatory matters, which totaled $35 million (after-tax), up from $11 million (after-tax) a year ago. AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK (AEB) reported first quarter net income of $30 million, which was flat compared with the year-ago period. The results reflected higher commissions and fees in Private Banking and the Financial Institutions Group, the impact of restructuring costs in the year-ago period and a lower effective tax rate. These benefits were offset by lower net interest income and higher operating expenses.
7 CORPORATE AND OTHER reported first quarter net expenses of $51 million, compared with $58 million a year ago. The results primarily reflected lower net interest expense. ***
8 MANAGED BASIS - TRS Managed basis means the presentation assumes there have been no securitization transactions, i.e. all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the company's balance sheet and income statements, respectively. The company presents TRS information on a managed basis because that is the way the company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Asset securitization is just one of several ways for the company to fund cardmember loans. Use of a managed basis presentation, including non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans, presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business, avoiding distortions due to the mix of funding sources at any particular point in time. For example, irrespective of the funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics, such as changes in delinquencies and write-off rates, for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue and changes in market share, which are all significant metrics in evaluating the company's performance and which can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The Consolidated Section of this press release and attachments provide the GAAP presentation for items described on a managed basis. ***

(Preliminary) TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION (Unaudited) Quarters Ended March 31, (Millions) Securitization income, net includes non-credit provision components of the net gains and charges from securitization activities, related impairment charges, if any, of the related interest-only strip, excess spread related to securitized cardmember loans, net finance charge revenue on retained interests in securitized cardmember loans and servicing income, net of related discounts or fees. Management views any net gains from securitizations as discretionary benefits to be used for card acquisition expenses, which are reflected in both marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses and other operating expenses. Consequently, the managed Selected Financial Information above for the quarters ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 assumes that the impact of this net activity was offset by higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses of $4 million and $4 million, respectively, and other operating expenses of $2 million and $4 million, respectively. Accordingly, the incremental expenses, as well as the impact of this net activity, have been eliminated. -9-

EXHIBIT 99.3 [LOGO OF AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY] 2005 First Quarter Earnings Supplement The enclosed summary should be read in conjunction with the text and statistical tables included in American Express Company's (the "Company" or "AXP") First Quarter 2005 Earnings Release. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This presentation contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of the date on which they are made. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, including the Company's financial and other goals, are set forth on pages 71-73 in the Company's 2004 Annual Report to Shareholders and in its 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and other reports, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2005 HIGHLIGHTS o First quarter diluted EPS of $0.75 increased 23% versus $0.61 last year on a net income basis, and increased 14% over diluted EPS of $0.66 before last year's accounting change. Total revenues rose 10%. For the trailing 12 months, ROE was 23%. - 1Q `05 included: -- $22MM ($14MM after-tax) of expenses related to AEFA spin-off activities (see discussion on page 2); -- $21MM ($15MM after-tax) of charges recorded in connection with initiatives relating principally to the continuation of the restructuring of TRS' Business Travel operations and reengineering of certain functions within the Company's finance operations; -- A $35MM pre-tax and after-tax expense related to securities industry regulatory matters at AEFA; and -- $10MM ($7MM after-tax) of net investment gains at AEFA. - 1Q '04 included: -- The adoption of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 03-1 ("SOP 03-1") resulting in a below-the-line, non-cash charge at AEFA of $71MM after-tax; -- A Deferred Acquisition Cost ("DAC") valuation benefit at AEFA of $66MM ($43MM after-tax) reflecting the lengthening of amortization periods for certain insurance and annuity products in conjunction with the adoption of SOP 03-1. Within the consolidated income statement, $44MM of the $66MM benefit was recorded in human resources expense and $22MM was recorded in other operating expenses. Within AEFA's income statement these are reflected within the DAC costs. -- $38MM ($25MM after-tax) of net investment losses at AEFA; -- $17MM ($11MM after-tax) of costs at AEFA related to securities industry regulatory matters; and -- $11MM ($8MM after-tax) of costs, at AEB reflecting decisions to further rationalize certain Asian and New York activities. o Compared with the first quarter of 2004: - Worldwide billed business increased 15% on continued strong consumer, small business and Corporate Services spending growth and over 35% growth in global network partner volumes. A comparatively weaker U.S. dollar benefited the reported worldwide growth rate by 1%. -- Worldwide average spending per proprietary basic card in force increased 10% versus last year (up 9% adjusted for foreign exchange translation); - TRS' worldwide lending balances of $25.9B on an owned basis increased 6%; on a managed basis, worldwide lending balances of $46.3B were up 3%. Excluding the 4Q '04 sale of TRS' equipment leasing product line, managed loans increased 7% (see discussion of "managed basis" on page 6); - Card credit quality continued to be well-controlled and reserve coverage ratios remained strong; - Worldwide cards in force of 66.1MM increased 7%, up 4.5MM from last year and 0.7MM during 1Q `05, on continued proprietary and network card growth; and - AEFA assets owned, managed and administered of $406B were up 7% versus last year reflecting market appreciation, favorable foreign currency translation impacts and asset inflows. o Additional items of note included: - Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services costs increased 30% versus 1Q '04 reflecting substantially higher marketing and promotion expenses and greater rewards costs. Marketing expenses rose primarily due to costs related to the Company's ongoing global "My Life, My Card(SM)" advertising campaign and various business building initiatives. Rewards costs increased, reflecting strong volume growth, a higher redemption rate, and the continued increase in cardmember loyalty program participation. The strong metric performance during the quarter reflected the ongoing benefits of the increased spending over the last two years. - The Company's reengineering initiatives are on track to deliver $1B of additional benefits this year, including significant carry-over benefits from certain initiatives begun in prior periods. During the first quarter, reengineering initiatives continued to provide substantial year-over-year expense comparison benefits. In addition, revenue-related reengineering activities are driving a significant portion of the total benefits, representing more than 25% of the benefits delivered in 1Q '05. - As previously disclosed, the Company decided to expense stock options beginning in 1Q '03 and use restricted stock awards in place of stock options for middle management. As a result, the 1Q `05 impacts of incremental annual option grant expense, increased levels of restricted stock awards and other related compensation changes contributed to the 12% increase in human resources expense. -- Compared with last year, the total employee count of 76,900 decreased 2%; compared with last quarter, the employee count was down 600 employees, or approximately 1%. - 1 -
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2005 HIGHLIGHTS (Cont'd) o On February 1, 2005, the Company announced its intention to pursue a spin-off of its AEFA operating unit to shareholders. In the transaction, American Express shareholders would receive 100 percent of the common shares of American Express Financial Corporation ("AEFC"), the wholly-owned subsidiary that directly and through its subsidiaries and affiliates conducts our AEFA business. The transaction is intended to be tax-free to shareholders and is expected to be completed late in the third quarter of 2005, subject to certain conditions. At the time of the spin-off, the Company intends to provide additional capital to AEFC that will enable it to achieve a senior debt rating that permits it efficient access to the capital markets. Additionally, we intend that AEFA's insurance business will be capitalized in a manner that would confirm its current financial strength ratings. The Company also anticipates that it will incur spin-off related expenses associated with establishing an independent company. In the first quarter, these expenses totaled approximately $22MM on a pre-tax basis. As previously indicated, these expenses, cumulatively, will be significant. These transitional operating expenses will be reflected in each quarter as incurred. o During the quarter, American Express continued to invest in growth opportunities through expanded products and services. - At TRS we: -- Launched the American Express Aeromexico Card, the first cobrand credit card issued by American Express in Mexico; -- Introduced a new Platinum Credit Card in Hong Kong, specifically targeted towards the emerging affluent market and the first Platinum card product in this market available by application; -- Expanded our GNS business through: - An agreement with Union Bank of Switzerland ("UBS") and Juniper Bank, announced on April 21, to issue American Express charge cards to UBS wealth management clients, as part of UBS' Resource Management Account(R) ("RMA") services. The card will be directly linked to the RMA account and will have its own, UBS administered, rewards program. - An agreement with the Russian Standard Bank, announced on April 5, to exclusively issue and market Russian ruble- or U.S. dollar-denominated American Express Card products in Russia; and - The launch of the first Baiduri American Express cards in Brunei, through the Company's network relationship with the Baiduri Bank; -- Expanded our merchant coverage with the announcement of a strategic partnership for nationwide card acceptance with Regis Corporation, an industry leader in the hair service business which operates several name-brand hair salons nationwide; -- Partnered through OPEN: The Small Business Network(SM) with Count-Me-In and Women's Leadership Exchange Team to commence the national award program for women entrepreneurs, providing loans, networking, and coaching to founding women in business; -- Provided Centurion(R) members with access to Exclusive Resorts, LLC, with over 150 multi-million dollar residences in nearly 30 of the top global destinations; -- Relaunched Blue PLAY(R), a real-time, online auction site allowing Blue from American Express Cardmembers to use Membership Rewards(R) points to bid for once-in-a-lifetime experiences, show tickets, vacation packages, or film premieres; -- Expanded U.S. cardmember travel services with the introduction of two new products, Global Travel Shield and Visa & Passport, which provide door-to-door travel insurance products and expedite overseas travel documentation processes; and -- Added the Travel Authority, Inc., a regional travel management company serving individual, corporate and group travelers with a broad spectrum of travel services in over 58 locations, to the growing U.S. Representative Travel Network. - At AEFA we: -- Received the 2005 Lipper Fund Award for the Diversified Equity Income Fund (Y share) class performance as the leading fund in its Lipper equity income category for the three-year period ended December 31, 2004. - 2 -
o NET INCOME: Increased 19% to a record quarterly level of $946MM. Income before last year's accounting change increased 9%. - 1Q `05 included: -- $22MM ($14MM after-tax) of expenses related to AEFA spin-off activities; -- $21MM ($15MM after-tax) of charges recorded in connection with initiatives relating principally to the continuation of the restructuring of TRS' Business Travel operations and reengineering of certain functions within the Company's finance operations; -- A $35MM pre-tax and after-tax expense related to securities industry regulatory matters at AEFA; and -- $10MM ($7MM after-tax) of net investment gains at AEFA. - 1Q `04 included: -- The adoption of SOP 03-1 resulting in a below-the-line non-cash charge at AEFA of $71MM; -- A DAC valuation benefit at AEFA of $66MM ($43MM after-tax) reflecting the lengthening of amortization periods for certain insurance and annuity products in conjunction with the adoption of SOP 03-1. Of the $66MM benefit, $44MM was recorded in human resources expense and $22MM was recorded in other operating expenses within the above income statement; -- $38MM ($25MM after-tax) of net investment losses at AEFA; -- $17MM ($11MM after-tax) of costs at AEFA related to securities industry regulatory matters; and -- $11MM ($8MM after-tax) of costs at AEB reflecting the decision to further rationalize certain Asian and New York activities. - 3 -
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED (Cont'd) o CONSOLIDATED REVENUES: Revenues increased 10% due to higher discount revenues, increased net securitization income, higher net investment income, higher Cardmember lending net finance charge revenue, increased other commissions and fees, greater insurance and annuity revenues, larger net card fees, higher management and distribution fees, and greater other revenues. Consolidated revenue growth versus last year reflected 11% growth at TRS, 8% growth at AEFA, and a 1% decline at AEB. Translation of foreign currency revenues contributed approximately 1% of the 10% revenue growth rate. o CONSOLIDATED EXPENSES: Expenses were up 9%, reflecting higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses, greater human resources costs, greater provision for losses and benefits, and increased interest expense, which were partially offset by lower other operating expenses. Consolidated expenses reflected increases versus last year of 8% at TRS and 15% at AEFA, and a decrease of 1% at AEB. Translation of foreign currency expenses contributed approximately 1% of the 9% expense growth rate. o PRE-TAX MARGIN: Was 18.2% in 1Q '05 compared with 15.2% in 4Q '04 and 18.1% in 1Q '04. o EFFECTIVE TAX RATE: Was 31% in 1Q '05 and 1Q '04 versus 24% in 4Q '04. - In 4Q `04, the effective tax rate reflected the impact of the benefits from the changes in the international funding strategy at TRS, favorable tax audit experience at both TRS and AEB, and a favorable adjustment to the current taxes payable account at AEFA. o SHARE REPURCHASES: During 1Q '05, 12.3MM shares were repurchased. Repurchases during 1Q '05 reflect a more measured strategy towards repurchase activity as we finalize the capital implications of the anticipated spin-off of AEFA. Since the inception of repurchase programs in September 1994, 507.8MM shares have been acquired under cumulative Board authorizations to repurchase up to 570MM shares, including purchases made under agreements with third parties. CORPORATE AND OTHER o The net expense was $51MM in 1Q '05 compared with $57MM in 4Q '04 and $58MM in 1Q '04. The lower level of expenses in the quarter primarily reflects lower net interest expense, partially offset by $3MM of spin-off related costs. - 4 -
o NET INCOME: Increased 20%. o PRE-TAX MARGIN: Was 21.0% in 1Q '05 versus 17.6% in 4Q '04 and 19.3% in 1Q '04. o EFFECTIVE TAX RATE: Was 32% in 1Q '05 and 1Q '04, compared with 28% in 4Q '04. During 1Q '05, benefits from the changes in TRS' international funding strategy continued to positively affect the rate; however, they were offset by higher accruals of foreign and state taxes as well as a reduction in the relative benefit from tax-exempt interest. In 4Q '04 the rate reflected the funding benefits, in addition to favorable tax audit experience. o GAAP BASIS INCOME STATEMENT ITEMS: - SECURITIZATION INCOME, NET: Increased 38% on a greater average balance of securitized loans, a higher portfolio yield and a decrease in portfolio write-offs, partially offset by greater interest expense due to a higher coupon rate paid to certificate holders. Securitization income, net represents the non-credit provision components of the net gains and charges from securitization activities, the amortization and related impairment charges, if any, of the related interest-only strip, excess spread related to securitized loans, net finance charge revenue on retained interests in securitized loans, and servicing income, net of related discounts or fees. -- During 1Q '05 and 1Q '04, TRS' results reflect net securitization gains, including the credit components, of $6MM ($4MM after-tax) and $8MM ($5MM after-tax), respectively. Net securitization gains include interest-only strip adjustments. The average balance of Cardmember lending securitizations was $20.1B in 1Q '05, compared with $19.6B in 1Q '04. - NET FINANCE CHARGE REVENUE: Increased 9%, reflecting 5% growth in the average balance of the owned lending portfolio and a higher portfolio yield. - LENDING PROVISION: Increased 3% on growth in the average owned portfolio and maturities of $1B in 1Q `05 of previously securitized balances. - The above GAAP basis items relating to net finance charge revenue and lending provision reflect the owned portfolio only. "Owned basis" credit quality statistics are available in the First Quarter 2005 Earnings Release on the TRS Selected Statistical Information pages. - 5 -
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES (Cont'd) SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - MANAGED BASIS: The following supplemental table includes information on both a GAAP basis and a managed basis. The managed basis presentation assumes there have been no securitization transactions, i.e., as if all securitized Cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected in the Company's balance sheet and income statement, respectively. The Company presents TRS information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that the trends in the Company's Cardmember lending business are more accurately portrayed by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized Cardmember loans. Asset securitization is just one of several ways the Company funds Cardmember loans. Use of a managed basis presentation, including non-securitized and securitized Cardmember loans, presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the Cardmember lending business, avoiding distortions due to the mix of funding sources at any particular point in time. For example, irrespective of the mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics, such as changes in delinquencies and write-off rates, for the entire Cardmember lending portfolio because it is more representative of the economics of the aggregate Cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of Cardmember loans and related revenue and changes in market share, which are significant metrics in evaluating the Company's performance and which can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized Cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. Management views any net gains from securitizations as discretionary benefits to be used for card acquisition expenses, which are reflected in both marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services and other operating expenses. Consequently, the managed basis presentation assumes the impact of this net activity was offset by higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses of $4MM in both 1Q '05 and 1Q '04 and other operating expenses of $2MM in 1Q '05 and $4MM in 1Q '04. Accordingly, the incremental expenses, as well as the impact of the net lending securitization activity, are eliminated. The following table compares and reconciles the GAAP basis TRS income statements to the managed basis information, where different. - 6 -
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES (Cont'd) The following discussion addresses results on a managed basis. o Managed basis net revenue rose 9% from higher discount revenue, higher net finance charge revenue and greater other commissions and fees. o The 6% higher managed basis expenses reflect substantially higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services costs, greater human resources expenses, larger occupancy and equipment costs, and increased professional services expenses, partially offset by lower other operating expenses and reduced provisions for losses. o DISCOUNT REVENUE: A 15% increase in billed business, partially offset by a lower discount rate, yielded a 13% increase in discount revenue. - The average discount rate was 2.56% in 1Q '05 versus 2.54% in 4Q '04 and 2.59% in 1Q '04. The decrease versus last year primarily reflects changes in the mix of spending between various merchant segments due to the cumulative impact of stronger than average growth in the lower rate retail and other "everyday spend" merchant categories (e.g., supermarkets, discounters, etc.). The increase versus last quarter reflects the impact of seasonal effects on the mix of spending. -- We believe the AXP value proposition is strong. However, as indicated in prior quarters, continued changes in the mix of business, volume-related pricing discounts and selective repricing initiatives will probably continue to result in some erosion of the average discount rate over time. - BILLED BUSINESS: The 15% increase in worldwide billed business reflected a 10% increase in spending per proprietary basic card and 7% growth in cards in force. -- U.S. billed business was up 14% reflecting growth of 13% within our consumer card business, a 17% increase in small business spending and 7% improvement in Corporate Services volumes. - Spending per proprietary basic card in force increased 7%. -- U.S. non-T&E-related volume categories (which represented approximately 66% of 1Q `05 U.S. billed business) grew 17%, while T&E volumes rose 8%. -- U.S. airline-related volume, which represented approximately 11% of total U.S. volumes during the quarter, rose 3% as 15% transaction volume growth was suppressed by a 10% lower average airline charge. -- Excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation: - Worldwide billed business and spending per proprietary basic card in force increased 14% and 9%, respectively. - Total billed business outside the U.S. reflected mid-teens proprietary growth in Latin America and Canada and high single-digit growth in Europe and Asia. - Within our proprietary business, billed business outside the U.S. reflected 11% growth in consumer and small business spending, as well as within Corporate Services volumes. - Spending per proprietary basic card in force outside the U.S. rose 12%. -- Global Network Services volumes rose in excess of 35% on continued strong growth in non-U.S. partner volume and the addition of MBNA-related volumes in the U.S. -- Worldwide airline volumes, which represented approximately 13% of total volumes during the quarter, increased 9% on 14% growth in transaction volume, partially offset by a decrease in the average airline charge of 5%. - 7 -
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES (Cont'd) o BILLED BUSINESS (cont'd): - CARDS IN FORCE: Rose 7% worldwide versus last year on continued strong card acquisitions and improved average customer retention levels within our proprietary issuing business, as well as growth in network cards. -- U.S. cards in force rose 400K during the quarter. -- Outside the United States, 300K cards in force were added during the quarter. o NET FINANCE CHARGE REVENUE: Increased 6% on 4% growth in average worldwide lending balances and a higher portfolio yield. - The yield on the worldwide portfolio was 8.8% in 1Q '05 versus 8.5% in 4Q '04 and 8.7% in 1Q '04. The increase versus last year and last quarter reflects a lower proportion of the U.S. portfolio on introductory rates and increased finance charge rates, partially offset by rising funding costs. o NET CARD FEES: Rose 6% due to higher cards in force. The average annual fee of $35 per proprietary card in force remained constant in 1Q '05, 4Q '04 and 1Q '04. o TRAVEL COMMISSIONS AND FEES: Increased 1% on a 5% increase in travel sales, which was partially offset by lower transaction fees as a greater proportion of bookings were made on-line. o OTHER COMMISSIONS AND FEES: Increased 9% on greater volume-related foreign exchange conversion fees, higher card-related fees and assessments, and larger network partner-related fees. o TC INVESTMENT INCOME: Increased 1% on higher average investments and a lower investment yield. TC sales decreased 4% versus last year due to sales declines in the U.S. and Europe, partially driven by transition to plastic-based gift and travel pre-paid products which were partially offset by growth in Latin American sales. o OTHER REVENUES: Rose 2% as higher insurance premiums and greater merchant-related revenues were largely offset by lower ATM revenues resulting from the 3Q `04 sale of the remaining portion of the ATM business. o MARKETING, PROMOTION, REWARDS AND CARDMEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES: Increased 29%, reflecting substantially higher marketing and promotion expenses and greater rewards costs. The increase in marketing and promotion expenses is primarily due to the Company's ongoing global brand advertising campaign and our continued focus on business-building initiatives. The growth in rewards costs is attributable to strong volume growth, a higher redemption rate and the continued increase in cardmember loyalty program participation. o CHARGE CARD INTEREST EXPENSE: Rose 5% due to greater average cardmember receivable balances and a higher effective cost of funds. o HUMAN RESOURCES EXPENSE: Increased 7% due to greater management incentive expenses, larger employee benefit costs, merit increases and $10MM of restructuring costs related to the rationalization of Business Travel operations. - The employee count at 3/05 of 64,500 was down 700 versus 12/04 and down 1,700 versus 3/04. o PROFESSIONAL SERVICES EXPENSES: Rose 3% primarily due to increased technology costs related to higher business and service-related volumes. o OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES: Decreased 24% primarily reflecting lower expenses as a result of our 3Q '04 sale of the ATM business, a positive change in reserves resulting from various control improvements and reduced printing and supplies expenses. - 8 -
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES (Cont'd) o CREDIT QUALITY: - Overall credit quality continued to perform exceptionally well. - The provision for losses on charge card products increased 9%, as higher volumes were partially offset by a lower provision rate. - The lending provision for losses was down 12% versus last year, despite growth in loans outstanding, due to well-controlled credit. - Reserve coverage ratios, which are well in excess of 100% of past due balances, remained strong. - WORLDWIDE CHARGE CARD:* -- The net loss ratio declined versus last year and last quarter; the past due rate improved versus last year, but increased versus last quarter, consistent with seasonal patterns. -- Reserve coverage of past due accounts remained strong. - WORLDWIDE LENDING:** -- The write-off rate improved versus last year and held steady versus last quarter. Past due rates declined versus last year, but rose versus last quarter consistent with seasonal patterns. -- Coverage of past due accounts was maintained at a conservative level despite a decline in the reserve balance. * There are no off-balance sheet Charge Card securitizations. Therefore, "Owned basis" and "Managed basis" credit quality statistics for the Charge Card portfolio are the same. ** As previously described, this information is presented on a "Managed basis". "Owned basis" credit quality statistics are available in the First Quarter 2005 Earnings Release on the TRS Selected Statistical Information pages. Credit trends are generally consistent under both reporting methods. - 9 -
o NET INCOME: Increased 5%; however, decreased 27% before last year's accounting change, principally due to last year's above-the-line, $43MM after-tax benefit from the adoption of SOP 03-1. - 1Q `05 included: -- $20MM ($13MM after-tax) of expenses related to AEFA spin-off activities; -- A$35MM pre-tax and after-tax expense related to securities industry regulatory matters; and -- $10MM ($7MM after-tax) of net investment gains. - 1Q `04 included: -- The below-the-line, non-cash charge of $71MM after-tax from the adoption of SOP 03-1; -- A DAC valuation benefit of $66MM ($43MM after-tax) reflecting the lengthening of amortization periods for certain insurance and annuity products in conjunction with the adoption of SOP 03-1; -- $38MM ($25MM after-tax) of net investment losses; and -- $17MM ($11MM after-tax) of costs related to securities industry regulatory matters. o REVENUES: Increased 8% due to: - Increased net investment income; - Greater investment management and service fees; - Increased other revenues, driven by higher fees earned on non-proprietary funds and growth in financial planning and advice services fees; and - Higher insurance-related revenues. o PRE-TAX MARGIN: Was 12.6% in 1Q `05 compared with 13.4% in 4Q '04 and 18.3% in 1Q `04. o EFFECTIVE TAX RATE: Was 29% in 1Q `05 versus 12% in 4Q '04 and 28% in 1Q '04. In 4Q '04, the effective tax rate reflected a $33MM favorable adjustment to the current taxes payable account. - 10 -

Branded advisor-generated sales increased 9% on a cash basis and remained flat on the internally used "gross dealer concession" (GDC) basis, a commonly used financial services industry measure of the sales production of the advisor channel. - Total mutual fund cash sales were flat as proprietary sales declined, while non-proprietary sales rose versus last year.

The number of financial plans sold rose 6% compared to 1Q `04. o PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES AND BENEFITS: - INTEREST CREDITED ON ANNUITIES AND UNIVERSAL LIFE-TYPE CONTRACTS: Decreased 3% primarily due to lower interest crediting rates on our annuity products and the effect of depreciation in the S&P 500 on equity indexed annuities this year versus appreciation last year, partially offset by higher life insurance in force levels and annuity accumulation values. - BENEFITS ON INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES: Increased 13% due to higher life and disability insurance in force levels and higher annuity levels, partially offset by changes made to the benefit ratios which are used to estimate the cost of certain variable annuity guarantee features. - INTEREST CREDITED ON INVESTMENT CERTIFICATES: Rose 72% on higher average reserves and higher interest crediting rates. - LOSSES AND EXPENSES ON PROPERTY-CASUALTY INSURANCE: Grew 19% as a result of higher average policies in force. o HUMAN RESOURCES EXPENSE - FIELD: Increased 8% reflecting spin-off related costs, higher assets per advisor and growth in the advisor force. - TOTAL ADVISOR FORCE: Grew to 12,356 at 3/05, up 286 advisors or 2% versus 3/04 and up 12 advisors versus 12/04 despite typical seasonal pressures in the first quarter. -- Veteran advisor retention rates remain strong. -- Total production and advisor productivity declined versus last quarter reflecting the market environment, typical seasonal pressures in the first quarter, as well as expected initial spin-off related distractions that accompany an announcement of this kind. March production levels improved as spin-off related uncertainty seemed to wane. - The total number of clients was flat versus last quarter as we focused on high value client acquisition activities and purged inactive accounts during 3Q '04. When compared to the first quarter last year, client acquisitions rose 1% and average assets per client were up 10%. Client retention was 93%. o HUMAN RESOURCES EXPENSE - NON-FIELD: Increased 22% reflecting performance-related incentives at Threadneedle, higher benefit and management incentive costs and merit increases. The average number of non-field employees was relatively unchanged versus 1Q `04. o AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS: Doubled, primarily due to last year's $66MM benefit reflecting the lengthening of amortization periods for certain insurance and annuity products in conjunction with the adoption of SOP 03-1. o OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES: Increased 9%, primarily reflecting higher advertising and promotion expenses, greater costs related to securities industry regulatory matters and spin-off related costs. - 12 -
o NET INCOME: Decreased 1% as lower net revenues and higher human resources and other operating expenses were partially offset by lower reengineering-related costs and a lower effective tax rate. - 1Q '04 included $11MM ($8MM after-tax) of reengineering costs, $9MM of which reflects a restructuring charge related to the exit of businesses in Pakistan and Bangladesh, and $2MM of which is related to ongoing reengineering activities. o NET REVENUES: Declined 1%. - Net interest income decreased 9% as lower spreads in the investment portfolio were partially offset by higher Private Banking volumes. - Commissions and fees increased 5% due to higher volumes in the Financial Institutions Group ("FIG") and Private Banking. - Foreign Exchange Income and other revenues rose 3% primarily due to a small gain on the sale of the Luxembourg Private Banking business. o HUMAN RESOURCES EXPENSE: Was up 8% reflecting merit increases and higher management incentive costs, partially offset by the benefits of reengineering initiatives. o OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES: Increased 5% due to higher business volume-related expenses, partially offset by the benefits of reengineering initiatives. o PROVISION FOR LOSSES: Decreased 19% or $1MM, due to a Corporate Banking recovery. o PRE-TAX MARGIN: Was 22.2% in 1Q `05 versus 3.4% (20.3% before restructuring charges) in 4Q '04 and 22.9% in 1Q '04 (27.1% before restructuring charges). o EFFECTIVE TAX RATE: Was 35% in 1Q `05 versus 14% in 4Q '04 and 38% in 1Q `04. - 4Q '04 reflects the impact of recurring non-taxable items on the Bank's lower level of pre-tax income, plus a favorable state tax adjustment arising from the conclusion of an outstanding tax audit. - 13 -

bankruptcies, restructurings or similar events affecting the airline or any other industry representing a significant portion of TRS' billed business, including any potential negative effect on particular card products and services and billed business generally that could result from the actual or perceived weakness of key business partners in such industries;
