Explanatory Note The Registrant filed a Current Report on Form 8-K dated November 22, 2004, which report was amended by a report on Form 8-K/A dated December 8, 2004, to report the decision of the American Express Company Audit Committee to replace the auditors of the American Express Incentive Savings Plan. This amendment to that filing is being filed to update the information as of the filing of the Plan's Annual Report on Form 11-K. Item 4.01 Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant. On November 22, 2004, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of American Express Company appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as the independent registered public accountants ("auditors") for the American Express Incentive Savings Plan (the "Plan") for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2005 and dismissed Ernst & Young LLP ("E&Y") as the Plan's auditors for the 2005 fiscal year. E&Y has completed its engagement as the Plan's auditors for the 2004 fiscal year. E&Y's reports on the Plan's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. In connection with the audits of the Plan's financial statements for each of the two fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 and through the date hereof, there were no disagreements between the Registrant and E&Y on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of E&Y, would have caused E&Y to make reference to the matter in their report. During the two most recent fiscal years and through the date hereof, there have been no "reportable events" (as defined in Regulation S-K, Item 304(a)(1)(v)). During the Plan's two most recent fiscal years and through the date hereof, the Registrant did not consult with PwC in respect of the Plan's financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 regarding any of the matters or events set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K. The Registrant has requested E&Y to furnish the Registrant with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the above statements. A copy of E&Y's letter, dated June 16, 2005, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K/A. Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
