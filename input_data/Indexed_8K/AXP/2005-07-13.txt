Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure. As previously disclosed, in February 2005 the New Hampshire Bureau of Securities Regulation ("NHBSR") filed a petition against American Express Company's (the "Company") American Express Financial Advisors ("AEFA") operating segment alleging violations of New Hampshire and federal securities laws by failing to disclose revenue sharing and directed brokerage payments received from non-proprietary mutual funds for AEFA's agreeing to make such funds' products available through AEFA's national distribution network. The petition also alleged that AEFA failed to disclose incentives for advisors to sell proprietary products and other alleged conflicts of interest. The Company is reporting in this filing that AEFA has entered into an agreement with the NHBSR to settle the alleged violations. Under the terms of the settlement, AEFA has consented to the payment of a fine to the NHBSR in the amount of $5 million and agreed to make restitution of up to $2 million. AEFA has also agreed to pay $375,000 for all costs associated with the NHBSR's investigation. The Company established reserves in prior quarters to cover this matter. In addition, under the terms of the settlement, AEFA has agreed to retain a consultant to review its practices and procedures in all its offices located in New Hampshire and to determine the ultimate amount of the restitution to be paid to New Hampshire clients up to the maximum of $2 million.
