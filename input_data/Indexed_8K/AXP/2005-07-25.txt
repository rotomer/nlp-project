2 New York - July 25, 2005 - AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY today reported record net income of $1.0 billion for the second quarter, up 16 percent from $876 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) rose to $0.81, up 19 percent from $0.68 a year ago. The company's return on equity was 23.1 percent. Consolidated revenues rose 11 percent to $8.0 billion, up from $7.2 billion a year ago. This growth reflects record cardmember spending, increased cards-in-force, a rise in cardmember lending balances and higher levels of invested assets. Consolidated expenses totaled $6.7 billion, up 12 percent from $6.0 billion a year ago. This increase primarily reflects higher expenses for human resources, as well as for marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services. Expenses for the 2005 quarter also included costs associated with the planned spin-off of the company's financial services unit. "Strong momentum in our card business and excellent credit quality drove another quarter of record earnings," said Kenneth I. Chenault, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Cardmember spending rose sharply among consumers, small businesses and corporate clients. The volume growth was excellent throughout our card-issuing business and from our bank network partners. This growth in all of our key customer segments produced overall business volumes that once again outpaced our major competitors. "Our investments in new products, rewards and services helped us to generate double-digit growth in average spending per cardmember and add 1.2 million cards in the last three months. The pipeline of new products and service enhancements continues to be excellent and is helping to differentiate American Express as the network of choice for high-spending cardmembers. "Overall results for the quarter demonstrated the competitive advantages and broad-based strength of the businesses that will comprise the company following the spin-off of American Express Financial Advisors. We remain on track with plans for the spin-off, which we expect will occur at the end of the third quarter of 2005."
3 SECOND QUARTER 2005 RESULTS Second quarter revenues reflected 11 percent growth at Travel Related Services (TRS), 10 percent growth at American Express Financial Advisors (AEFA) and a slight increase at American Express Bank (AEB). More specifically: o Discount revenue rose 16 percent, resulting from an 18 percent increase in cardmember spending on American Express cards. o Management and distribution fees increased 12 percent, reflecting higher levels of assets under management and higher fees earned on wrap accounts. o Net finance charge revenue increased 14 percent, principally driven by growth in average cardmember loan balances and higher net interest yields. Second quarter expenses reflected increases of 12 percent at TRS, 17 percent at AEFA and a slight increase at AEB. More specifically, the overall increase reflected: o A 15 percent increase in human resources expenses driven by severance costs associated with the restructuring of certain operations, higher management incentives including the impact of an additional year of incremental stock-based compensation expenses, merit increases and increased employee benefits costs. o An 18 percent increase in marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses, primarily due to an 18 percent increase at TRS. Certain tax and insurance benefits provided the flexibility this quarter to accelerate reengineering initiatives and investments in the business. Second quarter results included the following items:
4 o A tax benefit of approximately $90 million resulting from a Federal tax audit. o A $115 million benefit ($75 million after-tax) related to the settlement of an insurance claim associated with September 11, 2001. o $102 million ($66 million after-tax) of reengineering costs principally related to restructuring costs within the International Payments business, the Corporate Travel business and the Finance and Technologies functions. o $59 million of costs ($38 million after-tax) related to the spin-off of American Express Financial Advisors. o Costs associated with various securities industry legal and regulatory matters of $35 million ($23 million after-tax). TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES (TRS) reported record second quarter net income of $808 million, up 10 percent from $732 million a year ago. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF SECOND QUARTER RESULTS PRESENTS TRS SEGMENT RESULTS ON A "MANAGED BASIS," AS IF THERE HAD BEEN NO CARDMEMBER LENDING SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS. THIS IS THE BASIS USED BY MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE OPERATIONS AND IS CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT MANAGED BASIS AND RECONCILIATION OF GAAP AND MANAGED TRS INFORMATION, SEE THE "MANAGED BASIS" SECTION BELOW. THE AEFA, AEB AND CORPORATE AND OTHER SECTIONS BELOW ARE PRESENTED ON A GAAP BASIS. Total net revenues for the second quarter increased 11 percent from a year ago to $6.2 billion, reflecting continued strong growth in spending and borrowing on American Express Cards. Record cardmember spending contributed to a 16 percent increase in discount revenue. This increase was driven by 13 percent growth in spending per basic cardmember, the continued benefits of rewards programs and the net addition of 4.8 million cards-in-force. Spending on cards issued by the company's network partners increased more than 35% from a year ago.
5 The benefits of overall higher cardmember spending were partially offset by a slightly lower average discount rate that reflected, in part, the continuing change in the mix of business toward the retail and everyday spending categories. Net finance charge revenue increased 10 percent, primarily reflecting 6 percent growth in average worldwide lending balances and higher net interest yields. Other commissions and fees increased 9 percent due to greater card-related volumes. Net card fees rose 7 percent, primarily as a result of 8 percent growth in cards-in-force. Travel commissions and fees also increased 7 percent, reflecting 8 percent growth in travel sales. Total expenses increased 12 percent. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses increased 18 percent. Human resources expenses increased 13 percent, largely due to severance costs, higher management incentives, including an additional year of incremental stock-based compensation expenses, merit increases and increased employee benefits costs. Credit quality remained strong in both the charge card and lending portfolios. The total provision for losses increased 7 percent driven by a 23 percent volume-driven increase in the charge card provision and an increase in other provision related to insurance and travel reserves. The increase was partially offset by a 6 percent decrease in the lending provision. Reserve coverage ratios remained strong, reflecting excellent credit performance and the company's view of the economic environment. Charge card interest expense increased 20 percent as a result of higher average receivable balances and increased funding costs. Professional services expense increased 10 percent, primarily due to increased technology costs that were driven by higher business and service-related volumes. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased 9 percent, primarily due to higher rent expense and amortization of software costs.
6 AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS (AEFA) reported second quarter net income of $140 million, down 19 percent from $174 million a year ago. Results for the current quarter included $54 million ($35 million after-tax) of the previously mentioned costs related to the spin-off of AEFA. Total revenues increased 10 percent. Net investment income increased 6 percent from year-ago levels, reflecting higher levels of invested assets and net investment gains of $57 million pre-tax principally resulting from the sale of AEFA's interest in a structured investment. AEFA had net investment gains of $30 million pre-tax in the second quarter of 2004. Investment management and service fees increased 10 percent, reflecting higher levels of assets under management due to higher average equity values and net asset inflows. Distribution fees increased 15 percent, benefiting from higher fees earned on wrap accounts. Property-casualty insurance premiums rose 18 percent from last year, reflecting a 16 percent increase in the average number of policies in-force generated, most notably, from the Costco relationship. Other revenues increased 18 percent, benefiting from higher fees earned on financial planning and advice services. Total expenses increased 17 percent as a result of higher human resources costs, provisions for losses and benefits, and other operating expenses. Total human resources expenses rose 24 percent from year-ago levels, primarily due to AEFA spin-off related costs, higher field force compensation driven by greater product sales and higher performance-related incentives at Threadneedle. Provisions for losses and benefits increased 12 percent, largely due to higher interest crediting rates and volume growth on certificate products. Other operating expenses increased 24 percent, primarily reflecting spin-off related costs. The increase also reflects $35 million in costs related to various securities industry legal and regulatory matters, which compares with $32 million in such costs in the second quarter of 2004.
7 AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK (AEB) reported second quarter net income of $61 million, up 121 percent over the year-ago period, primarily reflecting approximately $33 million of the tax benefit mentioned previously. Pre-tax income was up 7 percent over the year-ago period. The results reflected higher commissions and fees in Private Banking and the Financial Institutions Group, a gain on the sale of AEB's Egypt branch and corporate loan recoveries. These items more than offset the negative impact of higher interest rates and increased human resources and reengineering costs. CORPORATE AND OTHER reported second quarter net income of $4 million, compared with net expenses of $58 million a year ago. The results reflect $49 million of the previously mentioned tax benefit resulting from a Federal tax audit and a $21 million benefit from the previously mentioned settlement of an insurance claim, partially offset by $5 million of AEFA spin-off related costs. ***
8 MANAGED BASIS - TRS Managed basis means the presentation assumes there have been no securitization transactions, i.e. all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the company's balance sheet and income statements, respectively. The company presents TRS information on a managed basis because that is the way the company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Asset securitization is just one of several ways for the company to fund cardmember loans. Use of a managed basis presentation, including non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans, presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business, avoiding distortions due to the mix of funding sources at any particular point in time. For example, irrespective of the funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics, such as changes in delinquencies and write-off rates, for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue and changes in market share, which are all significant metrics in evaluating the company's performance and which can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The Consolidated Section of this press release and attachments provide the GAAP presentation for items described on a managed basis. ***

(Preliminary) Travel Related Services Selected Financial Information Quarters Ended June 30, (Millions) # - Denotes a variance of more than 100%. Securitization income, net represents the non-credit provision components of the net gains and charges from securitization activities, the amortization and related impairment charges, if any, of the related interest-only strip, excess spread related to securitized loans, net finance charge revenue on retained interests in securitized loans and servicing income, net of related discounts or fees. Management views any net gains from securitizations as discretionary benefits to be used for card acquisition expenses, which are reflected in both marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses and other operating expenses. Consequently, the managed Selected Financial Information above for the quarters ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 assumes that gains from new issuances and charges from the amortization and maturities of outstanding lending securitization transactions of $1 million and $9 million, respectively, are offset by higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses of $1 million and $6 million, respectively, and other operating expenses of nil and $3 million, respectively. Accordingly, the incremental expenses, as well as the impact of this net activity, have been eliminated. -9-

(C) Loans other than certain smaller-balance consumer loans (including loans impaired under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan"), are placed on non-performing status when payments of principal or interest are 90 days past due or if, in management's opinion, the borrower is unlikely to meet its contractual obligations.

EXHIBIT 99.3 [Logo of AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY] 2005 Second Quarter Earnings Supplement The enclosed summary should be read in conjunction with the text and statistical tables included in American Express Company's (the "Company" or "AXP") Second Quarter 2005 Earnings Release. THIS PRESENTATION CONTAINS CERTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES AND SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE ON WHICH THEY ARE MADE. IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL AND OTHER GOALS, ARE SET FORTH ON PAGES 71-73 IN THE COMPANY'S 2004 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS AND IN ITS 2004 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, AND OTHER REPORTS, ON FILE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2005 HIGHLIGHTS o Second quarter diluted EPS of $0.81 increased 19% versus $0.68 last year. Total revenues rose 11%. For the trailing 12 months, ROE was 23%. - 2Q '05 included: -- A $90MM tax benefit resulting from an IRS audit of previous years' tax returns. - $49MM of this benefit was recognized within the Corporate and Other segment, $33MM in AEB, $5MM in TRS and $3MM in AEFA; -- A $115MM ($75MM after-tax) benefit from the recovery of 9/11-related insurance claims. - $90MM of this benefit was recognized in TRS, $21MM in the Corporate and Other segment, and $2MM each in AEFA and AEB; -- $57MM ($37MM after-tax) of net investment gains at AEFA resulting principally from the sale of all of AEFA's interest in a CDO securitization trust; -- $102MM ($66MM after-tax) of reengineering costs, principally related to restructuring costs within the International Payments business, the Corporate Travel business and the Finance and Technologies functions. - $100MM of this cost was recognized within TRS and $2MM in AEB; -- $59MM ($38MM after-tax) of expenses related to AEFA spin-off activities (see discussion on page 2); and -- $35MM ($23MM after-tax) of expenses related to securities industry legal and regulatory matters at AEFA. - 2Q '04 included: -- Net pre-tax investment gains of $30MM at AEFA; and -- $32MM of expenses related to securities industry regulatory and legal matters at AEFA. o Compared with the second quarter of 2004: - Worldwide billed business increased 18% on continued strong consumer, small business and Corporate Services spending growth and over 35% growth in global network partner volumes. A comparatively weaker U.S. dollar benefited the reported worldwide growth rate by 1%. -- Worldwide average spending per proprietary basic card in force increased 13% versus last year (up 12% adjusted for foreign exchange translation); - TRS' worldwide lending balances of $28.1B on an owned basis increased 6%; on a managed basis, worldwide lending balances of $48.8B were up 8%. Excluding the 4Q '04 sale of TRS' equipment leasing product line, managed loans increased 12% (see discussion of "managed basis" on page 7); - Card credit quality continued to be well-controlled and reserve coverage ratios remained strong; - Worldwide cards in force of 67.3MM increased 8%, up 4.8MM from last year and 1.2MM during 2Q '05, on continued proprietary and network card growth; and - AEFA assets owned, managed and administered of $415.5B were up 9% versus last year reflecting market appreciation, favorable foreign currency translation and net asset inflows. o Additional items of note included: - Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services costs increased 18% versus 2Q '04 reflecting higher marketing and promotion expenses and greater rewards costs. Marketing expenses rose due to costs related to the Company's ongoing global "My Life, My Card(SM)" advertising campaign and various business building initiatives. Rewards costs increased, reflecting volume growth, a higher redemption rate, and strong cardmember loyalty program participation. The strong metric performance during the quarter reflected the ongoing benefits of the increased spending over the last two years. - The Company's reengineering initiatives are on track to deliver $1B of additional benefits this year, including significant carry-over benefits from certain initiatives begun in prior periods. Revenue-related reengineering activities are driving a significant portion of the total benefits, representing more than 25% of the benefits delivered in 2Q '05. - As previously disclosed, the Company decided to expense stock options beginning in 1Q '03 and use restricted stock awards in place of stock options for middle management. As a result, the 2Q '05 impacts of incremental annual option grant expense, increased levels of restricted stock awards and other related compensation changes contributed to the 15% increase in human resources expense. -- Compared with last year, the total employee count of 76,800 decreased by 2,000 employees or 3%; compared with last quarter, the employee count was flat. -1-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2005 HIGHLIGHTS (Cont'd) o On February 1, 2005, the Company announced its intention to pursue a spin-off of its AEFA operating unit to shareholders. In the transaction, American Express shareholders would receive 100 percent of the common shares of American Express Financial Corporation, the wholly owned subsidiary that directly and through its subsidiaries and affiliates conducts our AEFA business. The transaction is intended to be tax-free to shareholders and is expected to be completed late in the third quarter of 2005, subject to certain conditions. On May 25th, AEFA announced their new dual branding strategy. Specifically, Ameriprise Financial ("Ameriprise") will be the holding company brand, as well as the name of Ameriprise's branded advisors, who will operate as the Personal Advisors of Ameriprise Financial. The Ameriprise brand will also be associated with products marketed directly to clients, including personal auto and home protection products, 401(k), deposit and credit products and services, wrap accounts, face-amount certificates and retail brokerage services. RiverSourceSM will be the brand associated with mutual funds, annuities and life insurance products for individuals, as well as the asset management business and hedge fund products for institutions. It is expected that AEFA will begin to operate under the Ameriprise name, and also begin to employ the RiverSourceSM brand name as of August 1, 2005. The transition to the new, dual brand architecture will be substantially complete by year-end 2005, but the formal legal entity name changes will not be completed until year-end 2006. American Express made a commitment to appropriately capitalize Ameriprise in order to provide them with sufficient liquidity and access to capital markets, while supporting their existing insurance financial strength ratings. As a result, American Express plans to provide a $1B capital infusion to Ameriprise Financial, prior to the spin-off. The Company believes that the total capital contribution will fully fund the expected one-time transition expenses and provide adequate capital for Ameriprise as of the spin-off date. A portion of the capital contribution from American Express will pre-fund an estimated $875 million in pre-tax separation costs to be borne by Ameriprise. In addition, the American Express Parent expects to incur approximately $70MM of pre-tax separation costs, $50MM of which will be incurred in 2005. To date, the Company on a consolidated basis has incurred total spin-off related costs of $59MM ($38MM after-tax) in 2Q '05 and $22MM ($14MM after-tax) in 1Q '05. Additional information related to the transaction and the business segments of Ameriprise is available in the Ameriprise Financial Inc. Form 10 registration statement on file with the SEC. The financial presentation of the Company's AEFA segment in this Supplement differs in certain significant respects from the financial presentation of Ameriprise in the Form 10. The financial statements in the Form 10 were prepared as if Ameriprise were a stand-alone company, and reflect differences in the businesses comprising the Company's AEFA segment and Ameriprise. o During the quarter, American Express continued to invest in growth opportunities through expanded products and services as we: - Introduced new proprietary card products, including: - A JetBlue Airways co-branded credit card, which allows Cardmembers to earn Award Dollars convertible to points in JetBlue's Flight Gratitude program, TrueBlue(R); - The SkyPoints(TM) card, co-branded with Delta Air Lines, which provides travelers with additional flexibility and savings on Delta airfares; - A consumer and small-business credit card in the U.K., cobranded with Loyalty Management UK, the owners and operators of Nectar, the largest loyalty program in that country; and - The Platinum Business Premium Cash Rebate Card, a fee-free credit card for high-spending small business owners; - Expanded the U.S. GNS business through a new agreement with USAA Federal Savings Bank to issue American Express and USAA branded charge and credit cards in the U.S., which will be accepted globally on the American Express merchant network; - Expanded the non-U.S. GNS business through: - A new partnership with Lloyds TSB to issue credit cards in the United Kingdom on the American Express Network.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED o NET INCOME: Increased 16% to a record quarterly level of $1,013MM. - 2Q '05 included: -- A $90MM tax benefit resulting from an IRS audit of previous years' tax returns. - $49MM of this benefit was recognized within the Corporate and Other segment, $33MM in AEB, $5MM in TRS and $3MM in AEFA; -- A $115MM ($75MM after-tax) benefit from the recovery of 9/11-related insurance claims. - $90MM of this benefit was recognized in TRS, $21MM in the Corporate and Other segment, and $2MM each in AEFA and AEB; -- $57MM ($37MM after-tax) of net investment gains at AEFA resulting principally from the sale of all of AEFA's interest in a CDO securitization trust; -- $102MM ($66MM after-tax) of reengineering costs, principally related to restructuring costs within the International Payments business, the Corporate Travel business and the Finance and Technologies functions. - $100MM of this cost was recognized within TRS and $2MM in AEB; -- $59MM ($38MM after-tax) of expenses related to AEFA spin-off activities (see discussion on page 2); and -- $35MM ($23MM after-tax) of expenses related to securities industry legal and regulatory matters at AEFA. - 2Q '04 included: -- Net pre-tax investment gains of $30MM at AEFA; and -- $32MM of expenses related to securities industry regulatory and legal matters at AEFA. -4-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED (Cont'd) o CONSOLIDATED REVENUES: Revenues increased 11% due to higher discount revenues, higher management and distribution fees, increased Cardmember lending net finance charge revenue, increased other commissions and fees, higher net investment income, higher travel commissions and fees, larger net card fees, greater insurance and annuity revenues, increased net securitization income, and greater other revenues. Consolidated revenue growth versus last year reflected 11% growth at TRS, 10% growth at AEFA, and a 2% increase at AEB. Translation of foreign currency revenues contributed approximately 1% of the 11% revenue growth rate. o CONSOLIDATED EXPENSES: Expenses were up 12%, reflecting greater human resources costs, higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses, greater provision for losses and benefits, higher other operating expenses, and increased interest expense. Consolidated expenses reflected increases versus last year of 12% at TRS, 17% at AEFA, and 1% at AEB. Translation of foreign currency expenses contributed approximately 2% of the 12% expense growth rate. o PRE-TAX MARGIN: Was 16.5% in 2Q '05 compared with 18.2% in 1Q '05 and 17.5% in 2Q '04. o EFFECTIVE TAX RATE: Was 23% in 2Q '05, as compared to 31% in 1Q '05 and in 2Q '04. The lower rate in 2Q '05 reflects the $90MM tax benefit previously discussed. o SHARE REPURCHASES: During 2Q '05, 10MM shares were repurchased versus 12MM shares in 1Q '05 and 19MM shares in 2Q '04. Repurchases during 1Q '05 and 2Q '05 reflect a more measured strategy towards repurchase activity in light of the capital implications of the anticipated spin-off of AEFA. Since the inception of repurchase programs in September 1994, 518MM shares have been acquired under cumulative Board authorizations to repurchase up to 570MM shares, including purchases made under agreements with third parties. CORPORATE AND OTHER o Net income was $4MM in 2Q '05, compared with a net expense of $51MM in 1Q '05 and $58MM in 2Q '04. 2Q '05 includes the $49MM tax audit benefit previously discussed, the $21MM ($14MM after-tax) benefit due to the recovery of 9/11-related insurance claims, and $5MM ($3MM after-tax) of spin-off related expenses. 2Q '04 included an $18MM tax benefit resulting from an IRS audit of previous years' tax returns (1989-1992 fiscal periods), offset by higher interest expense versus the prior year related to corporate debt issuances over the prior 12 months, and higher corporate investment spending on compliance and technology projects. -5-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES # Denotes variance of more than 100%. o NET INCOME: Increased 10%. 2Q '05 included: - A $90MM ($58MM after-tax) benefit from the recovery of 9/11-related insurance claims; - $100MM ($65MM after-tax) of the previously discussed reengineering-related costs; and - A $5MM tax benefit resulting from the IRS audit of previous years' tax returns. o PRE-TAX MARGIN: Was 19.6% in 2Q '05, versus 21.0% in 1Q '05 and 20.1% in 2Q '04. o EFFECTIVE TAX RATE: Was 31% in 2Q '05, compared with 32% in 1Q '05 and 2Q '04. o GAAP BASIS INCOME STATEMENT ITEMS: - SECURITIZATION INCOME, NET: Increased 5% on a greater average balance of securitized loans, a higher portfolio yield and a decrease in portfolio write-offs, partially offset by greater interest expense due to a higher coupon rate paid to certificate holders and an increase in the payment speed of the trust assets. Securitization income, net represents the non-credit provision components of the net gains and charges from securitization activities, the amortization and related impairment charges, if any, of the related interest-only strip, excess spread related to securitized loans, net finance charge revenue on retained interests in securitized loans, and servicing income, net of related discounts or fees. -- During 2Q '05 and 2Q '04, TRS' results reflected net securitization gains, including the credit components, of $1MM ($1MM after-tax) and $9MM ($6MM after-tax), respectively. The average balance of Cardmember lending securitizations was $20.0B in 2Q '05, compared with $18.9B in 2Q '04. - NET FINANCE CHARGE REVENUE: Increased 14%, reflecting 6% growth in the average balance of the owned lending portfolio and a higher portfolio yield. - LENDING PROVISION: Decreased 12% as the higher average balance was offset by improved credit metrics due in part to the alignment of initial reserves with demonstrated credit performance for certain new products. - The above GAAP basis items relating to net finance charge revenue and lending provision reflect the owned portfolio only. "Owned basis" credit quality statistics are available in the Second Quarter 2005 Earnings Release on the TRS Selected Statistical Information pages. -6-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES (Cont'd) SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - MANAGED BASIS: The following supplemental table includes information on both a GAAP basis and a managed basis. The managed basis presentation assumes there have been no securitization transactions, i.e., as if all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected in the Company's balance sheet and income statement, respectively. The Company presents TRS information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that the trends in the Company's cardmember lending business are more accurately portrayed by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Asset securitization is just one of several ways the Company funds cardmember loans. Use of a managed basis presentation, including non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans, presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business, avoiding distortions due to the mix of funding sources at any particular point in time. For example, irrespective of the mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics, such as changes in delinquencies and write-off rates, for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because it is more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue and changes in market share, which are significant metrics in evaluating the Company's performance and which can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. Management views any net gains from securitizations as discretionary benefits to be used for card acquisition expenses, which are reflected in both marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services and other operating expenses. Consequently, the managed basis presentation assumes the impact of this net activity was offset by higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses of $1MM in 2Q '05 and $6MM in 2Q '04, and other operating expenses of $3MM in 2Q '04. Accordingly, the incremental expenses, as well as the impact of the net lending securitization activity, are eliminated. The following table compares and reconciles the GAAP basis TRS income statements to the managed basis information, where different. -7-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES (Cont'd) The following discussion addresses results on a managed basis. o Managed basis net revenue rose 11% from higher discount revenue, higher net finance charge revenue, greater commissions and fees, and higher card fees. o The 12% higher managed basis expenses reflect higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services costs, greater human resources expenses, higher interest expense, increased provision for losses, larger occupancy and equipment costs, and increased professional services expenses. o DISCOUNT REVENUE: An 18% increase in billed business, partially offset by a lower average discount rate, yielded a 16% increase in discount revenue. - The average discount rate was 2.54% in 2Q '05 versus 2.56% in 1Q '05 and 2Q '04. The decrease versus last year and last quarter reflects, in part, changes in the mix of spending between various merchant segments. -- We believe the AXP value proposition is strong. However, as indicated in prior quarters, continued changes in the mix of business, volume-related pricing discounts and selective repricing initiatives will probably continue to result in some erosion of the average discount rate over time. - - BILLED BUSINESS: The 18% increase in worldwide billed business reflected a 13% increase in spending per proprietary basic card and 8% growth in cards in force. -- U.S. billed business was up 17% reflecting growth of 16% within our consumer card business, a 19% increase in small business spending and an 11% improvement in Corporate Services volumes. - Spending per proprietary basic card in force increased 10%. -- U.S. non-T&E-related volume categories (which represented approximately 67% of 2Q '05 U.S. billed business) grew 19%, while T&E volumes rose 11%. -- U.S. airline-related volume, which represented approximately 11% of total U.S. volumes during the quarter, rose 8% as 15% transaction volume growth was suppressed by a 6% lower average airline charge. -- Excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation: - Worldwide billed business and spending per proprietary basic card in force increased 17% and 12%, respectively. - Total billed business outside the U.S. reflected double-digit proprietary growth in all regions, with the largest increases in Canada and Latin America. - Within our proprietary business, billed business outside the U.S. reflected 13% growth in consumer and small business spending, as well as a 17% increase in Corporate Services volumes. - Spending per proprietary basic card in force outside the U.S. rose 15%. -- Global Network Services volumes rose by more than 35%. -- Worldwide airline volumes, which represented approximately 13% of total volumes during the quarter, increased 16% on 17% growth in transaction volume, partially offset by a decrease in the average airline charge of 1%. -8-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES (Cont'd) o BILLED BUSINESS (cont'd): - CARDS IN FORCE: Rose 8% worldwide versus last year on continued strong card acquisitions and improved average customer retention levels within our proprietary issuing business, as well as strong growth in network cards. -- U.S. cards in force rose 700K during the quarter. -- Outside the United States, 500K cards in force were added during the quarter. o NET FINANCE CHARGE REVENUE: Increased 10% on 6% growth in average worldwide lending balances and a higher portfolio yield. - The yield on the worldwide portfolio was 8.7% in 2Q '05 versus 8.8% in 1Q '05 and 8.6% in 2Q '04. The increase versus last year reflects a lower proportion of the U.S. portfolio on introductory rates and increased finance charge rates, partially offset by rising funding costs. o NET CARD FEES: Rose 7% due to higher cards in force. In both 2Q '05 and 1Q '05, the average annual fee per proprietary card in force was $35 versus $34 in 2Q '04. o TRAVEL COMMISSIONS AND FEES: Increased 7% as higher travel sales were partially offset by lower transaction fees as a greater proportion of bookings were made on-line. o OTHER COMMISSIONS AND FEES: Increased 9% on greater volume-related foreign exchange conversion fees, higher card-related fees and assessments, and larger network partner-related fees. o TC INVESTMENT INCOME: Decreased slightly on higher average investments and a lower investment yield. TC sales increased 3% versus last year. o OTHER REVENUES: Declined 5% as higher Tax and Business Services, Publishing and merchant-related revenues were offset by lower ATM revenues resulting from the 3Q '04 sale of the remaining portion of the ATM business. o MARKETING, PROMOTION, REWARDS AND CARDMEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES: Increased 18%, reflecting higher marketing and promotion expenses and greater rewards costs. The increase in marketing and promotion expenses is due to the Company's ongoing global brand advertising campaign and our continued focus on business-building initiatives. The growth in rewards costs is attributable to volume growth, a higher redemption rate and strong cardmember loyalty program participation. o OTHER PROVISION: More than doubled reflecting higher insurance and travel-related reserves. o CHARGE CARD INTEREST EXPENSE: Rose 20% due to a greater average cardmember receivable balance and a higher effective cost of funds. o HUMAN RESOURCES EXPENSE: Increased 13% due to severance costs, higher management incentives, including an additional year of incremental stock-based compensation expenses, merit increases and increased employee benefit costs. - The employee count at 6/05 of 64,300 was down 200 versus 3/05 and down 2,000 versus 6/04. o PROFESSIONAL SERVICES EXPENSES: Rose 10% primarily due to increased technology costs related to higher business and service-related volumes. o OCCUPANCY AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSES: Rose 9% primarily due to higher rent expense and the amortization of software costs. o OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES: Decreased 1% primarily reflecting the $90MM insurance recovery discussed previously and lower expenses as a result of our 3Q '04 sale of the ATM business, partially offset by increased costs related to restructuring and reengineering activities and higher business volumes. -9-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES (Cont'd) o CREDIT QUALITY: - Overall credit quality continued to perform exceptionally well. While the recent changes in bankruptcy law legislation did drive increased filings and related write-offs during the quarter, the impact waned by quarter end. - The provision for losses on charge card products increased 23% reflecting higher volumes. - The lending provision for losses was down 6% versus last year, despite growth in loans outstanding, due to well-controlled credit, and in part due to the alignment of initial reserves with demonstrated credit performance for certain new products. - Reserve coverage ratios, which are well in excess of 100% of past due balances, remained strong. - WORLDWIDE CHARGE CARD: * - WORLDWIDE LENDING: ** * There are no off-balance sheet Charge Card securitizations. Therefore, "Owned basis" and "Managed basis" credit quality statistics for the Charge Card portfolio are the same. ** As previously described, this information is presented on a "Managed basis". "Owned basis" credit quality statistics are available in the Second Quarter 2005 Earnings Release on the TRS Selected Statistical Information pages. Credit trends are generally consistent under both reporting methods. -10-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS * Includes variable universal life and universal life insurance charges. o NET INCOME: Decreased 19%. - 2Q '05 included: -- $54MM ($35MM after-tax) of expenses related to spin-off related activities (see discussion on page 2); -- $57MM ($37MM after-tax) of net investment gains resulting principally from the sale of all of AEFA's interest in a CDO securitization trust; -- $35MM ($23MM after-tax) of expenses related to securities industry legal and regulatory matters; and -- A $4MM benefit related to the tax audit and 9/11 insurance recovery. - 2Q '04 included: -- Net pre-tax investment gains of $30MM; -- A $16MM tax expense primarily as a result of required amendments to prior-year tax returns; and -- $32MM of expenses related to securities industry regulatory and legal matters. o REVENUES: Increased 10% due to: - Increased distribution fees; - Greater investment management and service fees; - Increased net investment income; - Higher insurance-related revenues; and - Greater other revenues, driven by growth in financial planning and advice services fees, and higher fees earned on non-proprietary funds. o PRE-TAX MARGIN: Was 9.3% in 2Q '05 compared with 12.6% in 1Q '05 and 15.2% in 2Q '04. Compressed margins in 2005 reflect the impact of spin-off related costs. o EFFECTIVE TAX RATE: Was 21% in 2Q '05 versus 29% in 1Q '05 and 34% in 2Q '04. The lower rate in 2Q '05 reflects the tax audit benefit noted above and lower levels of pre-tax income compared to tax advantaged items. 2Q '04 included the $16MM of additional tax expense noted above. -11-

Branded advisor-generated sales increased 22% on a cash basis and 12% on the internally used "gross dealer concession" (GDC) basis, a commonly used financial services industry measure of the sales production of the advisor channel. - Total mutual fund cash sales increased 16% versus last year, driven by higher sales of non-proprietary products which more than offset lower proprietary product sales. A significant portion of non-proprietary sales continued to occur in "wrap" accounts (which are included in assets managed). - Total annuity cash sales increased 28%, driven by a 46% increase in proprietary variable annuity product sales through the advisor and third party distribution channels. - Total certificate cash sales increased 31% due to stronger advisor-sales and to higher sales of certificates sold to clients outside the U.S. through the joint venture between AEFA and AEB. - Total cash sales of insurance products rose 9%, primarily reflecting higher property-casualty insurance sales, largely due to sales through direct mail channels, and higher life insurance sales through the advisor channel. - Total institutional cash sales decreased 11%. 2Q '04 included the benefit of a $1.1B private placement offering of a structured investment managed by AEFA. This was partially offset by a similar $0.8B offering during 2Q '05. - Total other cash sales decreased 3% reflecting a decline in 401(k) activity levels, which was partially offset by higher limited partnership product sales. - Advisor product sales (GDC basis) generated through financial planning and advice services were 75% of total sales in 2Q '05 versus 77% in 1Q '05 and 75% in 2Q '04. o NET INVESTMENT INCOME: Increased 6% versus last year reflecting higher levels of invested assets and the impact of the higher net investment gains versus last year. 2Q '05 included $57MM of net investment gains ($87MM of gross gains partially offset by $30MM of gross losses).

The number of financial plans sold rose 5% compared to 2Q '04. o PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES AND BENEFITS: - INTEREST CREDITED ON ANNUITIES AND UNIVERSAL LIFE-TYPE CONTRACTS: Remained flat as lower interest crediting rates on our annuity products were partially offset by higher life insurance in force levels and annuity accumulation values. - BENEFITS ON INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES: Increased 1% due to higher life and disability income insurance in force levels and higher annuity levels. - INTEREST CREDITED ON INVESTMENT CERTIFICATES: Rose 97% on higher interest crediting rates and higher average reserve balances, partially due to a marketing promotion program that ran in 1Q '05. - LOSSES AND EXPENSES ON PROPERTY-CASUALTY INSURANCE: Grew 17% as a result of higher average policies in force. o HUMAN RESOURCES EXPENSE - FIELD: Increased 18% reflecting $23MM of spin-off related expenses, improved advisor productivity and growth in the advisor force. - TOTAL ADVISOR FORCE: Grew to 12,162 at 6/05, up 219 advisors or 2% versus 6/04, but was 194 advisors lower versus 3/05, primarily due to fewer prospective advisors entering the training program in 4Q '04, which resulted in lower employee advisor appointments in 2Q '05. -- Veteran advisor retention rates remain strong; and -- Total advisor productivity improved. - The total number of retail clients increased by 1% versus last year as we continued our focus on high value client acquisition activities. When compared to the second quarter last year, client acquisitions rose 3% and average assets per client were up 8%.
