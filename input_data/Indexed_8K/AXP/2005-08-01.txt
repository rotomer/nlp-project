Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure As announced on August 1, 2005, American Express Company (the "Company") and H&R Block Inc. have signed a definitive agreement for H&R Block Inc. to acquire American Express Tax and Business Services Inc. from the Company for a purchase price of approximately $220 million. The transaction is scheduled to be completed by September 30, 2005 but is subject to pre-acquisition clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. The Company does not expect the gain on the sale to have a material impact on third-quarter results because of unrelated costs associated with its global re-engineering initiatives. The sale is also not expected to have a material impact on the Company's ongoing earnings.
