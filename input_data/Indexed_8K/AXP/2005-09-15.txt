Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure. American Express Company ("American Express" or the "Company") is reporting in this filing the following information regarding the commencement by Delta Air Lines, Inc. ("Delta") on September 14, 2005 of a voluntary case under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code: As part of Delta's decision to file for protection under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, American Express has reached an agreement-in-principle with Delta to restructure certain of the Company's financial arrangements with the airline, including those arrangements entered into with Delta in the fourth quarter of 2004 in connection with the extension into the next decade of the American Express Co-brand, Membership Rewards (MR) and Card acceptance agreements with Delta. In particular, Delta has agreed to repay the aggregate $500 million that American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. ("TRS") advanced to Delta in the fourth quarter of 2004 and first quarter of 2005 as prepayment for the purchase of Delta SkyMiles reward points to be used for the Co-brand and MR programs. Contemporaneously with the repayment, TRS would lend to Delta $350 million as part of Delta's post-petition debtor-in-possession ("DIP") financing under the Bankruptcy Code (the "AXP Post-petition Facility"). The AXP Post-petition Facility would continue to be structured as an advance against TRS's obligations to purchase Delta SkyMiles rewards points under the companies' co-brand and MR agreements and would be amortized ratably each month over a 17-month period beginning in July 2006. The AXP Post-petition Facility would be secured by (i) senior liens in Delta assets specifically related to its American Express Co-brand, MR and Card acceptance relationships and (ii) liens subordinate to senior liens in all other Delta assets and certain Delta subsidiaries, which are expected to secure the $1.7 billion post-petition DIP financing being arranged by General Electric Capital Corporation ("GE Capital") and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. (the "GECC Post-petition Facility"). The AXP Post-petition Facility is subject to certain conditions, including approval by the Bankruptcy Court and execution of definitive documentation. In addition, Delta's bankruptcy filings indicate that it would utilize the proceeds from the GECC Post-petition Facility to, among other things, repay all outstanding principal and interest under the pre-petition facility arranged by GE Capital in the fourth quarter of 2004, which would include repayment of amounts loaned by American Express as a participant in such facility. At present, American Express has outstanding loans of approximately $57 million to Delta under such facility. In connection with its bankruptcy filing, Delta has filed a motion asking the Bankruptcy Court to authorize Delta to assume, or continue, its American Express Co-brand, MR and Card acceptance agreements with American Express, as well as certain other agreements with the Company, all of which would continue in effect for the remainder of their previously negotiated terms. As previously disclosed, American Express' Delta SkyMiles Credit Card co-brand portfolio accounts for less than 10% of the Company's worldwide billed business and less than 15% of worldwide managed lending receivables.
