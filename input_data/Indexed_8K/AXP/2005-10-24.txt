New York - October 24, 2005 - AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY today reported third quarter income from continuing operations of $865 million, up 23 percent from $702 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations rose to $0.69, up 25 percent from $0.55 a year ago. During the quarter the Company completed the spin-off of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (formerly known as American Express Financial Corporation) and the sale of its Tax and Business Services unit (TBS). Net income for the quarter, which includes those businesses as discontinued operations, totaled $1.0 billion, up 17 percent from $879 million a year ago. Earnings per share on a diluted basis rose to $0.82, up 19 percent from $0.69. The company's reported return on equity (ROE) was 24.2 percent, up from 21.5 percent a year ago. This ratio is determined on a trailing 12-month basis using net income and total average shareholders' equity (including discontinued operations prior to disposal). Pro forma ROE, which is determined using trailing four quarters income from continuing operations (which excludes discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting changes) over reported shareholders' equity at September 30, 2005 was 31.7 percent. (FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT PRO FORMA ROE, SEE THE "PRO FORMA ROE" SECTION BELOW.) Consolidated revenues rose 11 percent to $6.1 billion, up from $5.5 billion a year ago. Consolidated expenses totaled $5.0 billion, up 12 percent from $4.5 billion a year ago. "This quarter's performance underscores the strength and momentum of an American Express that is now focused on the global payments business," said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive. "We exceeded our long-term targets for earnings and revenue growth and, on a pro forma basis, the return on equity targets set for the new American Express. "Total spending on American Express cards grew 18 percent, reflecting a double digit rise in average cardmember spending and the addition of 5.7 million cards during the last year. We continued to outpace our major -2-
competitors with strong spending increases among our consumer, small business and corporate cardmembers globally. The quarter also reflected a deepening of our relationships with bank partners issuing American Express cards in the U.S. and around the world. In addition, overall credit quality and our reserve levels remained strong." The quarter's income from continuing operations included three significant items. A tax benefit of $105 million related to the resolution of a prior year tax item enabled the Company to accelerate various reengineering initiatives, primarily in business travel, finance and technology functions, and international operations. These initiatives resulted in $86 million ($56 million after-tax) in reengineering costs. The quarter also included a provision for losses and benefits of $49 million to cover costs associated with Hurricane Katrina. Third quarter revenues and expenses - ----------------------------------- The increase in quarterly revenues reflected sharply higher discount revenue, up 16 percent as a result of an 18 percent increase in cardmember spending. Average cardmember spending rose 12 percent and total cards-in-force were up 9 percent. The benefits of overall higher cardmember spending were partially offset by a slightly lower average discount rate that continued to reflect, in part, the change in the mix of business towards the retail and everyday spending categories. Net finance charge revenue increased 16 percent, driven by growth in average cardmember loan balances and a higher yield. Similarly, securitization income rose 20 percent, primarily reflecting a higher level of securitized loans. Third quarter expenses reflected higher costs related to human resources, as well as for marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services. Human resources expenses rose 9 percent, driven by severance costs associated with restructuring activities and higher management incentives which included the impact of an additional year of incremental stock-based compensation expenses, merit increases and increased employee benefits costs. -3-
Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses rose 16 percent, primarily reflecting increased brand-related advertising, strong acquisition activities and higher rewards-related costs. The provision for losses and benefits rose 33 percent, principally reflecting strong charge and lending growth, a higher provision rate, and the previously mentioned $49 million of costs associated with Hurricane Katrina. The year-ago provision included a charge of $115 million related to a securitization reconciliation, partially offset by the reduction of $60 million in certain merchant-related reserves. Discontinued operations ----------------------- Income from discontinued operations primarily includes results from Ameriprise and TBS, which are no longer part of American Express. Included in this item are also $71 million after-tax of total spin-off related costs - at both Ameriprise and American Express - and a net gain of $63 million after-tax from certain dispositions, including the sale of TBS. Segment results --------------- Starting this quarter, American Express will provide financial reports and selected statistical data for new segments. They are: U.S. Card Services, International Card & Global Commercial Services, Global Network & Merchant Services, and Corporate & Other. The Company manages its overall business to achieve - on average and over time - financial targets that include earnings per share growth of 12-15 percent, revenue growth of at least 8 percent and a return on shareholders' equity of 28-30 percent. Segment level results may vary significantly from period to period based on specific decisions to allocate investment dollars and marketing resources to capitalize on competitive opportunities. -4-
THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF THIRD QUARTER RESULTS PRESENTS U.S. CARD SERVICES SEGMENT RESULTS ON A "MANAGED BASIS," AS IF THERE HAD BEEN NO CARDMEMBER LENDING SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS AND TO REFLECT CERTAIN TAX-EXEMPT INVESTMENT INCOME AS IF IT HAD BEEN EARNED ON A TAXABLE BASIS. IN ADDITION, INTERNATIONAL CARD & Global Commercial Services reflects a reclassification of certain foreign exchange services, as revenues on a managed basis. For these business segments, this is the basis used by management to evaluate operations. For further information about managed basis and reconciliation of GAAP and managed information, see the "Managed Basis" section below. The Global Network & Merchant Services, and Corporate & Other segment results below are presented on a GAAP basis. U.S. CARD SERVICES reported third quarter net income of $446 million, up 25 percent from $356 million a year ago. Total revenues for the third quarter increased 14 percent over the year-ago period to $3.3 billion, reflecting continued strong growth in spending and borrowing on U.S. consumer and small business cards. Total expenses increased 12 percent. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses increased 18 percent, reflecting both higher marketing and promotion expenses and greater rewards costs. Year-ago expenses included the securitization-related charges mentioned earlier. INTERNATIONAL CARD & GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES reported third quarter net income of $254 million, up 14 percent from $224 million a year ago. Total revenues for the third quarter increased 8 percent over the year-ago period to $2.3 billion, reflecting continued strong growth in spending on corporate cards and international consumer cards. Total expenses increased 9 percent. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses increased 9 percent, reflecting both higher marketing and promotion expenses, and greater rewards costs. The provision for losses and benefits rose 55 percent due to strong charge and lending volume growth, and higher provision rates. -5-
GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES reported third quarter net income of $141 million, down 19 percent from $173 million a year ago. Total revenues for the third quarter increased 9 percent over the year-ago period to $716 million, reflecting continued strong growth in merchant charge volume. The year-ago period included revenues from the Company's ATM business, which was sold in 2004. Spending on cards issued by the Company's network partners increased more than 35% from a year ago. Total expenses increased 30 percent. The total provision for losses increased significantly from year ago levels, primarily reflecting last year's reduction of merchant-related reserves that was mentioned earlier. Marketing and promotion increased 55 percent, primarily reflecting higher company-wide brand-related advertising. CORPORATE & OTHER reported third quarter net income of $24 million, compared with net expenses of $51 million a year ago. The results reflect the $105 million tax benefit mentioned earlier. *** -6-
Managed Basis ------------- For U.S. Card Services, managed basis means the presentation assumes there have been no securitization transactions, i.e. all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the Company's balance sheet and income statements, respectively. The Company presents U.S. Card Services information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Asset securitization is just one of several ways for the Company to fund cardmember loans. Use of a managed basis presentation, including non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans, presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business, avoiding distortions due to the mix of funding sources at any particular point in time. The Company does not currently securitize international loans. Irrespective of the funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics, such as changes in delinquencies and write-off rates, for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant in evaluating the Company's performance and can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The managed basis presentation for U.S. Card Services also reflects an increase to interest income recorded to enable management to evaluate tax exempt investments on a basis consistent with taxable investment securities. On a GAAP basis interest income associated with tax exempt investments is recorded based on amounts earned. Accordingly, information presented on a managed basis assumes that tax exempt securities earned income at rates as if the securities produced taxable income with a corresponding increase in the provision for income taxes. The managed basis presentation for International Card & Global Commercial Services reflects a foreign exchange services reclassification for revenue earned related to the sale and purchase of foreign currencies as part of the foreign exchange business. On a GAAP basis, these revenues are included with other foreign exchange items that are reflected in other operating expenses. Accordingly, information presented on a managed basis assumes that the amounts earned are included in other revenue with a corresponding increase in other operating expenses. -7-

Pro Forma ROE - ------------- The Company's consolidated return on equity (ROE) is calculated on a trailing 12-month basis using reported net income over average total shareholder's equity (including discontinued operations). The Company also reports pro forma ROE, which is determined using trailing four quarters income from continuing operations (which excludes discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting changes) over reported shareholders' equity at period end. Management believes pro forma ROE is an important measure because it reflects performance of the Company's continuing businesses by excluding the impact of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. and American Express Tax and Business Services, Inc., which were disposed of as of September 30, 2005. ROE Pro Forma ROE - ------------------------------- ----------------------------------- Trailing 12-months net income: Trailing four quarters income from $3.9 billion continuing operations: $3.1 billion Trailing 12-months average Total shareholders' equity at total shareholders' equity: September 30, 2005: $16.0 billion $9.9 billion ROE: 24.2% Pro forma ROE: 31.7% *** American Express Company (www.americanexpress.com) is a leading global payments, network, travel, and banking company founded in 1850.

(Preliminary) U.S. CARD SERVICES SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION Quarters Ended September 30, (Millions) The tables above reconcile the GAAP basis for certain income statement line items to the managed basis information, where different. Securitization income, net represents the non-credit provision components of the net gains and charges from securitization activities, the amortization and related impairment charges, if any, of the related interest-only strip, excess spread related to securitized loans, net finance charge revenue on retained interests in securitized loans and servicing income, net of related discounts or fees. Management views any net gains from securitizations as discretionary benefits to be used for card acquisition expenses, which are reflected in both marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses and other operating expenses. Consequently, the managed Selected Financial Information above for the quarters ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 assumes that gains from new issuances and charges from the amortization and maturities of outstanding lending securitization transactions of $3 million and $9 million, respectively, are offset by higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses of $2 million and $6 million, respectively, and other operating expenses of $1 million and $3 million, respectively. Accordingly, the incremental expenses, as well as the impact of this net activity, have been eliminated. The tax equivalent effect represents an increase to interest income recorded to enable management to evaluate tax exempt investments on a basis consistent with taxable investment securities. On a GAAP basis, interest income associated with tax exempt investments is recorded based on amounts earned. Accordingly, the managed Selected Financial Information above for the quarters ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 assumes that tax exempt securities earned income at rates as if the securities produced taxable income with a corresponding increase in the provision for income taxes. -13-

Management views any net gains from securitizations as discretionary benefits to be used for card acquisition expenses, which are reflected in both marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses and other operating expenses. Consequently, the managed Selected Financial Information above for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 assumes that gains from new issuances and charges from the amortization and maturities of outstanding lending securitization transactions of $9 million are offset by higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses of $6 million and other operating expenses of $3 million. Accordingly, the incremental expenses, as well as the impact of this net activity, have been eliminated. The tax equivalent effect represents an increase to interest income recorded to enable management to evaluate tax exempt investments on a basis consistent with taxable investment securities. On a GAAP basis, interest income associated with tax exempt investments is recorded based on amounts earned. Accordingly, the managed Selected Financial Information above for the quarters ended December 31, 2004 and September 30, 2004 assumes that tax exempt securities earned income at rates as if the securities produced taxable income with a corresponding increase in the provision for income taxes. -15-

Exhibit 99.3 [AMERICAN EXPRESS(R) LOGO] 2005 Third Quarter Earnings Supplement The enclosed summary should be read in conjunction with the text and statistical tables included in American Express Company's (the "Company" or "AXP") Third Quarter 2005 Earnings Release. This presentation contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of the date on which they are made. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, including the Company's financial and other goals, are set forth on pages 71-73 in the Company's 2004 Annual Report to Shareholders and in its 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and other reports, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2005 HIGHLIGHTS - - Third quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.69 increased 25% versus $0.55 last year. Total revenues rose 11%. For the trailing 12 months, including discontinued operations, ROE was 24%. - 3Q '05 Income from continuing operations included: - A $105MM tax benefit from the resolution of a prior year tax item related to the sale of AMEX Life in 1995; - $86MM ($56MM after-tax) of reengineering costs, principally related to restructuring efforts in our business travel, finance and technology functions, and international operations areas; and - A $49MM ($32MM after-tax) provision to reflect the estimated costs related to Hurricane Katrina. $38MM of this provision is related to our U.S. consumer and small business activities, $9MM is associated with our Corporate Services activities and $2MM is merchant-related. - 3Q '04 Income from continuing operations included: - A charge of $115MM as a result of the reconciliation of prior year's securitization-related lending receivable accounts; and - A $60MM benefit reflecting a reduction in merchant-related reserves. - The company's reported return on equity (ROE) was 24%, up from 22% a year ago. This ratio is determined on a trailing 12-month basis using net income and total average shareholders' equity (including discontinued operations). Pro forma ROE, which is determined using trailing four quarters income from continuing operations (which excludes discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting changes) over reported shareholders' equity at September 30, 2005, was 32%. See "Supplemental Information - Pro Forma ROE" discussion below. - - On September 30, 2005, the Company completed the distribution of all of the outstanding shares of Ameriprise Financial (formerly American Express Financial Advisors) to its shareholders. This non-cash distribution was tax-free to the Company's shareholders. In addition, during the third quarter of 2005, the Company sold its Tax and Business Services ("TBS") business. The operating results and assets and liabilities related to these businesses spun-off or sold have been included in discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. - 3Q '05 income from discontinued operations of $165MM also included a net gain of $63MM after-tax from certain dispositions, including the sale of TBS, $60MM of after-tax Ameriprise spin-off-related expenses and $11MM of after-tax Parent Company spin-off related expenses. - - Including these discontinued operations diluted EPS on a net income basis of $0.82 increased 19%. - - Compared with the third quarter of 2004: - Worldwide billed business increased 18% on continued strong growth within both the proprietary and network businesses. A comparatively weaker U.S. dollar had a marginal benefit on the reported worldwide growth rate. - Worldwide cards in force of 69.0MM increased 9%, up 5.7MM from last year and 1.7MM during 3Q '05, on continued proprietary and network card growth. - Worldwide average spending per proprietary basic card in force increased 12% versus last year; - Worldwide lending balances of $29.9B on an owned basis increased 18%; on a managed basis, worldwide lending balances of $50.6B were up 11%. Excluding the 4Q '04 sale of the company's equipment leasing product line, managed loans increased 15% (see discussion of "managed basis" below); and - Overall card credit quality continued to be well controlled and reserve coverage ratios remained strong. - - Additional items of note included: - Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services costs increased 16% versus 3Q '04 reflecting higher marketing and promotion expenses and greater rewards costs. Marketing expenses rose due to continuing costs related to the Company's ongoing global "My Life, My Card(SM)" advertising campaign and various business building initiatives, including the expansion of our product portfolio. Rewards costs increased, reflecting volume growth, a higher redemption rate, and strong cardmember loyalty program participation. The strong metric performance during the quarter reflected the ongoing benefits of the increased spending over the last two years. - The Company's reengineering initiatives are on track to deliver $1B of additional benefits this year, including significant carry-over benefits from certain initiatives begun in prior periods. Revenue-related reengineering activities are driving a significant portion of the total benefits, representing more than 25% of the benefits delivered in 3Q '05. - As previously disclosed, the Company decided to expense stock options beginning in 1Q '03 and use restricted stock awards in place of stock options for middle management. As a result, the 3Q '05 impacts of incremental annual option grant expense, increased levels of restricted stock awards and other related compensation changes contributed to the 9% increase in human resources expense. In addition, the Company elected to adopt SFAS 123R, effective July 1, 2005. The impact of adoption was immaterial since the Company has been expensing share based awards granted after January 1, 2003 under the provisions of SFAS 123. - Compared with last year, the total employee count within continuing operations of 65,300 decreased by 1,600 employees or 2%; compared with last quarter, the employee count declined by 200 or less than 1%. -1-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2005 HIGHLIGHTS - - Separately, the Company announced that as part of Delta Airlines' ("Delta") decision to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Company agreed with Delta to restructure certain of its financial arrangements with the airline. In particular, Delta agreed to repay to AXP an aggregate $557MM, representing $500MM that AXP advanced in the fourth quarter of 2004 and first quarter of 2005 as prepayment for the purchase of Delta SkyMiles rewards points and $57MM related to a pre-petition facility arranged by GE Capital in the fourth quarter of 2004. Contemporaneously with the repayment, AXP lent to Delta $350MM as part of Delta's post-petition, debtor-in-possession ("DIP") financing under the Bankruptcy Code. Upon approval of the broader DIP financing facility, Delta applied $50MM of proceeds to pay down a portion of the AXP facility, leaving a remaining balance of $300MM. This post-petition facility continues to be structured as an advance against AXP's obligations to purchase Delta SkyMiles rewards points under the Company's co-brand and Membership Rewards ("MR") agreements and will be amortized ratably each month beginning July, 2006. Final payment will be made by September, 2007. The AXP post-petition facility will be secured by (i) senior liens in Delta assets specifically related to its American Express co-brand, MR and card acceptance relationships and (ii) liens subordinate to senior liens in all other Delta assets and certain Delta subsidiaries. - - During the quarter, American Express continued to invest in growth opportunities through expanded products and services. In particular, we: - Launched the IN: Chicago and IN: LA cards which, in addition to our IN:NYC card, provide targeted rewards for young, urban cardmembers and support a city-centric marketing strategy; - Launched the Blue Sky Credit Card for consumers and the Business FreedomPass(SM) Credit Card for small businesses enabling cardmembers to earn points specifically towards travel rewards; - Expanded our corporate card relationship with British Airways with a new co-branded card specifically targeting small and medium sized businesses; - Expanded benefits of our co-branded Corporate Card relationship with American Airlines to enhance its features for mid-sized businesses; - Announced an agent bank alliance between Guaranty Bank and OPEN from American Express(SM) to exclusively offer small business cards with both the Guaranty Bank and American Express brands; - Announced an agreement with Oriental Financial Group to be the first bank to distribute American Express consumer and commercial cards in Puerto Rico; - Partnered with Banco Patagonia to issue American Express cards, denominated in both pesos and U.S. dollars, in Argentina; - Formed a strategic alliance with Standard Chartered Bank to issue credit cards on the American Express network in Asia, with an initial launch in Hong Kong; - Announced a partnership with Shinhan Card to issue American Express cards in South Korea; - Launched a program to allow cardmembers to instantly redeem points to book travel directly on the American Express travel website without blackout dates or restriction; - Added the Private Jet Rewards luxury option, which allows cardmembers to redeem reward points for private jet travel; - Enhanced the premier Trackpoint and Preferred Extras Corporate Travel security and benefit programs, through the expansion of their scope and relevance to eligible cardmembers; and - Marked a decade of online business travel service, with nearly 5 million online transactions over the year ended 7/31/05, and more than one-third of total U.S. business travel reservations conducted through our website. -2-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED (Preliminary) STATEMENTS OF INCOME (GAAP basis) - - Income from continuing operations increased 23% to $865MM. - 3Q '05 Income from continuing operations included: - A $105MM tax benefit from the resolution of a prior year tax item related to the sale of AMEX Life in 1995; - $86MM ($56MM after-tax) of reengineering costs, principally related to restructuring efforts in our business travel, finance and technology functions, and international operations areas; and - A $49MM ($32MM after-tax) provision during the quarter to reflect the estimated costs related to Hurricane Katrina. $38MM of this provision is related to our U.S. consumer and small business activities, $9MM is associated with our Corporate Services activities and $2MM is merchant-related. - 3Q '04 Income from continuing operations included: - A charge of $115MM as a result of the reconciliation of prior year's securitization-related lending receivable accounts; and - A $60MM benefit reflecting a reduction in merchant-related reserves. -3-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED - - Net Income including discontinued operations rose 17% to $1,030MM. - 3Q '05 Income from discontinued operations of $165MM included a net gain of $63MM after-tax from certain dispositions, including the sale of TBS, $60MM after-tax of Ameriprise spin-off-related expenses and $11MM of after-tax Parent Company spin-off related expenses. - - SHARE REPURCHASES: During 3Q '05, 8MM shares were repurchased versus 10MM shares in 2Q '05 and 15MM shares in 3Q '04. Repurchases year to date reflect a more measured approach towards repurchase activity in light of the capital implications of the spin-off of Ameriprise. Since the inception of repurchase programs in September 1994, 526MM shares have been acquired under cumulative Board authorizations to repurchase up to 570MM shares, including purchases made under agreements with third parties. - - CONSOLIDATED REVENUES: Consolidated revenues increased 11% reflecting increases versus last year of 16% within U.S. Card Services, 9% within International Card & Global Commercial Services and 9% within Global Network & Merchant Services. Revenues increased due to higher discount revenues, increased Cardmember lending net finance charge revenue, greater securitization income, higher other commissions and fees, higher net card fees, and increased travel commissions and fees, partially offset by declines in other revenues and other investment and interest income. Translation of foreign currency revenues contributed less than 1% to the 11% revenue growth rate. - - CONSOLIDATED EXPENSES: Consolidated expenses increased 12%, reflecting increases versus last year of 13% within U.S. Card Services, 10% within International Card & Global Commercial Services and 30% within Global Network & Merchant Services. Expense growth reflected higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services costs, greater provision for losses, higher human resources expenses, higher interest costs, larger professional services expenses, and greater occupancy and equipment costs, partially offset by lower other expenses and lower communication costs. Translation of foreign currency expenses contributed less than 1% to the 12% growth rate. - - PRE-TAX MARGIN: Was 17.8% in 3Q '05 compared with 18.4% in 2Q '05 and 18.5% in 3Q '04. - - EFFECTIVE TAX RATE: Was 20% in 3Q '05, as compared to 23% in 2Q '05 and 31% in 3Q '04. The lower tax rates in 3Q '05 and 2Q '05 reflect benefits of $105MM and $90MM, respectively, from the resolution of previous years' tax return items. - - DISCOUNT REVENUE: An 18% increase in billed business, partially offset by a lower average discount rate, yielded a 16% increase in discount revenue. - The average discount rate* was 2.57% in 3Q '05 versus 2.58% in 2Q '05 and 2.60% in 3Q '04. The decrease versus last year and last quarter continues to reflect, in part, changes in the mix of spending between various merchant segments. - We believe the AXP value proposition is strong. However, as indicated in prior quarters, continued changes in the mix of business, volume-related pricing discounts and selective repricing initiatives will likely continue to result in some erosion of the average discount rate over time. * For additional information about billed business and discount rate calculations, please refer to the Third Quarter 2005 Earnings Release, American Express Company Selected Statistical Information pages. **Proprietary card activity only. -4-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED - - DISCOUNT REVENUE (CONT'D): - WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS: The 18% increase in worldwide billed business reflected an 18% increase in U.S. Card Services, a 15% increase in International Card & Global Commercial Services and a 35% increase in Global Network Services ("GNS") partner volume. Worldwide average spend per proprietary basic card grew by 12% and total cards in force grew by 9%. - U.S. billed business was up 19% reflecting growth of 17% within our consumer card business, a 22% increase in small business spending and a 13% improvement in Corporate Services volumes. - Spending per proprietary basic card in force increased 11%. - U.S. non-T&E-related volume categories (which represented approximately 68% of 3Q '05 U.S. billed business) grew 20%, while T&E volumes rose 13%. - U.S. airline-related volume, which represented approximately 12% of total U.S. volumes during the quarter, rose 12% as 13% transaction volume growth was suppressed by an approximately 1% lower average airline charge. - Excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation: - Worldwide billed business and spending per proprietary basic card in force increased 18% and 12%, respectively. - Total billed business outside the U.S. reflected double-digit proprietary growth in all regions, with the largest increases in Canada and Latin America. - Within our proprietary business, billed business outside the U.S. reflected 13% growth in consumer and small business spending, as well as a 15% increase in Corporate Services volumes. - Spending per proprietary basic card in force outside the U.S. rose 14%. - Worldwide airline volumes, which represented approximately 12% of total volumes during the quarter, increased 16% on 13% growth in transaction volume, and a 2% increase in the average airline charge. - CARDS IN FORCE: Rose 9% worldwide due to an increase of 7% in U.S. Card Services, 3% in International Card & Global Commercial Services and 36% in GNS. Continued robust card acquisitions within both the proprietary and GNS activities and strong average customer retention levels drove this change. - In the U.S. 1MM cards were added in the quarter; outside the U.S., 700K cards were added during the quarter. - - CARDMEMBER LENDING NET FINANCE CHARGE REVENUE: Increased 16% on 8% growth in average worldwide lending balances on an owned basis and a higher portfolio yield. - Annualized net finance charge revenue as a percentage of average loans in the worldwide portfolio was 9.2% in 3Q '05 versus 9.3% in 2Q '05 and 8.6% in 3Q '04. The increase versus last year reflects a lower proportion of the U.S. portfolio on introductory rates and increased finance charge rates, partially offset by rising funding costs. - - NET CARD FEES: Grew 8% primarily due to higher cards in force. In both 3Q '05 and 2Q '05, the average annual fee per proprietary card in force was $35 versus $34 in 3Q '04. - - TRAVEL COMMISSIONS AND FEES: Declined 1% as higher travel sales were partially offset by lower transaction fees as a greater proportion of bookings were made on-line. - - OTHER COMMISSIONS AND FEES: Increased 8% on greater volume-related foreign exchange conversion fees and higher card-related fees and assessments. - - SECURITIZATION INCOME, NET: Increased 20% on a greater average balance of securitized loans, a higher portfolio yield and a decrease in portfolio write-offs, partially offset by greater interest expense due to a higher coupon rate paid to certificate holders and an increase in the payment speed of the trust assets. Securitization income, net represents the non-credit provision components of the net gains and charges from securitization activities within the U.S. Card Services segment, the amortization and related impairment charges, if any, of the related interest-only strip, excess spread related to securitized loans, net finance charge revenue on retained interests in securitized loans, and servicing income, net of related discounts or fees. - During 3Q '05 and 3Q '04, results reflected net securitization gains, including the credit components, of $3MM ($2MM after-tax) and $9MM ($6MM after-tax), respectively. The average balance of Cardmember lending securitizations was $21.3B in 3Q '05, compared with $19.2B in 3Q '04. - - OTHER INVESTMENT AND INTEREST INCOME: Declined 1% due to lower investment portfolio spreads reflecting higher funding costs. - - OTHER REVENUES: Declined 11% in part due to lower ATM revenues resulting from the sale of the business in 3Q '04. -5-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED - - HUMAN RESOURCES EXPENSE: Increased 9% due to $77MM of severance costs, higher management incentives, including an additional year of incremental stock-based compensation expenses, merit increases and increased employee benefit costs. - - MARKETING, PROMOTION, REWARDS AND CARDMEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES: Increased 16%, reflecting higher marketing and promotion expenses and greater rewards costs. The increase in marketing and promotion expenses is due to the Company's ongoing global brand advertising campaign and our continued focus on business-building initiatives. The growth in rewards costs is attributable to volume growth, a higher redemption rate and strong cardmember loyalty program participation. - - PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES AND BENEFITS: Increased 33% as the charge card and lending provisions rose 45% and 56%, respectively, and the other provisions declined by 35%. The charge and lending growth reflects strong volume increases within both activities and higher provision rates, as well as a $49MM provision during the quarter to reflect the estimated costs related to Hurricane Katrina. The 3Q '04 Investment Certificate and Other Provision included a charge of $115MM related to a securitization reconciliation and a benefit of $60MM due to a reduction in merchant-related reserves. - CREDIT QUALITY: - Overall credit quality continued to perform well. - Reserve coverage ratios, which are in excess of 100% of past due balances, remained strong. - WORLDWIDE CHARGE CARD: * - The loss ratio increased versus last quarter and last year. Past due rates improved versus last year and were flat with last quarter. - WORLDWIDE LENDING:** - The write-off rate rose versus last year, but was down versus last quarter. Past due levels were flat with last year, but up from last quarter. * There are no off-balance sheet charge card securitizations. Therefore, "Owned Basis" and "Managed Basis" credit quality statistics for the charge card portfolio are the same. ** All lending statistics are presented here on a GAAP or "Owned Basis". "Managed Basis" credit quality statistics are available in the Third Quarter 2005 Earnings Release on the Consolidated Selected Statistical Information pages. Credit trends are generally consistent under both reporting methods. - - PROFESSIONAL SERVICES EXPENSES: Rose 6% reflecting increased technology costs related to higher business and service-related volumes. - - OCCUPANCY AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSES: Rose 6% primarily due to higher rent expense and the amortization of software costs. - - INTEREST: Rose 18% due to higher receivable balances and a higher effective cost of funds. - - COMMUNICATIONS: Decreased slightly versus last year. - - OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES: Decreased 13% due in part to lower expenses as a result of our 3Q '04 sale of the ATM business. -6-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - PRO FORMA ROE The Company's consolidated return on equity (ROE) is calculated on a trailing 12-month basis using reported net income over average total shareholder's equity (including discontinued operations). The Company also reports pro forma ROE, which is determined using trailing four quarters income from continuing operations (which excludes discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting changes) over reported shareholders' equity at period end. Management believes pro forma ROE is an important measure because it reflects performance of the Company's continuing businesses by excluding the impact of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. and American Express Tax and Business Services, Inc., which were disposed of as of September 30, 2005. *** MANAGED BASIS U.S. Card Services and International Card & Global Commercial Services segment results are presented on a managed basis and Global Network & Merchant Services and Corporate & Other segment results are presented on a GAAP basis. For U.S. Card Services, managed basis means the presentation assumes there have been no securitization transactions, i.e. all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the Company's balance sheet and income statements, respectively. The Company presents U.S. Card Services information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Asset securitization is just one of several ways for the Company to fund cardmember loans. Use of a managed basis presentation, including non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans, presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business, avoiding distortions due to the mix of funding sources at any particular point in time. The Company does not currently securitize international loans. Irrespective of the funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics, such as changes in delinquencies and write-off rates, for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant metrics in evaluating the Company's performance and can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The managed basis presentation for U.S. Card Services also reflects an increase to interest income recorded to evaluate tax exempt investments on a basis consistent with taxable investment securities. On a GAAP basis, interest income associated with tax exempt investments is recorded based on amounts earned. Accordingly, information presented on a managed basis assumes that tax exempt securities earned income at rates as if the securities produced taxable income with a corresponding increase in the provision for income taxes. The managed basis presentation for International Card & Global Commercial Services reflects a foreign exchange services reclassification of revenue earned related to the sale and purchase of foreign currencies as part of the foreign exchange business. On a GAAP basis, these revenues are included with other foreign exchange items that are reflected in other operating expenses. Accordingly, information presented on a managed basis assumes that the amounts earned are included in other revenue with a corresponding increase in other operating expenses. -7-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW CORPORATE & OTHER - - Net income of $24MM in 3Q '05 compared with a net expense of $16MM in 2Q '05 and $51MM in 3Q '04. - 3Q '05 reflects the $105MM tax benefit previously discussed, $51MM ($33MM after-tax) of reengineering costs and $3MM after-tax of spin-off related expenses. - 2Q '05 reflects a $54MM tax audit benefit, a $73MM ($47MM after-tax) benefit from 9/11-related insurance claims and $19MM ($12MM after-tax) of reengineering costs. In addition, $3MM and $2MM in after-tax, spin-related expenses previously included in Corporate & Other in 2Q'05 and 1Q'05, respectively, have been reclassified to discontinued operations this quarter to align with the 3Q'05 income statement presentation. -8-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW U.S. CARD SERVICES The following table compares and reconciles the GAAP basis U.S. Card Services income statements to the managed basis information, where different. Management views any net gains from securitizations as discretionary benefits to be used for card acquisition expenses, which are reflected in both marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services and other operating expenses. Consequently, the managed basis presentation assumes the impact of this net activity was offset by higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses of $2MM in 3Q '05 and $6MM in 3Q '04, and other operating expenses of $1MM in 3Q '05 and $3MM in 3Q '04. Accordingly, the incremental expenses, as well as the impact of the net lending securitization activity, are eliminated.
