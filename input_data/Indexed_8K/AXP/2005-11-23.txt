Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement On November 21, 2005, the Compensation and Benefits Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of American Express Company (the "Company") approved the Company's 2006 Pay-for-Performance Deferral Program (the "2006 Deferral Program"). A brief summary of the terms and conditions of the 2006 Deferral Program is set forth below and a copy of the 2006 Pay-for-Performance Deferral Program Guide is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report and is hereby incorporated by reference. The 2006 Deferral Program permits eligible senior level employees to defer payment of their 2006 base salary, cash bonus related to the 2006 performance year (to be paid in or about February 2007) or any eventual payout under the Portfolio Grant-XV Award (payable in or about February 2007) under the Company's 1998 Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that generally, the maximum total amount that a participant may defer into his or her deferral account from all sources under the 2006 Deferral Program is one times base salary. The program annually credits interest equivalents to, or reduces the value of, deferred amounts according to a schedule based on the reported annual return on equity ("ROE") of the Company. In adopting the 2006 Deferral Program, the Committee set the overall schedule of rates at which interest equivalents are credited to deferred amounts, such that the rates for amounts deferred under the 2006 Deferral Program range from 0% (if the Company's ROE for a given year is greater than 10% but less than or equal to 14%) to a maximum of 14% (if the Company's ROE for a given year is 35% or more). If the Company's annual ROE is 10% or less for a given year, then the balance maintained in a participant's 2006 deferral account will be reduced in value by an amount equal to the Company's ROE for such year less 11%. The Committee may adjust the schedule, prospectively or retroactively, in its sole discretion without a participant's prior consent or notice. If a participant elects to defer any compensation under the 2006 Deferral Program, he or she must defer such compensation for at least five years. In the event a participant's employment by the Company or any of its subsidiaries terminates prior to the end of the minimum five-year deferral period for any reason other than retirement, disability or death, then the participant's 2006 deferral account would be paid out in a lump sum as soon as practicable after termination of employment with interest equivalents credited or debited for the entire period of deferral at the lesser of (i) the initial deferred amount credited or debited annually at the ROE-based rate described above or (ii) the initial deferred amount credited annually with the rate of return on the applicable five-year U.S. Treasury note. In the event a participant's employment by the Company or any of its subsidiaries terminates on or after the end of the minimum five-year deferral period for any reason other than retirement, disability or death, then the participant's 2006 deferral account would be paid out in a lump sum with interest equivalents credited or debited annually using the ROE-based rate described above. In addition, payment of a participant's deferral account may be accelerated upon a change in control of the Company. The Committee may delay payment to a participant under the 2006 Deferral Program until such payment is fully deductible under Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, payment of a participant's 2006 deferral account following retirement or termination of the participant is subject to a six month delay, as required by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and the administrative guidance issued thereunder (the "AJCA"). The Committee may also administer, operate or amend the 2006 Deferral Program in conformity with the AJCA in an effort to maintain the effectiveness of deferral elections.

American Express Company 2006 PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE DEFERRAL PROGRAM GUIDE Table of Contents
American Express Company 2006 PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE DEFERRAL PROGRAM GUIDE Introduction These are the basic guidelines of the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors of American Express Company (the "Committee") concerning requests for deferred payment of: o any cash award related to the 2006 performance year (a "2006 Annual Incentive Award") otherwise payable on or about February 2007, under the American Express Annual Incentive Award Plan or any successor plan or plans (an "Incentive Plan");(a) o 2006 base salary otherwise payable in 2006 under the AXP Salary Deferral Plan or any successor plan or plans (a "Deferral Plan"); and o any eventual payout under the Portfolio Grant-XV Award granted on or about 2004 and otherwise payable on or about February 2007 ("PG-XV Award") under the American Express Company 1998 Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended and restated (the "1998 Plan").(b) A deferral of your 2006 Annual Incentive Award, 2006 base salary and/or PG-XV Award is part of the 2006 Pay-for-Performance Deferral Program (the "2006 Program"). Eligible employees will be notified about the 2006 Program. Generally, you are eligible if you are an "active" (as defined below) senior level employee (band 50 or above) who participates in the applicable Incentive Plan and: (i) is subject to U.S. income taxes; or (ii) is designated by the Company as an eligible U.S. Dollar-Paid Expatriate who is a U.S. Citizen or U.S. Greencard holder. If you are an eligible employee and the Company offers you the opportunity to participate in the 2006 Program, then you may request deferred payment of a 2006 Annual Incentive Award, 2006 base salary and/or PG-XV Award subject to the provisions of this Guide, the applicable Incentive Plan, the applicable Deferral Plan and the 1998 Plan. - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- (a) The Committee may include other incentive programs or awards in its sole discretion. References in this Guide to "2006 Annual Incentive Award" and "Incentive Plan" shall include such other incentive arrangements determined by the Committee. (b) The Committee may include other Performance Grants in its sole discretion. References in this Guide to "PG-XV" shall include such other Performance Grants determined by the Committee. -3-
You must be an "active" employee (i.e., providing services to the Company or an approved subsidiary) on December 31, 2005 and during the remainder of 2006 to participate in the 2006 Program. Employees who become newly eligible during 2006 and are offered the opportunity to participate in the 2006 Program by the Company may request deferred payment of their post-election 2006 base salary and the post-election portion of their 2006 Annual Incentive Award if they make their request to defer no later than 30 days after their first day of eligibility (e.g., date of employment for new hires). If your employee status changes to "inactive" during the year for any reason, including, but not limited to, severance, or if your employment terminates (for any reason, including, but not limited to, retirement, disability or death), all deferral elections will become immediately void except for any amounts already deferred prior to such change in status. If you elect to defer a portion of your base salary and your employee status changes to "inactive" (as described above) during the year, your bi-weekly base salary deductions will be discontinued and previous deductions will be credited to your account. In the case of a leave of absence, the bi-weekly base salary deductions in effect prior to the leave will resume when you return from leave to "active" status. Your initial deferral amount for the purposes of the 2006 Program, therefore, will be reduced. MODIFICATION OR TERMINATION OF 2006 PROGRAM Any terms and features of, and benefits and rights under, the 2006 Program and your deferral election may be interpreted, modified or terminated by the Committee in its sole discretion in any manner and at any time without your prior consent or notice (including, but not limited to, alignment with legislative and regulatory developments) provided that such interpretation, modification or termination shall not cause deferred amounts to fail to meet the requirement for favorable tax treatment pursuant to the AJCA, applicable regulations thereunder, and other IRS guidance. The ROE Formula Rate applied to your deferred balance may be changed, prospectively or retroactively, in the sole discretion of the Committee without your prior consent or notice. NEW FOR 2006 o Interest equivalents to be credited under the ROE formula rate have changed for the 2006 Program to reflect the adjusted ROE targets following the spin-off of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. by the Company during 2005. o As previously mentioned, Congress passed legislation (known as the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "AJCA")), which generally became effective in 2005 and made significant changes to the area of nonqualified deferred compensation. In December of 2004 and September of 2005, the IRS issued guidance on the application of the new rules applicable to nonqualified deferred compensation. As a result of this additional guidance, the following changes have been made for the 2006 Program: o Under the 2005 Program, employees were only allowed to make deferral elections for PG-XVI (payable in 2008) because it was unclear whether PG Awards would qualify as "performance-based -4-
compensation" under the rules and thereby qualify for later elections. Under the additional guidance, it appears at this time that PG Awards do qualify as performance-based compensation. Accordingly, the Company is returning to its prior practice of permitting deferral elections for PG Awards in the year before the final year of the applicable performance period. Therefore, the Company is allowing employees to make deferral elections with respect to PG-XV (payable in 2007) under the 2006 Program. o In the past, the Company has continued to treat individuals as employees during their serial severance period, and delayed distribution of their deferred amounts until the end of such period. The additional guidance makes clear that the Company may not treat individuals as employees during their severance periods for determining when the payments will commence, and whether the payments will follow the employee's election or distributed in a lump sum. Accordingly, the Company must now commence distributions of an employee's deferred amounts that are subject to the AJCA on his or her actual date of termination (subject to a six-month delay). Additionally, the Company will use the actual date of termination to determine whether payments will follow the employee's election or distributed in a lump sum. The Company will continue to define "retirement" for the 2006 Program and prior years' programs as the attainment of age 55 and 10 actual or deemed years of service. For existing deferred amounts that are not subject to the AJCA, the Company intends on continuing to administer the distribution of such amounts in accordance with its prior practice, to the extent such continued administration is permissible. o Despite the issuance of the additional guidance, many issues remain unclear and future guidance is expected to be issued in 2006. Accordingly, any terms and features of, and rights and benefits under, the 2006 Program and your deferral election may be interpreted, modified or terminated by the Committee in its sole discretion in any manner and at any time without your prior consent or notice (including, but not limited to, deferring the payment date and alignment with legislative and regulatory developments) in an effort to cause deferred amounts to meet the requirement for favorable tax treatment pursuant to the AJCA, applicable regulations thereunder, and other IRS guidance. o The Company has created a new online enrollment process for deferral elections under the 2006 Program. For the 2006 Program, employees may continue to make deferral elections manually by submitting paper forms. However, you are strongly encouraged to use the new online enrollment process instead. -5-
TIMING OF REQUEST Your request for deferral must be received on or before Saturday, December 31, 2005 and is irrevocable as of 11:59 PM EST on December 31, 2005. If your request for deferral form is not received by this date, the deferral election will not be effective. However, employees who become newly eligible during 2006 may request deferred payment of their post-election 2006 base salary and the post-election portion of their 2006 Annual Incentive Award if they make their request to defer no later than 30 days after their first day of eligibility (e.g., date of employment for a new hire). INITIAL DEFERRED AMOUNT You can request to defer from one or more of the following sources provided you defer a minimum of $5,000 from each source you select: o any 2006 Annual Incentive Award that would otherwise be payable for 2006 performance (e.g., otherwise payable on or about February 2007); o 2006 base salary; and/or o PG-XV Award otherwise payable on or about February 2007. The combined amounts that you elect to defer from your 2006 Annual Incentive Award, 2006 base salary and/or PG-XV Award is the "Initial Deferred Amount." The maximum total amount which you may elect to defer from your 2006 Annual Incentive Award, 2006 base salary and/or PG-XV award combined is 100% of your annual base salary as of the later of December 31, 2005 or the date that you become eligible to participate. However, the maximum total amount which employees who become newly eligible may elect to defer from their 2006 base salary is 100% of their post-election 2006 base salary. Important additional details on the "Initial Deferred Amount" are shown on page 14 of this Guide. PERIOD OF DEFERRAL You may request that payment(s) be deferred until one of the following (see also section on "Payout Provisions" on pages 9 to 11 of this Guide): o a specific date, at least five years from date of deferral (i.e., February 1, 2012 for base salary, Annual Incentive Award deferrals, and PG-XV deferrals) or later; or o your retirement (as defined below); or o a specified date after your retirement (but not later than 10 years after retirement). Your payment request is subject to the conditions described in this Guide. -6-
"RETIREMENT" "Retirement" means the date your employment terminates following your attainment of age 55 and 10 actual or deemed years of service with American Express Company or its affiliates. You will be considered to have terminated your employment as of your actual date of separation, and the Company will commence distribution of your 2006 deferrals using such date (subject to a six-month delay). SIX-MONTH DELAY Pursuant to the AJCA, payments to certain employees following retirement or termination must be delayed by six months. Given the difficulty in identifying affected participants, and to ensure compliance with this requirement and to protect participants from possible penalties under the AJCA, the Company will delay payments following retirement or termination to all participants by six-months. THEREFORE, REGARDLESS OF YOUR ELECTION OR AS OTHERWISE STATED IN THIS GUIDE, PAYMENTS TO ALL PARTICIPANTS FOLLOWING RETIREMENT OR TERMINATION WILL BE DELAYED BY SIX MONTHS. If the Company later determines based on additional IRS guidance that it can reasonably identify those employees who are subject to the required six-month delay, the Company may, to the extent permitted by the AJCA and additional guidance thereunder, amend this Guide to limit the six-month delay to only those participants for whom it is required under the AJCA. However, there is no guarantee that the Company can or will make such amendment, and you should not rely on the possibility of such an amendment in making your deferral elections. DEFERRAL BOOKKEEPING ACCOUNT A bookkeeping account will be established and maintained (for purposes of this Guide the "Deferral Bookkeeping Account") in your name and will initially be credited with your Initial Deferred Amount as of the applicable date (i.e., when amount would otherwise have been paid). "Interest" equivalents will be accrued on the Initial Deferred Amount and thereafter on the deferred balance in the account, as adjusted annually. "INTEREST" EQUIVALENTS ON DEFERRED AMOUNT The deferred balance is "credited" or "debited" with "interest" equivalents based on a schedule established by the Committee (the "ROE Formula Rate"), which is based on the Company's annual return on equity ("ROE"), as reported, subject to adjustment for major accounting changes as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion (see schedule on following page). THE ROE FORMULA RATE APPLIED TO YOUR DEFERRED BALANCE MAY BE CHANGED, PROSPECTIVELY OR RETROACTIVELY, IN THE SOLE DISCRETION OF THE COMMITTEE WITHOUT YOUR PRIOR CONSENT OR NOTICE. -7-

PAYOUT PROVISIONS You may request that the payment of the amount credited to your Deferral Bookkeeping Account begin: o on the first day of a specific month and year, at least five years from date of deferral (i.e., February 1, 2012 for base salary, Annual Incentive Award deferrals and PG-XV deferrals) or later; or o upon your retirement; or o on the first day of a specific month and year after retirement (but no later than 10 years after retirement). Payments may be made in a lump sum or in 2 to 15 approximately equal annual installments. Commencement of payment may be subject to a six-month delay. IF YOU CHOOSE A LUMP SUM PAYMENT, interest equivalents for the year in which payment occurs will be credited or debited through the elected payment date or event using the ROE Formula Rate for the prior year. If you choose annual installments, the balance remaining after each installment payment will continue to be credited or debited with interest equivalents based on the ROE Formula Rate in effect under the Program for that year, or as otherwise determined by the Committee. (In the latter case, references in this Guide to "ROE Formula Rate" and related value calculations would refer to such other rate or calculation as determined by the Committee.) Generally, each annual installment payment is calculated using an "annuity due" formula, which assumes, for calculation purposes, that the applicable ROE Formula Rate remains constant for the remainder of the elected payment schedule. Because the actual ROE and the ROE Formula Rate could fluctuate, your actual payments could vary from year to year. The first installment payment will be made on the first day of the first month following the elected payment date or event, or as administratively feasible thereafter, and the interest equivalents for that year will be credited or debited through the elected payment date or event using the ROE Formula Rate for the prior year. Thus, the crediting rate applied for an election or event (as defined) effective December 1 will reflect the Rate of the year beginning 23 months earlier, and the crediting rate applied for an election of January 1 will reflect the rate of the year beginning 12 months earlier. The remaining installment payments will be made on or about March 31st of each year thereafter with each payment credited or debited using the ROE formula rate for the prior year. RETIREMENT OR DISABILITY If your employment by American Express Company and its affiliates terminates at any time by reason of "retirement" (as defined above) or by reason of "disability" (as defined under the AJCA), the amount credited to your Deferral Bookkeeping Account will be paid out as soon as practicable following the time and in the manner you have elected (but not later than 10 years following retirement, and subject to a six-month delay), with interest equivalents credited or debited as described above. -9-
DEATH If you die before installment payments begin or are completed, your designated beneficiary (see Beneficiary Designation Form in the Appendix) or the legal representatives of your estate (if you do not designate a beneficiary or if your designated beneficiary does not survive you) will receive a lump sum as soon as practicable after your death, of the amount credited to your Deferral Bookkeeping Account, with interest equivalents credited or debited, using the ROE Formula Rate for the prior year. OTHER TERMINATION If your employment by American Express Company and its affiliates terminates for any reason other than retirement, disability or death, your Deferral Bookkeeping Account will be paid out in a lump sum as soon as practicable after termination of employment (subject to a six-month delay) with interest equivalents credited or debited for the entire period of deferral as described below: o for terminations prior to the end of the minimum 5-year deferral period the lesser of: (i) the initial deferred amount credited or debited annually at the ROE Formula Rate; or (ii) the initial deferred amount credited annually with the rate of return on the applicable 5-year U.S. Treasury Note, with credits or debits through your termination date (for information on the deferral period, please refer to page 6 of this Guide); or o for terminations on or after the minimum 5-year deferral period: credited or debited annually using the ROE Formula Rate, with credits or debits through your termination date. CHANGE IN CONTROL Regardless of the payout method you choose, payment of your deferral Bookkeeping Account may be accelerated upon a "Change in Control" of American Express Company. Generally, subject to governing documents, a "Change in Control" includes the acquisition of beneficial ownership by certain persons of 25% or more of the Company's common shares or all outstanding voting securities of the Company, the current Board members of the Company cease to constitute a majority thereof or certain reorganizations, mergers, consolidations, liquidations or sales of all or substantially all of the Company's assets. The timing of the payout, and the definition of a "Change in Control" are governed by the provisions of the applicable annual and long-term incentive plans, Appendix B and Committee actions. Refer to these documents for additional information. CERTAIN OTHER LIMITATIONS Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at the time that payment would otherwise be made to you under the Program, (i) you are an executive officer (within the meaning of Rule 3b-7 (or any successor rule) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended from time to time) of the Company (an "Executive Officer"), or (ii) payment would be subject to the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or any successor provision) such that your employer would lose some or all of the federal income tax deduction for such payment, then such payment to you shall be further deferred (unless otherwise -10-
determined by the Committee in its sole discretion) until the first taxable year in which (x) you are no longer an Executive Officer and (y) you are no longer subject to such limitations in clause (ii) above, with appropriate income equivalents being credited or debited to your Deferral Bookkeeping Account under the Program during the additional period of deferral. U.S. FEDERAL/STATE/LOCAL INCOME TAX YOU ARE STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT WITH YOUR OWN PERSONAL FINANCIAL, LEGAL AND TAX ADVISORS ON THESE AND ANY OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES. Recent Federal Administrative Guidance: As previously mentioned, Congress passed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "AJCA"), which generally became effective in 2005 and made significant changes to the area of nonqualified deferred compensation. The AJCA principally affects standards for deferral elections and distributions. Failure to satisfy the requirements of AJCA will result in the imposition of taxes, back interest, and an additional 20% penalty. In addition, the Company is now required to annually report deferred amounts on a participant's W-2 or 1099 for the year deferred, even if not currently includable in income for federal tax purposes. In order to comply with the new rules, the Committee may, in its sole discretion in any manner and at any time without your prior consent or notice, decide to administer, operate, or amend the Program in conformity with the AJCA in an effort to maintain the effectiveness of deferral elections. See the section "Modification or Termination of 2006 Program" on page 4 of this Guide. If under the AJCA or future legislative or administrative guidance your deferral elections are deemed to be ineffective or if the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") otherwise does not give effect to your deferral election, either when made, or at a later date, this may result in the Initial Deferred Amount being included in your income in the year it is otherwise payable, and the inclusion of interest equivalents in your income in the year such interest equivalents are credited. These income amounts would be subject to current tax and tax withholding and you would also have to pay interest on any underpayment of tax together with an additional 20% penalty on compensation which is required to be included in income. -11-
U.S. SOCIAL SECURITY TAX For U.S. Social Security (FICA) tax purposes, the Initial Deferred Amount will be subject to FICA tax in the year that your 2006 Annual Incentive Award, 2006 base salary and/or PG Awards would otherwise be payable as if the deferral had not taken place. Thus, you will be subject to FICA tax on the initial deferral amounts. As background, FICA tax consists of two components: (i) old-age, survivors and disability insurance tax assessed at 6.2% on compensation up to $94,200 for 2006; and (ii) Medicare tax assessed at a rate of 1.45% on all applicable compensation. You should leave enough "net pay" in one or more of: your 2006 Annual Incentive Award; 2006 base salary and/or PG Award, to cover the total FICA tax amounts which will be taken at the time of deferral as well as all other pre- and post-tax deductions. In addition, premium interest earned on deferred compensation balances will be subject to FICA tax when vested. "Premium" interest consists of the excess of a program's annual interest rate over a benchmark rate. The highest rate approved by the IRS at this time is the Moody's Average Corporate Bond Yield, which the Company will use to calculate premium interest subject to FICA. Therefore, for example, if the crediting rate for 2006 were 10% and the Moody's rate for that year were 6%, the 4% premium interest credited would be subject to FICA when vested. Under the 2006 Program, interest equivalents vest when the 5-year employment/deferral period is completed for each deferral amount you elect or when you become "retirement" eligible (worldwide definition under the Program of at least 55 years of age with at least 10 years of service). As each 5-year employment/deferral period following a deferral election is completed, the credited interest equivalents applicable to that election vest and the premium portion then becomes subject to FICA, to be withheld in March of the vesting year (e.g., premium interest equivalents credited under the 2006 Program for an AIA deferral will become subject to FICA tax withholding in 3/2012). However, in the year you become retirement eligible, all unvested interest equivalents for all deferral elections vest, and the premium portion then becomes subject to FICA tax, to be withheld in March of the following year (e.g., if an employee becomes retirement eligible in 2007, the premium interest equivalents credited under the 2006 Program will become subject to FICA tax withholding in 3/2008). THE TWO FOREGOING SECTIONS ARE NOT INTENDED AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS TAX ADVICE. YOU ARE STRONGLY URGED TO REVIEW ALL ASPECTS OF A POSSIBLE DEFERRAL WITH YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR, INCLUDING ALL U.S. FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES, IN LIGHT OF YOUR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. IF YOU ARE WORKING OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND/OR ARE SUBJECT TO FOREIGN TAX LAWS, IT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU REVIEW A POSSIBLE DEFERRAL WITH YOUR TAX ADVISOR. -12-
IRREVOCABILITY OF DEFERRAL REQUESTS; HARDSHIP WITHDRAWALS A request for deferred payment of your 2006 Annual Incentive Award, 2006 base salary and/or PG-XV Award is irrevocable. You may not ask for different terms. An exception to this rule is possible subject to the provisions of the Guide and applicable Deferral Document, only if the occurrence of an "unforeseeable emergency" (as defined under the AJCA) is demonstrated to, and approved by, the Committee. Any withdrawal can never be returned to your Deferral Bookkeeping Account and will be subject to U.S. income tax and other taxes in the year it is received by you, as described in more detail above. Under these standards, hardship withdrawals will only be allowed under rare and unusual circumstances and should not be relied upon for financial planning purposes. SOME CAVEATS Since the request to defer payment of your 2006 Annual Incentive Award, 2006 base salary and/or PG-XV Award, once approved, is irrevocable, the decision to do so requires careful personal financial planning. Please carefully review your planned deferral with your personal financial, legal and tax planning advisors prior to making such a request. Among the considerations may be: the impact on your participation in U.S. benefit plans (see pages 15 to 16 of this Guide); your cashflow needs; and planning for stock option exercises or stock purchases (e.g., to achieve your stock ownership guideline level, if you have been notified of participation in that program). THE DEFERRAL PROGRAM IS UNFUNDED AND ALL PAYMENTS ARE MADE OUT OF THE GENERAL ASSETS OF YOUR EMPLOYER. YOUR EMPLOYER IS NOT REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ANY SPECIAL OR SEPARATE FUND OR TO MAKE ANY OTHER SEGREGATION OF ASSETS TO ASSURE THE PAYMENT OF ANY AMOUNT UNDER THE PROGRAM. PAYMENTS UNDER THE PROGRAM ARE NEITHER SUBORDINATE NOR SUPERIOR TO THE CLAIMS OF THE EMPLOYER'S GENERAL CREDITORS. AMOUNTS DEFERRED UNDER THE PROGRAM MAY BE USED FOR ANY CORPORATE PURPOSE BY YOUR EMPLOYER; YOU AND ANYONE CLAIMING UNDER OR THROUGH YOU WILL, OF COURSE, HAVE NO INTEREST IN ANY SUCH CORPORATE ASSETS OR IN ANY PROCEEDS THEREFROM. As a condition to your eligibility to defer your 2006 Annual Incentive Award, 2006 base salary and/or PG-XV Award, it is understood and agreed that you will provide complete and valid information, signatures and consents on all documents, and you will take such other actions that the employer determines may be necessary or desirable. It is understood that a deferral election does not constitute a contract or an agreement, express or implied, of your continued employment by the Company or its affiliates for any period of time. All deferrals are subject to the provisions of this Guide, the applicable Incentive Plan document, the applicable Deferral Plan document, the 1998 Plan document, and the PG-XV Award agreement. You should carefully review the applicable plan documents before making your deferral decision. Your applicable Incentive Plan document, Deferral Plan document and the 1998 Plan document are available upon request. - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- YOU SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER, IN CONSULTATION WITH YOUR ADVISORS, THE IMPACT OF THE AJCA AND THE POSSIBILITY OF FUTURE LEGISLATIVE OR INTERPRETIVE CHANGES IN THE TAX LAW, WHICH MIGHT AFFECT THE TAXATION OF DEFERRED AMOUNTS AND/OR THE INTEREST EQUIVALENTS CREDITED OR DEBITED THEREON. -13-
