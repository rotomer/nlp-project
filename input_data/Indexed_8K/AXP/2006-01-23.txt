New York - January 23, 2006 - AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY today reported fourth quarter income from continuing operations of $751 million, up 12 percent from $669 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations rose to $0.60, up 13 percent from $0.53 a year ago. As previously reported, the Company spun-off or sold certain businesses, including Ameriprise Financial, Inc., in the third quarter of 2005. Including spin-off costs and prior year results for those businesses, net income totaled $745 million in the fourth quarter, down 17 percent from $896 million a year ago. Earnings per share on a diluted basis decreased to $0.59, down 17 percent from $0.71. The Company's reported return on equity (ROE) was 25.4 percent, up from 22.0 percent a year ago. Pro forma ROE, which is based on continuing operations, was 31.5 percent. (FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT PRO FORMA ROE, SEE THE "PRO FORMA ROE" SECTION BELOW.) Consolidated revenues rose 9 percent to $6.4 billion, up from $5.9 billion a year ago. Consolidated expenses totaled $5.5 billion, up 10 percent from $5.0 billion a year ago. "Fourth quarter results from continuing operations met or exceeded our long-term targets for earnings, revenues and, on a pro forma basis, return on equity. Higher spending by affluent consumers, small businesses and corporate Cardmembers more than offset the impact of an industry-wide spike in bankruptcy filings before new legislation went into effect last October," said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive. "We continued to invest aggressively in business building initiatives throughout the Company. New product introductions, a global brand advertising campaign and expanded card acquisition programs helped us to add two million cards-in-force during the last three months. Spending on American Express cards grew 15 percent. "Marketing-related spending rose to a record $1.6 billion, and we stepped up our investment in technology platforms during the quarter to support a pipeline that continues to broaden the product choice we offer to customers. -2-
"While marketing expense was below our earlier estimates, we were able to take full advantage of all the major opportunities we targeted for the quarter and generate results that outpaced our major competitors. "In addition, our network business took several major steps forward just before year-end when Citibank began issuing its first American Express-branded cards and we signed partnership agreements with Bank of America and HSBC. The momentum continued with last week's announcement of a similar agreement with GE Consumer Finance. All in all, American Express is entering 2006 in excellent competitive position." The quarter's income from continuing operations included substantially higher provisions for loan losses primarily related to the increased bankruptcy petitions mentioned above. Other significant items in the quarter included tax benefits of $60 million primarily related to finalizing state tax returns, and re-engineering costs of $65 million ($42 million after-tax). Significant items in the year-ago period included a $117 million net gain ($76 million after-tax) on the sale of a small business financing unit and a $99 million charge ($64 million after-tax) related to the restructuring of the Company's business travel unit, international banking operations and certain finance functions. For the full year, American Express reported income from continuing operations before accounting change of $3.2 billion, up 20 percent from $2.7 billion a year ago. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations rose to $2.56, up 22 percent from $2.09 a year ago. Net income was $3.7 billion, up 8 percent from $3.4 billion a year ago. Earnings per share on a diluted basis rose to $2.97, up 11 percent from $2.68. FOURTH QUARTER REVENUES AND EXPENSES The increase in quarterly revenues reflected higher discount revenue, up 13 percent as a result of a 15 percent increase in cardmember spending. Average cardmember spending rose 7 percent and total cards-in-force were up -3-
9 percent. The benefits of overall higher cardmember spending were partially offset by a slightly lower average discount rate and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Net finance charge revenue increased 25 percent, driven by a 19 percent growth in average cardmember loan balances. Fourth quarter expenses reflected a 34 percent higher provision for losses and benefits, as well as an 11 percent increase in marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Loss from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled $6 million. The year ago period reflects income from discontinued operations of $227 million primarily related to the results from Ameriprise, which is no longer part of American Express. SEGMENT RESULTS The following discussion of fourth quarter results presents U.S. Card Services segment results on a "managed basis," as if there had been no cardmember lending securitization transactions and to reflect certain tax-exempt investment income as if it had been earned on a taxable basis. In addition, International Card & Global Commercial Services reflects a reclassification of certain foreign exchange services, as revenues on a managed basis. For these business segments, this is the basis used by management to evaluate operations. For further information about managed basis and reconciliation of GAAP and managed information, see the "Managed Basis" section below. The Global Network & Merchant Services, and Corporate & Other segment results below are presented on a GAAP basis. U.S. CARD SERVICES reported fourth quarter net income of $411 million, up 13 percent from $363 million a year ago. Total revenues for the fourth quarter increased 14 percent to $3.5 billion, reflecting continued strong growth in spending and borrowing on U.S. consumer and small business cards. -4-
Total expenses increased 15 percent. The provision for losses increased 32 percent, reflecting the impact of the previously mentioned bankruptcies and a higher level of loans outstanding. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses increased 12 percent, reflecting greater rewards costs and higher marketing and promotion expenses. For the full year 2005, U.S. Card Services reported net income of $1.8 billion, up 21 percent from $1.5 billion a year ago. INTERNATIONAL CARD & GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES reported fourth quarter net income of $241 million, up 30 percent from $184 million a year ago. Total revenues for the fourth quarter increased 2 percent over the year-ago period to $2.4 billion. The impact of higher spending and borrowing by Cardmembers was partially offset by a decline in travel commissions and fees. Fourth quarter total expenses were essentially unchanged from a year ago. The provision for losses and benefits rose 43 percent due to higher provision rates and volume. This increase was offset by a 6 percent decrease in human resource and other operating expenses, reflecting lower restructuring and re-engineering costs and the benefits of prior re-engineering activities. For the full year 2005, International Card & Global Commercial Services reported net income of $934 million, up 19 percent from $781 million a year ago. GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES reported fourth quarter net income of $159 million, up 19 percent from $134 million a year ago. Total revenues for the fourth quarter increased 6 percent over year-ago levels to $745 million. The increase reflects continued strong growth in billed business, offset by the impact of the decline in discount rate, which is largely allocated to this segment and includes costs associated with investments in strategic merchant partnerships. Bank partners that issue cards on the American Express network added close to 1 million cards in the quarter. Spending on bank-issued American Express cards increased more than 30 percent from a year ago. -5-
Total expenses were essentially flat. Marketing and promotion increased 35 percent, primarily reflecting higher company-wide brand-related advertising, offset by a decrease in other operating expenses. For the full year 2005, Global Network & Merchant Services reported net income of $564 million, down 2 percent from $574 million a year ago. The decline reflects the cost of an expanded company-wide brand advertising campaign in 2005 and a reduction in merchant-related reserves in 2004. CORPORATE & OTHER reported fourth quarter net expenses of $60 million, compared with $12 million a year ago. The year-ago results primarily reflected the benefit of the previously mentioned sale of the Company's small business financing unit. Net expenses for 2005 were $111 million compared with $187 million a year ago. The 2005 results reflect certain tax benefits. *** -6-
MANAGED BASIS For U.S. Card Services, managed basis means the presentation assumes there have been no securitization transactions, i.e. all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the Company's balance sheet and income statements, respectively. The Company presents U.S. Card Services information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Asset securitization is just one of several ways for the Company to fund cardmember loans. Use of a managed basis presentation, including non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans, presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business, avoiding distortions due to the mix of funding sources at any particular point in time. The Company does not currently securitize international loans. Irrespective of the funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics, such as changes in delinquencies and write-off rates, for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant in evaluating the Company's performance and can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The managed basis presentation for U.S. Card Services also reflects an increase to interest income recorded to enable management to evaluate tax exempt investments on a basis consistent with taxable investment securities. On a GAAP basis interest income associated with tax exempt investments is recorded based on amounts earned. Accordingly, information presented on a managed basis assumes that tax exempt securities earned income at rates as if the securities produced taxable income with a corresponding increase in the provision for income taxes. The managed basis presentation for International Card & Global Commercial Services reflects a foreign exchange services reclassification for revenue earned related to the sale and purchase of foreign currencies as part of the foreign exchange business. On a GAAP basis, these revenues are included with other foreign exchange items that are reflected in other operating expenses. Accordingly, information presented on a managed basis assumes that the amounts earned are included in other revenue with a corresponding increase in other operating expenses. -7-

PRO FORMA ROE The Company's consolidated return on equity (ROE) is calculated on a trailing 12-month basis using reported net income over average total shareholder's equity (including discontinued operations). The Company also reports pro forma ROE, which is determined on a trailing 12-month basis using income from continuing operations (which excludes discontinued operations) over the average of the month-end shareholders' equity at September 30, 2005 through December 31, 2005. Management believes pro forma ROE is an important measure because it reflects performance of the Company's continuing businesses by excluding the impact of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. and American Express Tax and Business Services, Inc., which were disposed of as of September 30, 2005. ROE Pro Forma ROE - --------------------------------- --------------------------------------- Trailing 12-months net income: Trailing four quarters income from $3.7 billion continuing operations: $3.2 billion Trailing 12-months average Average month-end shareholders' equity total shareholders' equity: for the quarter ending Dec. 31, 2005: $14.7 billion $10.2 billion ROE: 25.4% Pro forma ROE: 31.5% *** American Express Company (www.americanexpress.com) is a leading global payments, network and travel company founded in 1850.

(Preliminary) U.S. CARD SERVICES SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION Quarters Ended December 31, (Millions) The tables above reconcile the GAAP basis for certain income statement line items to the managed basis information, where different. Securitization income, net represents the non-credit provision components of the net gains and charges from securitization activities, the amortization and related impairment charges, if any, of the related interest-only strip, excess spread related to securitized loans, net finance charge revenue on retained interests in securitized loans and servicing income, net of related discounts or fees. Management views any net gains from securitizations as discretionary benefits to be used for card acquisition expenses, which are reflected in both marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses and other operating expenses. Consequently, the managed Selected Financial Information above for the quarters ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 assumes that gains from new issuances and charges from the amortization and maturities of outstanding lending securitization transactions of $11 million are offset by higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses of $6 million and other operating expenses of $5 million. Accordingly, the incremental expenses, as well as the impact of this net activity, have been eliminated. The tax equivalent effect represents an increase to interest income recorded to enable management to evaluate tax exempt investments on a basis consistent with taxable investment securities. On a GAAP basis, interest income associated with tax exempt investments is recorded based on amounts earned. Accordingly, the managed Selected Financial Information above for the quarters ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 assumes that tax exempt securities earned income at rates as if the securities produced taxable income with a corresponding increase in the provision for income taxes. # - Denotes a variance of more than 100%. -13-

Consequently, the managed Selected Financial Information above for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 assumes that gains from new issuances and charges from the amortization and maturities of outstanding lending securitization transactions of $21 million and $26 million, respectively, are offset by higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses of $13 million and $16 million, respectively, and other operating expenses of $8 million and $10 million, respectively. Accordingly, the incremental expenses, as well as the impact of this net activity, have been eliminated. The tax equivalent effect represents an increase to interest income recorded to enable management to evaluate tax exempt investments on a basis consistent with taxable investment securities. On a GAAP basis, interest income associated with tax exempt investments is recorded based on amounts earned. Accordingly, the managed Selected Financial Information above for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 assumes that tax exempt securities earned income at rates as if the securities produced taxable income with a corresponding increase in the provision for income taxes. -14-

EXHIBIT 99.3 [LOGO OF AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY] 2005 FOURTH QUARTER/FULL YEAR EARNINGS SUPPLEMENT The enclosed summary should be read in conjunction with the text and statistical tables included in American Express Company's (the "Company" or "AXP") Fourth Quarter/Full Year 2005 Earnings Release. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This presentation contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of the date on which they are made. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, including the Company's financial and other goals, are set forth on pages 71-73 in the Company's 2004 Annual Report to Shareholders and in its 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and other reports, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FOURTH QUARTER 2005 HIGHLIGHTS o Fourth quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.60 increased 13% versus $0.53 last year. Total revenues rose 9%. For the trailing 12 months, including discontinued operations, ROE was 25%. - - 4Q `05 Income from continuing operations included: -- A $60MM tax benefit primarily related to the finalization of state tax returns; -- A $123MM ($80MM after-tax) increase in the GAAP provision for losses, or a $192MM ($125MM after-tax) increase in the provision on a managed basis, within the U.S. Card Services ("USCS") segment, reflecting substantially higher write-offs related to increased bankruptcy filings resulting from the October 17, 2005 change in bankruptcy legislation, and higher volumes; -- $65MM ($42MM after-tax) of reengineering costs, in our business travel and technology functions. $54MM of these costs were recorded within the International Card & Global Commercial Services ("ICGCS") segment, $10MM were related to the Corporate & Other segment, and $1MM was related to the Global Network & Merchant Services ("GNMS") segment. - - 4Q '04 Income from continuing operations included: -- A $117MM ($76MM after-tax) net gain in connection with the sale on December 1, 2004 of the equipment leasing product line managed within the Company's small business financing unit; and -- $99MM ($64MM after-tax) in reengineering charges related to restructuring efforts in our business travel, finance and technology, and international operations areas. - - On September 30, 2005, the Company completed the distribution of all of the outstanding shares of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (formerly American Express Financial Advisors) to its shareholders. This non-cash distribution was tax-free to the Company's shareholders. In addition, during the third quarter of 2005, the Company sold its Tax and Business Services ("TBS") business. The operating results and assets and liabilities related to businesses spun-off or sold have been included in discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. -- 4Q '05 results reflected a $6MM loss related to discontinued operations versus $227MM of income last year. Including discontinued operations, diluted EPS on a net income basis of $0.59 decreased 17%. - - The company's reported return on equity (ROE) was 25%, up from 22% a year ago. This ratio is determined on a trailing 12-month basis using net income and total average shareholders' equity (including discontinued operations). Pro forma ROE, which is determined using trailing four quarters income from continuing operations (which excludes discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting changes) over average month-end shareholders' equity for the quarter ending December 31, 2005 was 31%. See "Supplemental Information - Pro Forma ROE" discussion below. o Compared with the fourth quarter of 2004: - - Worldwide billed business increased 15% on continued strong growth within both the proprietary and network businesses. A comparatively stronger U.S. dollar reduced the reported worldwide growth rate by 1%. - - Worldwide cards in force of 71.0MM increased 9%, up 5.6MM from last year and 2.0MM during 4Q `05, as proprietary and network card growth remained particularly strong. - - Worldwide average spending per proprietary basic card in force increased 7% versus last year despite the suppressing effect of substantial card additions over the past year and the translation effect of a stronger dollar; - - Worldwide lending balances of $33.1B on an owned basis increased 23%; on a managed basis, worldwide lending balances of $54.3B were up 15%; and - - Underlying card credit quality, excluding the bankruptcy legislation effect, continued to be well-controlled and reserve coverage ratios remained strong. o Additional items of note included: - - Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services costs increased 11% versus 4Q '04, reflecting greater rewards costs and higher marketing and promotion expenses. Marketing expenses rose due to continuing costs related to the Company's ongoing global "My Life, My Card (SM)" advertising campaign, and various business building initiatives, including the expansion of our product portfolio. Rewards costs increased, reflecting volume growth, a higher redemption rate, and strong cardmember loyalty program participation. The total expense was at a historically high level, increasing $161MM vs. 4Q '04 and $89MM vs. 3Q '05. However, the 11% growth rate vs. 4Q '04 was lower than the 16% growth previously forecasted. The approximately $70MM shortfall versus our expectation reflected a number of items. Examples include: -- Certain expenses originally forecast to be within the marketing and promotion category that were subsequently recorded in other lines within the income statement; -- Certain partnership-related initiatives originally anticipated for the quarter that are now scheduled for 2006; and -- The impact of a comparatively stronger dollar on the translation of spending in other currencies. Overall business building expenses for the quarter also included an increase in technology development expenditures, which rose 24%, or approximately $30MM, from 4Q '04. These investments were directed toward activities that support our new product and servicing capabilities. The strong metric performance during the quarter underlines the continued effectiveness of the Company's overall business building expenditures. -1-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FOURTH QUARTER 2005 HIGHLIGHTS - - The Company's reengineering initiatives delivered in excess of $1B of additional benefits this year, including significant carry-over benefits from certain initiatives begun in prior periods. Revenue-related reengineering activities are driving a significant portion of the total benefits, representing more than 25% of the benefits delivered in 4Q '05 and during the full year. - - As previously disclosed, the Company decided to expense stock options beginning in 1Q '03 and use restricted stock awards in place of stock options for middle management. As a result, the 4Q `05 4% decrease in human resources expense includes the impact of incremental annual option grant expense, increased levels of restricted stock awards and other related compensation changes. The impact of these changes and higher management incentive costs, merit increases and larger benefit costs were more than offset by lower severance costs and reengineering benefits. In addition, the Company elected to adopt SFAS 123R, effective July 1, 2005. The impact of adoption was immaterial since the Company has been expensing share based awards granted after January 1, 2003 under the provisions of SFAS 123. - -- Compared with last year, the total employee count within continuing operations of 65,600 decreased by 700 employees or 1%; compared with last quarter, the employee count increased by 300. o During the quarter, American Express continued to invest in growth opportunities through expanded products and services. In our proprietary business, we: - - Launched One from American Express(SM), a card product enabling cardmembers to save with every purchase with a percentage of spending contributed to a high-yield savings account, as well as the option to contribute extra funds from checking, savings or brokerage accounts at any time; - - Announced an agreement with WellChoice, Inc., the parent company of Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, to offer a healthcare payment solution including a consumer-directed health plan, a Health Savings Account (HSA) from American Express Bank, FSB, and a new card product providing access to HSA funds, the American Express HealthPay Plus(SM) Card; - - Launched Clear from American Express(SM), a new credit card with no fees, automatic rewards and the ability to pay over time as well as benefits and services to help consumers better manage their finances; - - Announced a partnership with The Knot, Inc. to launch two co-branded credit cards specifically targeted to engaged couples and newlyweds; - - Invited select, high-spending cardmembers in Singapore to obtain an American Express Centurion Card, as part of its inaugural launch in this market; and - - Expanded the participants in the OPEN Savings Program(SM) to include such partners as Courtyard by Marriott(R), FedEx Kinko's Office and Print Centers, and Hyatt Hotels & Resorts(R). In our Global Network Services business, we: - - Launched five new card products in the U.S. as part of our partnership with Citigroup, Inc., including the Citi(R)/Platinum, Citi(R) Dividend, Citi(R)/ AAdvantage(R), Citi PremierPass(R) and the Citi(R) Diamond Preferred Rewards American Express(R) Cards; - - Announced a partnership with Bank of America to issue and market jointly branded American Express Cards in the U.S., while also affirming the continuation of our existing partnership with MBNA after the completion of its acquisition by Bank of America; - - Announced a partnership with HSBC - North America Holdings, Inc. to offer American Express branded cards in the United States; - - Launched the first American Express Cards in Russia, denominated in both rubles and U.S. dollars, as part of our partnership with Russian Standard Bank; - - Partnered with Nuevo Banco Comercial to issue American Express cards in Uruguay, as well as acquire and service merchants on our network; and - - Partnered with BANCPOST to launch and exclusively offer the first American Express credit cards in Romania. In other activities, we: - - Entered into an exclusive marketing agreement with Solver, a Microsoft Certified Partner, to license and sell American Express' investment optimization resource allocation methodology and software platform to Fortune 1000 companies. -2-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FOURTH QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED # Denotes variance greater than 100%. o Income from continuing operations increased 12% to $751MM. - - 4Q `05 Income from continuing operations included: -- A $60MM tax benefit primarily related to the finalization of state tax returns; -- A $123MM ($80MM after-tax) increase in the GAAP provision for losses, or a $192MM ($125MM after-tax) increase in the provision on a managed basis, within the USCS segment reflecting substantially higher write-offs related to increased bankruptcy filings resulting from the October 17, 2005 change in bankruptcy legislation, and higher volumes; and -- $65MM ($42MM after-tax) of reengineering costs in our business travel and technology functions. $54MM of these costs were recorded within the ICGCS segment, $10MM were related to the Corporate & Other segment, and $1MM was related to the GNMS segment. - - 4Q '04 Income from continuing operations included: -- A $117MM ($76MM after-tax) net gain in connection with the sale on December 1, 2004 of the equipment leasing product line managed within the Company's small business financing unit; and -- $99MM ($64MM after-tax) in reengineering charges related to restructuring efforts in our business travel, finance and technology, and international operations areas. -3-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FOURTH QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED o Net Income including discontinued operations decreased 17% to $745MM. - - 4Q '05 loss from discontinued operations was $6MM after-tax versus income of $227MM last year. o SHARE REPURCHASES: During 4Q '05, 4MM shares were repurchased versus 8MM shares in 3Q '05 and 15MM shares in 4Q `04. Repurchases during the quarter and full year reflect a more measured approach towards repurchase activity in light of the capital implications of the spin-off of Ameriprise. Since the inception of repurchase programs in December 1994, 530MM shares have been acquired under cumulative Board authorizations to repurchase up to 570MM shares, including purchases made under agreements with third parties. o CONSOLIDATED REVENUES: Consolidated revenues increased 9% reflecting increases versus last year of 13% within USCS, 3% within ICGCS and 6% within GNMS. Revenues increased due to higher discount revenues, increased Cardmember lending net finance charge revenue, greater other revenues, increased net card fees, higher other commissions and fees, and greater other investment and interest income, partially offset by lower travel commissions and fees and a decline in securitization income, net. Translation of foreign currency reduced the 9% revenue growth rate by 1%. o CONSOLIDATED EXPENSES: Consolidated expenses increased 10%, reflecting increases versus last year of 14% within USCS and 2% within GNMS, respectively, and expenses within ICGCS that were unchanged versus last year. Expense growth reflected higher provision for losses and benefits, increased marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services costs, greater other expenses, higher professional services expenses, greater interest costs and larger occupancy and equipment costs, partially offset by lower human resources expenses and a decline in communication costs. Translation of foreign currency reduced the 10% expense growth rate by 1%. o PRE-TAX MARGIN: Was 14.9% in 4Q '05 compared with 17.8% in 3Q '05 and 15.6% in 4Q '04. o EFFECTIVE TAX RATE: Was 22% in 4Q '05, as compared to 20% in 3Q '05 and 27% in 4Q '04. The 4Q '05 tax rate reflects the $60MM benefit primarily related to the finalization of state tax returns previously discussed. The lower than normal tax rates in 3Q '05 and 4Q `04 reflect benefits of $105MM and $12MM, respectively, from the resolution of previous years' tax audits and return items. -4-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FOURTH QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED o DISCOUNT REVENUE: A 15% increase in billed business, partially offset by a lower average discount rate, yielded a 13% increase in discount revenue. - - The average discount rate* was 2.54% in 4Q `05 versus 2.57% in 3Q `05 and 2.58% in 4Q `04. The decrease versus last year and last quarter continues to reflect, in part, ongoing changes in the mix of spending between various merchant segments in addition to seasonally higher fourth quarter retail spend levels. The decrease also reflects costs associated with investments in strategic merchant partnerships. - -- We believe the AXP value proposition is strong. However, as indicated in prior quarters, continued changes in the mix of business, volume-related pricing discounts and selective repricing initiatives will likely continue to result in some erosion of the average discount rate over time. * For additional information about billed business and discount rate calculations, please refer to the Fourth Quarter/Full Year 2005 Earnings Release, American Express Company Selected Statistical Information pages. ** Proprietary card activity only. - - WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS: The 15% increase in worldwide billed business reflected a 16% increase in USCS, a 10% increase in ICGCS and a 34% increase in Global Network Services ("GNS") partner volume. Worldwide average spend per proprietary basic card grew by 7% and total cards in force grew by 9%. -- U.S. billed business was up 15% reflecting growth of 15% within our consumer card business, an 18% increase in small business spending and a 13% improvement in Corporate Services volumes. - Spending per proprietary basic card in force increased 8%. - U.S. non-T&E-related volume categories (which represented approximately 71% of 4Q `05 U.S. billed business) grew 17%, while T&E volumes rose 12%. - U.S. airline-related volume, which represented approximately 10% of total U.S. volumes during the quarter, rose 12% due to 8% transaction volume growth and an approximately 3% higher average airline charge. - -- Excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation: - Worldwide-billed business and spending per proprietary basic card in force increased 16% and 9%, respectively. - Total billed business outside the U.S. rose 13% reflecting double-digit proprietary growth in all regions, with the largest increases in Canada and Latin America. - Within our proprietary business, billed business outside the U.S. reflected 14% growth in consumer and small business spending, as well as in Corporate Services volumes. - Spending per proprietary basic card in force outside the U.S. rose 9%. - Worldwide airline volumes, which represented approximately 11% of total volumes during the quarter, increased 15% on 10% growth in transaction volume, and a 4% increase in the average airline charge. - - CARDS IN FORCE: Rose 9% worldwide due to an increase of 7% in USCS, 5% in ICGCS and 23% in GNS. Continued robust card acquisitions within both the proprietary and GNS activities, as well as strong average customer retention levels, drove this change. - 1MM cards were added during the quarter in both the U.S. and the non-U.S. businesses, respectively. GNS growth was achieved despite the addition of a substantial number of cards last year through the MBNA partnership. -5-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FOURTH QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED o CARDMEMBER LENDING NET FINANCE CHARGE REVENUE: Increased 25% on 19% growth in average worldwide lending balances on an owned basis and a higher portfolio yield. - Annualized net finance charge revenue as a percentage of average loans in the worldwide owned portfolio was 9.0% in 4Q `05 versus 9.2% in 3Q '05 and 8.6% in 4Q `04. The increase versus last year reflects a lower proportion of the U.S. portfolio on introductory rates and increased finance charge rates, partially offset by rising funding costs. o NET CARD FEES: Grew 5% primarily due to higher cards in force. In 4Q '05, 3Q '05 and 4Q '04 the average annual fee per proprietary card in force was $35. o TRAVEL COMMISSIONS AND FEES: Declined 10% due to a 3% decline in travel sales and lower transaction fees, due in part to the ongoing transition to online booking. o OTHER COMMISSIONS AND FEES: Increased 4% on higher card-related assessments. o SECURITIZATION INCOME, NET: Decreased 9% as a greater average balance of securitized loans and a higher portfolio yield were more than offset by an increase in portfolio write-offs, reflecting the 4Q'05 bankruptcy legislation effect. Securitization income, net represents the non-credit provision components of the net gains and charges from securitization activities within the USCS segment, the amortization and related impairment charges, if any, of the related interest-only strip, excess spread related to securitized loans, net finance charge revenue on retained interests in securitized loans, and servicing income, net of related discounts or fees. - During 4Q '05, results reflected net securitization gains, including the credit components, of $11MM ($7MM after-tax). During 4Q '04, there was no incremental securitization activity. The average balance of Cardmember lending securitizations was $21.0B in 4Q '05, compared with $20.3B in 4Q '04. o OTHER INVESTMENT AND INTEREST INCOME: Increased 7% largely due to higher interest rates on a greater level of short-term investments. o OTHER REVENUES: Increased 13% primarily due to fees associated with transition services agreements with Ameriprise Financial, Inc. o HUMAN RESOURCES EXPENSE: Declined 4% due to $52MM of lower severance costs and the realization of reengineering benefits, partially offset by higher management incentives, including additional incremental stock-based compensation expenses, merit increases and larger benefit costs. o MARKETING, PROMOTION, REWARDS AND CARDMEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES: Increased 11%, reflecting greater rewards costs and higher marketing and promotion expenses. The increase in marketing and promotion expenses is due to the Company's ongoing global brand advertising campaign and our continued focus on business-building initiatives. The growth in rewards costs is attributable to volume growth, a higher redemption rate and strong cardmember loyalty program participation. o PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES AND BENEFITS: Increased 34% as the charge card and lending provisions rose 21% and 40%, respectively, and other provisions increased by 52%. The charge and lending growth reflects higher provision rates reflecting the impact of the new bankruptcy legislation and strong volume increases within both activities. The other provision rose due to higher interest rates on larger investment certificate balances. - Credit Quality: -- Overall credit quality continued to perform well, excluding the bankruptcy reform legislation impact which increased write-offs substantially. -- Reserve coverage ratios, which are in excess of 100% of past due balances, remained strong. - WORLDWIDE CHARGE CARD:* - -- The loss ratio increased versus last quarter and last year. Past due rates improved versus last year and last quarter. -6-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FOURTH QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED - - WORLDWIDE LENDING:** -- The write-off rate rose versus last year and last quarter. Past due levels were flat with last quarter, but up from last year. * There are no off-balance sheet Charge Card securitizations. Therefore, "Owned basis" and "Managed basis" credit quality statistics for the Charge Card portfolio are the same. ** All lending statistics are presented here on a GAAP or "Owned Basis". "Managed Basis" credit quality statistics are available in the Fourth Quarter/Full Year 2005 Earnings Release on the Consolidated Selected Statistical Information pages. Credit trends are generally consistent under both reporting methods. o PROFESSIONAL SERVICES EXPENSE: Rose 10% reflecting increased technology costs related to higher business and service-related volumes. o OCCUPANCY AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSE: Rose 3% due in part to the amortization of software costs and partially offset by savings from the consolidation of certain facilities. o INTEREST EXPENSE: Rose 12% due to higher receivable balances and a higher effective cost of funds. o COMMUNICATIONS EXPENSE: Decreased 5% versus last year due to reengineering-related saves partially offset by increased volumes. o OTHER OPERATING EXPENSE: Increased 24% due to the 4Q '04 $117MM net gain on the sale of the equipment leasing product line within the small business financing unit. -7-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FOURTH QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - PRO FORMA ROE The Company's consolidated return on equity (ROE) is calculated on a trailing 12-month basis using reported net income over average total shareholder's equity (including discontinued operations). The Company also reports pro forma ROE, which is determined using trailing four quarters income from continuing operations (which excludes discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting changes) over average month-end shareholders' equity for the quarter ended December 31, 2005. Management believes pro forma ROE is an important measure because it reflects performance of the Company's continuing businesses by excluding the impact of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. and American Express Tax and Business Services, Inc., which were disposed of as of September 30, 2005. *** MANAGED BASIS USCS and ICGCS segment results are presented on a managed basis and GNMS and Corporate & Other segment results are presented on a GAAP basis. For USCS, managed basis means the presentation assumes there have been no securitization transactions, i.e. all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the Company's balance sheet and income statements, respectively. The Company presents USCS information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Asset securitization is just one of several ways for the Company to fund cardmember loans. Use of a managed basis presentation, including non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans, presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business, avoiding distortions due to the mix of funding sources at any particular point in time. The Company does not currently securitize international loans. Irrespective of the funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics, such as changes in delinquencies and write-off rates, for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant metrics in evaluating the Company's performance and can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The managed basis presentation for USCS also reflects an increase to interest income recorded to evaluate tax-exempt investments on a basis consistent with taxable investment securities. On a GAAP basis, interest income associated with tax-exempt investments is recorded based on amounts earned. Accordingly, information presented on a managed basis assumes that tax-exempt securities earned income at rates as if the securities produced taxable income with a corresponding increase in the provision for income taxes. The managed basis presentation for ICGCS reflects a foreign exchange services reclassification of revenue earned related to the sale and purchase of foreign currencies as part of the foreign exchange business. On a GAAP basis, these revenues are included with other foreign exchange items that are reflected in other operating expenses. Accordingly, information presented on a managed basis assumes that the amounts earned are included in other revenue with a corresponding increase in other operating expenses. -8-

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FOURTH QUARTER 2005 OVERVIEW U.S. CARD SERVICES The following table compares and reconciles the GAAP basis USCS income statements to the managed basis information, where different. Management views any net gains from securitizations as discretionary benefits to be used for card acquisition expenses, which are reflected in both marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services and other operating expenses. Consequently, the managed basis presentation assumes the impact of this net activity was offset by higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses of $6MM in 4Q '05, and other operating expenses of $5MM in 4Q '05. Accordingly, the incremental expenses, as well as the impact of the net lending securitization activity, are eliminated. -10-

Expense growth reflected higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services costs, greater provision for losses, higher human resources expenses, larger professional services expenses, greater interest expense, and larger occupancy and equipment costs, partially offset by lower other expenses and lower communication costs. Translation of foreign currency expenses contributed less than 1% to the 10% consolidated expense growth rate. o PRE-TAX MARGIN: Was 17.5% in 2005 and 2004. o EFFECTIVE TAX RATE: Was 24% in 2005 compared to 30% in 2004.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FULL YEAR 2005 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED o DISCOUNT REVENUE: A 16% increase in billed business, partially offset by a lower average discount rate, yielded a 14% increase in discount revenue. - The average discount rate* was 2.57% in 2005 versus 2.60% in 2004. The decrease versus last year continues to reflect, in part, changes in the mix of spending between various merchant segments. * For additional information about billed business and discount rate calculations, please refer to the Fourth Quarter/Full Year 2005 Earnings Release, American Express Company Selected Statistical Information pages. **Proprietary card activity only. - - WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS: The 16% increase in worldwide billed business reflected a 16% increase in USCS, a 13% increase in ICGCS and a 36% increase in GNS partner volume. Worldwide average spend per proprietary basic card grew by 10% and total cards in force grew by 9%. -- U.S. billed business was up 16% reflecting growth of 15% within our consumer card business, a 20% increase in small business spending and a 11% improvement in Corporate Services volumes. - Spending per proprietary basic card in force increased 9%. - U.S. non-T&E-related volume categories (which represented approximately 67% of 2005 U.S. billed business) grew 18%, while T&E volumes rose 11%. - U.S. airline-related volume, which represented approximately 12% of total U.S. volumes during the year, rose 9% as 13% transaction volume growth was suppressed by an approximately 4% lower average airline charge. -- Excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation: - Worldwide billed business and spending per proprietary basic card in force increased 16% and 10%, respectively. - Total billed business outside the U.S. rose 13%, reflecting double-digit proprietary growth in all regions, with the largest increases in Canada and Latin America. - Within our proprietary business, billed business outside the U.S. reflected 13% growth in consumer and small business spending, as well as a 14% increase in Corporate Services volumes. - Spending per proprietary basic card in force outside the U.S. rose 14%. - Worldwide airline volumes, which represented approximately 12% of total volumes during the year, increased 13% on 14% growth in transaction volume and a lower average airline charge. o CARDMEMBER LENDING NET FINANCE CHARGE REVENUE: Increased 16% on 10% growth in average worldwide lending balances on an owned basis and a higher portfolio yield. - Annualized net finance charge revenue as a percentage of average loans in the worldwide portfolio was 9.1% in 2005 versus 8.6% in 2004. The increase versus last year reflects a lower proportion of the U.S. portfolio on introductory rates and increased finance charge rates, partially offset by rising funding costs. -18-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FULL YEAR 2005 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED o NET CARD FEES: Grew 7% due to higher cards in force and a greater average fee. In 2005, the average annual fee per proprietary card in force was $35 versus $34 in 2004. o TRAVEL COMMISSIONS AND FEES: Declined 1% as higher travel sales were partially offset by lower transaction fees as a greater proportion of bookings were made on-line. o OTHER COMMISSIONS AND FEES: Increased 7% on higher card-related assessments. o SECURITIZATION INCOME, NET: Increased 11% on a greater average balance of securitized loans, a higher portfolio yield and a decrease in portfolio write-offs, partially offset by greater interest expense due to a higher coupon rate paid to certificate holders and an increase in the payment speed of the trust assets. Securitization income, net represents the non-credit provision components of the net gains and charges from securitization activities within the USCS segment, the amortization and related impairment charges, if any, of the related interest-only strip, excess spread related to securitized loans, net finance charge revenue on retained interests in securitized loans, and servicing income, net of related discounts or fees. - During 2005 and 2004, results reflected net securitization gains, including the credit components, of $21MM ($14MM after-tax) and $26MM ($17MM after-tax), respectively. The average balance of Cardmember lending securitizations was $20.6B in 2005 compared with $19.4B in 2004. o OTHER INVESTMENT AND INTEREST INCOME: Increased 6% largely due to higher interest rates on a greater level of short-term investments. o OTHER REVENUES: Were flat for the year, with increases due to fees associated with transition services agreements with Ameriprise Financial, Inc. and higher publishing revenues offset by lower ATM revenues resulting from the sale of the business in 3Q '04. o HUMAN RESOURCES EXPENSE: Increased 6% due to $203MM of severance costs in 2005 versus $76MM in 2004, higher management incentives, including an additional year of incremental stock-based compensation expenses, merit increases and increased employee benefit costs which were partially offset by reengineering benefits. o MARKETING, PROMOTION, REWARDS AND CARDMEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES: Increased 18%, reflecting higher marketing and promotion expenses and greater rewards costs. The increase in marketing and promotion expenses is due to the Company's ongoing global brand advertising campaign and our continued focus on business-building initiatives. The growth in rewards costs is attributable to volume growth, a higher redemption rate and strong cardmember loyalty program participation. o PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES AND BENEFITS: Increased 22% as the charge card and lending provisions rose 25% and 19%, respectively, and the other provisions grew by 28%. The charge and lending growth reflects strong volume increases within both activities and higher provision rates, mostly due to substantially higher write-offs during 4Q `05 within the lending business due to the October 17, 2005 change in bankruptcy legislation, as well as a $49MM provision in 3Q '05 due to estimated costs related to Hurricane Katrina. The increase in the other provision reflects higher interest rates on larger investment certificate balances in addition to a $115MM charge in 3Q '04 resulting from the reconciliation of prior year's securitization-related lending receivables accounts and a $60MM benefit in 3Q '04 reflecting a reduction in merchant-related reserves. - - CREDIT QUALITY: -- The charge card net loss ratio remained unchanged versus last year at 0.26%.* -- The lending net write-off rate for 2005 was 4.1% versus 4.0% for 2004.** * There are no off-balance sheet charge card securitizations. Therefore, "Owned basis" and "Managed Basis" credit quality statistics for the charge card portfolio are the same. ** All lending statistics are presented here on a GAAP or "Owned Basis". "Managed Basis" credit quality statistics are available in the Fourth Quarter/Full Year 2005 Earnings Release on the Consolidated Selected Statistical Information pages. Credit trends are generally consistent under both reporting methods. o PROFESSIONAL SERVICES EXPENSE: Rose 8% reflecting increased technology costs related to higher business and service-related volumes. o OCCUPANCY AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSE: Rose 6% primarily due to higher rent expense and the amortization of software costs. o INTEREST EXPENSE: Rose 13% due to higher receivable balances and a higher effective cost of funds. o COMMUNICATIONS EXPENSE: Decreased 4% versus last year due to increased volumes more than offset by reengineering-related savings. o OTHER OPERATING EXPENSE: Decreased 8% due to the inclusion last year of a $117MM net gain from the sale of the equipment leasing product line and lower expenses as a result of our 3Q '04 sale of the ATM business. -19-

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FULL YEAR 2005 OVERVIEW U.S. CARD SERVICES The following table compares and reconciles the GAAP basis USCS income statements to the managed basis information, where different. Management views any net gains from securitizations as discretionary benefits to be used for card acquisition expenses, which are reflected in both marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services and other operating expenses. Consequently, the managed basis presentation assumes the impact of this net activity was offset by higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses of $13MM in 2005 and $16MM in 2004, and other operating expenses of $8MM in 2005 and $10MM in 2004. Accordingly, the incremental expenses, as well as the impact of the net lending securitization activity, are eliminated. -21-
