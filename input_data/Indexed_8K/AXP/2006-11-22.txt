Item 5.02  Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
                On November 20, 2006, the Compensation and Benefits Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of American Express Company (the "Company") approved the Company's 2007 Pay-for-Performance Deferral Program (the "2007 Deferral Program"). A brief summary of the terms and conditions of the 2007 Deferral Program is set forth below and a copy of the 2007 Pay-for-Performance Deferral Program Document is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report and is hereby incorporated by reference.
(e)
                              
The 2007 Deferral Program permits eligible senior-level employees subject to U.S. income taxes to defer payment of their 2007 base salary, cash bonus related to the 2007 performance year (to be paid in or about February 2008) or any eventual payout under the Portfolio Grant-XVII Award (payable in or about February 2009) under the Company's 1998 Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended; , , that the maximum total amount that a participant may defer into his or her deferral account from all sources under the 2007 Deferral Program is one times base salary as of December 31, 2006.  The program annually credits interest equivalents to deferred balances according to a schedule based on the reported annual return on equity ("ROE") of the Company for the relevant year as compared to the Company's publicly-announced long-term ROE target (currently 33% - 36%, on average and over time) and certain vesting requirements.  Under the 2007 Deferral Program, if the Company's annual ROE for a given year is less than the low end of the Company's ROE target range (i.e., currently 33%), then the balance maintained in a participant's 2007 deferral account will be credited with an interest equivalent based on the average corporate bond rate for the relevant year as announced by Moody's Investors Service for borrowers rated "A" (the "Moody's A Rate").  If the Company's annual ROE for a given year is within the Company's ROE target range (i.e., currently 33% - - 36%), then the balance maintained in a participant's 2007 deferral account will be credited with an interest equivalent at the rate of 9%.  If the Company's annual ROE for a given year is greater than the high end of the Company's ROE target range (i.e., currently 36%), then the balance maintained in a participant's 2007 deferral account will be credited with an interest equivalent at the rate of 11%.  The Committee may adjust, prospectively or retroactively, in its sole discretion without a participant's prior consent or notice, the rates at which interest equivalents are credited.
provided
however
If a participant elects to defer any compensation under the 2007 Deferral Program, he or she must defer such compensation for at least five years. In the event a participant's employment by the Company or any of its subsidiaries terminates prior to the end of the minimum five-year deferral period for any reason other than retirement, disability or death, then the participant's 2007 deferral account would be paid with interest equivalents credited for the entire period of deferral at the lesser of (i) the amount initially deferred under the 2007 Deferral Program credited annually at the crediting rate then in effect based on the Company's ROE as
2
described above or (ii) the initial deferred amount credited annually at the Moody's A Rate.  In the event a participant's employment by the Company or any of its subsidiaries terminates on or after the end of the minimum five-year deferral period or as a result of retirement, disability or death, then the participant's 2007 deferral account would be paid with interest equivalents credited annually using the ROE schedule rate described above.
The 2007 Deferral Program permits participants to specify to have their 2007 deferral account paid (or otherwise begin payments, if installments are elected) (i) on a specified date that is no earlier than the end of the minimum five-year deferral period, (ii) upon retirement or (iii) upon a specified date up to ten years following retirement. In addition, participants may specify to have their 2007 deferral account paid in a lump sum or in two to 15 annual installments. Regardless of a participant's specified time and form of payment, in the event that the participant's employment by the Company or any of its subsidiaries terminates for any reason other than retirement or disability, then the participant's 2007 deferral account would be paid out in a lump sum on the first day of the first month that is at least six months following the termination of employment or as soon as practicable thereafter. The Committee may delay payment to a participant under the 2007 Deferral Program until such payment is fully deductible under Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  In addition, payment of a participant's deferral account may be accelerated upon a change in control of the Company.

Exhibit 10.1
2007 Pay-for-Performance Deferral Program Document
This is the official governing plan document for the 2007-Pay-for-Performance Deferral Program.  To the extent that the terms of any summary program description, guide or brief conflict with the terms of this document, the terms of this document shall control.
 
These are the basic guidelines of the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors of American Express Company (the "Committee") concerning requests for deferred payment of:
any cash award related to the 2007 performance year (a "2007 Annual Incentive Award") otherwise payable on or about February 2008, under the American Express Annual Incentive Award Plan or any successor plan or plans (an "Incentive Plan");(a)
                 
                 
2007 base salary otherwise payable in 2007 under the AXP Salary Deferral Plan or any successor plan or plans (a "Deferral Plan"); and
                 
any eventual payout under the Portfolio Grant-XVII Award granted on or about 2006 and otherwise payable on or about February 2009 ("PG-XVII Award") under the American Express Company 1998 Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended and restated (the "1998 Plan").(b)
A deferral of your 2007 Annual Incentive Award, 2007 base salary and/or PG-XVII Award is part of the 2007 Pay-for-Performance Deferral Program (the "2007 Program").
Eligible employees will be notified about the 2007 Program.  Generally, you are eligible if you are an "active" (as defined below) senior level employee (band 50 or above) who participates in the applicable Incentive Plan and:  (i) is subject to U.S. income taxes; or (ii) is designated by the Company as an eligible U.S. Dollar-Paid Expatriate who is a U.S. Citizen or U.S. Greencard holder.  If you are an eligible employee and the Company offers you the opportunity to participate in the 2007 Program, then you may request deferred payment of a 2007 Annual Incentive Award, 2007 base salary and/or PG-XVII Award subject to the provisions of this document, the applicable Incentive Plan, the applicable Deferral Plan and the 1998 Plan.
(a)
         
The Committee may include other incentive programs or awards in its sole discretion.  References in this document to "2007 Annual Incentive Award" and "Incentive Plan" shall include such other incentive arrangements determined by the Committee.
The Committee may include other Performance Grants in its sole discretion.  References in this document to "PG-XVII" shall include such other Performance Grants determined by the Committee.
(b)
        
You must be an "active" employee (i.e., providing services to the Company or an approved subsidiary) on December 31, 2006 and during the remainder of 2007 to participate in the 2007 Program.  Employees who become newly eligible during 2007 and are offered the opportunity to participate in the 2007 Program by the Company may request deferred payment of their post-election 2007 base salary and the post-election portion of their 2007 Annual Incentive Award if they have not previously participated in an account-balance deferred compensation arrangement of the Company (as defined for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code) and they make their request to defer no later than 30 days after their first day of eligibility (e.g., date of employment for new hires).  If your employee status changes to "inactive" during the year for any reason, including, but not limited to, severance, or if your employment terminates (for any reason, including, but not limited to, retirement, disability or death), all deferral elections will become immediately void except for any amounts already deferred prior to such change in status.
If you elect to defer a portion of your base salary and your employee status changes to "inactive" (as described above) during the year, your bi-weekly base salary deductions will be discontinued and previous deductions will be credited to your account.  In the case of a leave of absence, the bi-weekly base salary deductions in effect prior to the leave will resume when you return from leave to "active" status.  Your initial deferral amount for the purposes of the 2007 Program, therefore, will be reduced.
Modification or Termination of 2007 Program
Any terms and features of, and benefits and rights under, the 2007 Program and your deferral election may be interpreted, modified or terminated by the Committee in its sole discretion in any manner and at any time without your prior consent or notice (including, but not limited to, alignment with legislative and regulatory developments) provided that such interpretation, modification or termination shall not cause deferred amounts to fail to meet the requirement for favorable tax treatment pursuant to the Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, applicable regulations thereunder, and other IRS guidance ("Section 409A").
Despite the guidance issued to date, several issues under Section 409A remain unclear and future guidance is expected.  Accordingly, any terms and features of, and rights and benefits under, the 2007 Program and your deferral election may be interpreted, modified or terminated by the Committee in its sole discretion in any manner and at any time without your prior consent or notice (including, but not limited to, deferring the payment date) in an effort to cause deferred amounts to meet the requirements for favorable tax treatment pursuant to the Section 409A.
The ROE Schedule Rate applied to your deferred balance may be changed, prospectively or retroactively, in the sole discretion of the Committee without your prior consent or notice.  In addition, the ROE Target Range applicable under the ROE Rate Schedule is subject to adjustment by the Company.
Administrative Changes for 2007
Under transition guidance on the application of Section 409A, the Company is providing the opportunity to defer PG-XVII Awards (payable in February 2009) at this time under the 2007 Program.  While this is election is one year earlier than our usual practice, certain features of PG-XVII preclude deferral elections after December 31, 2006.
                 
The Company is continuing the online enrollment process for deferral elections under the 2007 Program.  In addition, the Company is allowing employees (other than employees who reside in community property states) to make on-line beneficiary designations during the online enrollment period.  Employees who reside in community property states will be required to manually submit paper forms because such states require spousal consent.
                 
Your request for deferral and is irrevocable as of 11:59 PM EST on December 31, 2006.    However, employees who become newly eligible during 2007 may request deferred payment of their post-election 2007 base salary and the post-election portion of their 2007 Annual Incentive Award if they make their request to defer no later than 30 days after their first day of eligibility (e.g., date of employment for a new hire).
must be received on or before Sunday, December 31, 2006
If your request for deferral form is not received by this date, the deferral election will not be effective.
You can request to defer from one or more of the following sources provided you defer a minimum of $5,000 from each source you select:
                 
any 2007 Annual Incentive Award that would otherwise be payable for 2007 performance (e.g., otherwise payable on or about February 2008);
                 
2007 base salary; and/or
PG-XVII Award otherwise payable on or about February 2009.
                 
The combined amounts that you elect to defer from your 2007 Annual Incentive Award, 2007 base salary and/or PG-XVII Award is your "Initial Deferred Amount."  Your Initial Deferred Amount is 100% of your annual base salary as of the later of or the date that you become eligible to participate.  However, the maximum total amount which employees who become newly eligible may elect to defer from their 2007 base salary is 100% of their post-election 2007 base salary.
maximum
December 31, 2006
Important additional details on the "Initial Deferred Amount" are shown on page 14 of this document.
You may request that payment(s) be deferred until one of the following (see also the section on "Payout Provisions" on pages 9 to 11 of this document):
a specific date, at least five years from date of deferral (i.e., February 1, 2013 for 2007 Annual Incentive Award and 2007 base salary deferrals; February 1, 2014 for PG-XVII deferrals) or later;
                 
or
your retirement (as defined below);
                 
or
a specified date after your retirement (but not later than 10 years after retirement).
                 
Your payment request is subject to the conditions described in this document.
"Retirement" means the date your employment terminates following your attainment of age 55 and 10 actual or deemed years of service with American Express Company or its affiliates.  You will be considered to have terminated your employment as of your actual date of separation, and the Company will commence distribution of your 2007 deferrals using such date (subject to a six-month delay).
Pursuant to the Section 409A, payments to certain employees following retirement or termination must be delayed by six months.  Given the difficulty in identifying affected participants, and to ensure compliance with this requirement and to protect participants from possible penalties under the Section 409A, the Company will delay payments following retirement or termination to all participants by six months.    (See "Payout Provisions" on pages 9 to 11 of this document.)
Therefore, regardless of your election or as otherwise stated in this document, payments to all participants following retirement or termination will be delayed by six months.
A bookkeeping account will be established and maintained (for purposes of this document the "Deferral Bookkeeping Account") in your name and will initially be credited with your Initial Deferred Amount as of the applicable date (i.e., when amount would otherwise have been paid).  "Interest" equivalents will be credited on the Initial Deferred Amount and thereafter on the balance of the Deferred Bookkeeping Account, as adjusted annually.
The deferred balance is credited with "interest" equivalents based on a schedule established by the Committee (the "ROE Schedule Rate"), which is based on the Company's annual return on equity ("ROE"), as reported, subject to adjustment for major accounting changes as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion (see schedule on following page). 
The ROE Schedule Rate applied to your deferred balance may be changed, prospectively or retroactively, in the sole discretion of the Committee without your prior consent or notice.
 
"ROE" means American Express Company's consolidated annual Return on Equity as reported by the Company, subject to adjustment for significant accounting changes as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.
"ROE Target Range" for a given year means the announced ROE target range of the Company in effect on December 31 of such year. 
The ROE Schedule Rate applied to your deferred balance may be changed, prospectively or retroactively, in the sole discretion of the Committee without your prior consent or notice.
"Moody's A Corporate Bond Yield Rate" for a given year means the average corporate bond rate for the relevant year as announced by Moody's Investor Services for borrowers rated "A."
Example
The Company announced an ROE target range of 33% to 36% in November of 2006.  Assuming such ROE target range remains in effect through December 31, 2008, then a participant's 2007 deferred amounts would be credited with interest equivalents for 2008 as follows:
 
You may request that the payment of the amount credited to your Deferral Bookkeeping Account begin:
on the first day of a specific month and year, at least five years from date of deferral (i.e., February 1, 2013 for 2007 Annual Incentive Award and 2007 base salary deferrals; February 1, 2014 for PG-XVII deferrals) or later;
                 
or
upon your retirement;
                 
or
on the first day of a specific month and year after retirement (but no later than 10 years after retirement).
                 
Payments may be made in a lump sum or in 2 to 15 approximately equal annual installments.  Commencement of payment is subject to a six-month delay.
interest equivalents for the year in which payment occurs will be credited through the payment date using the ROE Schedule Rate for the prior year.  the balance remaining after each installment payment will continue to be credited with interest equivalents based on the ROE Schedule Rate in effect under the Program for that year, or as otherwise determined by the Committee.  (In the latter case, references in this document to "ROE Schedule Rate" and related value calculations would refer to such other rate or calculation as determined by the Committee.)
If you choose a lump sum payment,
If you choose annual installments,
Generally, each annual installment payment is calculated using an "annuity due" formula, which assumes, for calculation purposes, that the applicable ROE Schedule Rate remains constant for the remainder of the elected payment schedule.  Your annual payments could vary from year to year if the actual ROE Schedule Rate differs from the assumed rate. The first installment payment will be made on the first day of the first month that is at least six-months following the elected payment date or event, or as administratively feasible thereafter, and the interest equivalents for that year will be credited through the payment date using the ROE Schedule Rate for the prior year.  Thus, the crediting rate applied for a payment with a date of December 1 will reflect the ROE Schedule Rate of the year beginning 23 months earlier, and the crediting rate applied for a payment with a date of January 1 will reflect the ROE Schedule Rate of the year beginning 12 months earlier.  The remaining installment payments will be made on or about March 31st of each year thereafter with each payment credited using the ROE Schedule Rate for the prior year.
Retirement or Disability
If your employment by American Express Company and its affiliates terminates at any time by reason of "retirement" (as defined above) or by reason of "disability" (as defined for purposes of Section 409A), the amount credited to your Deferral Bookkeeping Account will be paid out based upon the time and in the manner you have elected (but not later than 10 years following retirement, and subject to a six-month delay), with interest equivalents credited as described above.
Death
If you die before payment begins or installment payments are completed, your designated beneficiary (see Beneficiary Designation Form in the Appendix) or the legal representatives of your estate (if you do not designate a beneficiary or if your designated beneficiary does not survive you) will receive a lump sum as soon as practicable after your death, of the balance of your Deferral Bookkeeping Account, with interest equivalents for the year of death credited using the ROE Schedule Rate for the prior year.
Other Termination
If your employment by American Express Company and its affiliates terminates for any reason other than retirement, disability or death, your Deferral Bookkeeping Account will be paid out in a lump sum as soon as practicable after termination of employment (subject to a six-month delay) with interest equivalents credited for the entire period of deferral as described below:
for terminations prior to the end of the minimum five-year deferral period, the lesser of:  (i) the Initial Deferred Amount credited annually at the ROE Schedule Rate; or (ii) the Initial Deferred Amount credited annually with the rate of return on the applicable Moody's A Corporate Bond Rate, with credits through your termination date (for information on the deferral period, see page 6 of this document); or
                 
for terminations on or after the minimum five-year deferral period, the Initial Deferred Amount credited annually using the ROE Schedule Rate, with credits through your termination date.
                 
Change in Control
Regardless of the payout method you choose, payment of your Deferral Bookkeeping Account may be accelerated upon a "Change in Control" of American Express Company.  Generally, subject to governing documents, a "Change in Control" includes the acquisition of beneficial ownership by certain persons of 25% or more of the Company's common shares or all outstanding voting securities of the Company, the current Board members of the Company cease to constitute a majority thereof or certain reorganizations, mergers, consolidations, liquidations or sales of all or substantially all of the Company's assets.  The timing of the payout, and the definition of a "Change in Control" are governed by the provisions of the applicable annual and long-term incentive plans, Appendix B and Committee actions. Refer to these documents for additional information.  To the extent required by Section 409A, payment shall only be accelerated if the "Change of Control" event constitutes a change in the ownership of the Company, a change in the effective control of the Company, or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company, each as defined for purposes of Section 409A.
Certain Other Limitations
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at the time that payment would otherwise be made to you under the Program, (i) you are an executive officer (within the meaning of Rule 3b-7 (or any successor rule) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, of the Company (an "Executive Officer"), or (ii) payment would be subject to the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or any successor provision), such that your employer would lose some or all of the federal income tax deduction for such payment, then such payment to you shall be further deferred (unless otherwise determined by the Committee in its sole discretion) until the first taxable year in which (x) you are no longer an Executive Officer and (y) you are no longer subject to the limitations in clause (ii) above, with appropriate interest equivalents being credited to your Deferral Bookkeeping Account under the Program during the additional period of deferral.
You are strongly urged to consult with your own personal financial, legal and tax advisors on these and any other tax consequences.
As previously mentioned,Congress passed legislation the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "AJCA"), which enacted Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code ("Section 409A").  Section 409Agenerally became effective in 2005 and made significant changes to the area of nonqualified deferred compensation.  Section 409A principally affects standards for deferral elections and distributions.  Failure to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A will result in the imposition of taxes, back interest, and an additional 20% penalty.  In addition, the Company is now required to annually report deferred amounts on a participant's W-2 or 1099 for the year deferred, .
Recent Federal Administrative Guidance:
 
even if not currently includable in income for federal tax purposes
In order to comply with the new rules, the Committee may, in its sole discretion in any manner and at any time without your prior consent or notice, decide to administer, operate, or amend the Program in conformity with Section 409A in an effort to maintain the effectiveness of deferral elections.  See the section "Modification or Termination of 2007 Program" on page 4 of this document.
If under Section 409A or future legislative or administrative guidance your deferral elections are deemed to be ineffective or if the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") otherwise does not give effect to your deferral election, either when made, or at a later date, this may result in the Initial Deferred Amount being included in your income in the year it is otherwise payable, and the inclusion of interest equivalents in your income in the year such interest equivalents are credited.  These income amounts would be subject to current tax and tax withholding and you would also have to pay interest on any underpayment of tax together with an additional 20% penalty on compensation which is required to be included in income.
For U.S. Social Security (FICA) tax purposes, your Initial Deferred Amount will be subject to FICA tax in the year that your 2007 Annual Incentive Award, 2007 base salary and/or PG-XVII Award would otherwise be payable, as if the deferral had not taken place.  Thus, you will be subject to FICA tax on the Initial Deferral Amounts.  As background, FICA tax consists of two components:  (i) old-age, survivors and disability insurance tax assessed at 6.2% on compensation up to $97,500 for 2007; and (ii) Medicare tax assessed at a rate of 1.45% on all applicable compensation.  You should leave enough "net pay" in one or more of:  your 2007 Annual Incentive Award; 2007 base salary and/or PG-XVII Award, to cover the total FICA tax amounts that will be taken at the time of deferral as well as all other pre- and post-tax deductions.
In addition, "premium interest" earned on deferred compensation balances will be subject to FICA tax when vested.  "Premium interest" consists of the excess of a program's annual ROE Schedule Rate over a benchmark rate.  The highest rate approved by the IRS at this time is the Moody's Average Corporate Bond Yield, which the Company will use to calculate premium interest subject to FICA.  Therefore, for example, if the ROE Schedule Rate for 2007 were 11% and the Moody's rate for that year were 6%, the 5% premium interest credited would be subject to FICA when vested.
Under the 2007 Program, interest equivalents vest when the five-year employment/deferral period is completed for each deferral amount you elect or when you become "retirement" eligible (definition under the Program of at least 55 years of age with at least 10 years of service).  As each five-year employment/deferral period following a deferral election is completed, the credited interest equivalents applicable to that election vest and the premium portion then becomes subject to FICA, to be withheld in March of the vesting year (e.g., premium interest equivalents credited under the 2007 Program for a 2007 Annual Incentive Award deferral will become subject to FICA tax withholding in March of 2013).  However, in the year you become retirement eligible, all unvested interest equivalents for all deferral elections vest, and the premium portion then becomes subject to FICA tax, to be withheld in March of the following year (e.g., if an employee becomes retirement eligible in 2008, the premium interest equivalents credited under the 2007 Program will become subject to FICA tax withholding in March of 2009).
The two foregoing sections are not intended and should not be construed as tax advice.  You are strongly urged to review all aspects of a possible deferral with your own tax advisor, including all U.S. federal, state or local and foreign tax consequences, in light of your individual circumstances.  If you are working outside the U.S. and/or are subject to foreign tax laws, it is particularly important that you review a possible deferral with your tax advisor.
A request for deferred payment of your 2007 Annual Incentive Award, 2007 base salary and/or PG-XVII Award is irrevocable.  You may not ask for different terms.  An exception to this rule is possible, subject to the provisions of this document and applicable Deferral Document, only if the occurrence of an "unforeseeable emergency" (as defined for purposes of Section 409A) is demonstrated to, and approved by, the Committee.  Any withdrawal can never be returned to your Deferral Bookkeeping Account and will be subject to U.S. income tax and other taxes in the year it is received by you, as described in more detail above.  Under these standards, hardship withdrawals will only be allowed under rare and unusual circumstances and should not be relied upon for financial planning purposes.
Since the request to defer payment of your 2007 Annual Incentive Award, 2007 base salary and/or PG-XVII Award, once approved, is irrevocable, the decision to do so requires careful personal financial planning.  Please review your planned deferral with your personal financial, legal and tax planning advisors to making such a request.  Among the considerations may be:  the impact on your participation in U.S. benefit plans (see pages 15 to 16 of this document); your cashflow needs; and planning for stock option exercises or stock purchases (e.g., to achieve your stock ownership guideline level, if you have been notified of participation in that program).
carefully
prior
The Program is unfunded and all payments are made out of the general assets of your employer.  Your employer is not required to establish any special or separate fund or to make any other segregation of assets to assure the payment of any amount under the Program.  Payments under the Program are neither subordinate nor superior to the claims of your employer's general creditors.  Amounts deferred under the Program may be used for any corporate purpose by your employer; you and anyone claiming under or through you will, of course, have no interest in any such corporate assets or in any proceeds therefrom.
As a condition to your deferral of your 2007 Annual Incentive Award, 2007 base salary and/or PG-XVII Award, it is understood and agreed that you will provide complete and valid information, signatures and consents on all documents, and you will take such other actions that American Express Company or its affiliates determines may be necessary or desirable.
