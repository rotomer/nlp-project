NEW YORK - APRIL 19, 2007 - AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY today reported first quarter income from continuing operations of $1.1 billion, up 22 percent from $876 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.88, up 26 percent from $0.70. Net income for the quarter also totaled $1.1 billion, up 21 percent from $873 million a year ago, and $0.87 per share, up 26 percent from $0.69. Consolidated revenues net of interest expense rose 10 percent to $6.7 billion, up from $6.1 billion a year ago. Consolidated expenses totaled $4.2 billion, up 4 percent from $4.1 billion a year ago. The Company's return on equity (ROE) was 36.6 percent. "Higher revenues, combined with tight controls on discretionary expenses, delivered excellent bottom line results for the quarter," said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive. "Net income for the quarter was a record, exceeding the $1 billion level for the first time since the Ameriprise spin-off in late 2005. "Our strong revenue growth reflects the benefit of multi-year investments in our payments business that are generating across-the-board spending growth from consumer, small business and corporate Cardmembers. "Our ability to customize marketing and reward programs for areas with the highest returns helped us to start the year with strong momentum. "Our performance was again at the top of the industry, with Cardmember spending up 15 percent and loan volumes up 29 percent. We also added nearly 2 million cards-in-force this quarter. "Credit quality was very strong, reflecting our management controls and continued success in the premium sector. Key indicators are returning to a more traditional range compared to the unusually good levels of a year ago." -2-
The first quarter results included: o An $80 million ($50 million after-tax) gain in connection with the initial adoption of a new accounting standard that requires the Company to record in its Consolidated Statements of Income changes in the fair market value of its retained interest in securitized cardmember loans (these changes in fair market value were previously recorded in shareholders' equity); o A $63 million ($39 million after-tax) gain related to changes in the Company's U.S. pension plans; and o A $60 million (pretax and after-tax) reserve established for regulatory and legal exposure at American Express Bank International (a subsidiary of American Express Bank Ltd.). Also included in the quarter was $32 million ($21 million after-tax) of reengineering costs related primarily to restructuring initiatives throughout the Company. Significant items in the year-ago quarter included: o A $112 million ($73 million after-tax) charge associated with certain adjustments made to the Membership Rewards reserve model in the U.S.; o A $72 million ($47 million after-tax) reduction in cardmember lending finance revenue, and securitization income, net, related to higher than anticipated Cardmember completion of consumer debt repayment programs and certain associated payment waivers; and o An $88 million ($40 million after-tax) gain from the sale of an investment in Egyptian American Bank (EAB). Also included in the year-ago quarter was $25 million ($16 million after-tax) of reengineering costs. -3-
In addition, the year-ago quarter results included a favorable impact from lower early credit write offs, in the aftermath of bankruptcy legislation changes and lower than expected costs associated with Hurricane Katrina that had been provided for in 2005. These benefits were partially offset by higher provisions for losses in Taiwan due primarily to the impact of industry-wide credit issues. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Discontinued operations (primarily businesses sold in previous years) reflected a loss of $8 million this quarter compared to a $3 million loss a year ago. SEGMENT RESULTS AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPANY HAD BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) REGARDING ITS REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS. THE COMPANY RECENTLY COMPLETED ITS DISCUSSIONS WITH THE SEC. AS A RESULT OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS, TRAVELERS CHEQUES & PREPAID SERVICES (PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN U.S. CARD SERVICES) AND INTERNATIONAL BANKING BUSINESSES (PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN INTERNATIONAL CARD & GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES) ARE NOW REPORTED IN THE CORPORATE & OTHER SEGMENT. THE FOLLOWING SEGMENT DISCUSSION, AS WELL AS THE SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED, REFLECT THESE CHANGES. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF FIRST QUARTER RESULTS PRESENTS ALL SEGMENTS ON A GAAP BASIS. U.S. CARD SERVICES reported first quarter net income of $644 million, up 22 percent from $527 million a year ago. Revenues net of interest expense for the first quarter increased 16 percent to $3.4 billion, reflecting higher spending and borrowing by consumers and small businesses. Cardmember lending finance revenue increased 57 percent, reflecting substantial growth in owned loan volume. Securitization income, net, increased 18 percent, primarily due to the initial adoption of a new accounting -4-
standard. Revenues in last year's first quarter were reduced by the previously mentioned costs associated with a higher than anticipated number of Cardmembers completing consumer debt repayment programs. Total expenses decreased 1 percent. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses decreased 7 percent from the year-ago period, which included a $106 million charge for certain adjustments to the Membership Rewards reserve model. Lower marketing and promotion expenses this quarter were offset by a volume-related increase in rewards costs. Human resources and other operating expenses increased 8 percent, reflecting higher technology costs, professional services and reengineering costs. These items were partially offset by $36 million of the gain from changes to the Company's U.S. pension plans. Provisions for losses increased 89 percent reflecting higher loan volumes and an increase in write-off and delinquency rates from the unusually low levels that followed the bankruptcy legislation mentioned earlier. INTERNATIONAL CARD & GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES reported first quarter net income of $235 million, up 64 percent from $143 million a year ago. Revenues net of interest expense increased 3 percent to $2.0 billion, reflecting higher spending by corporate and international consumer Cardmembers, as well as higher loan balances. These increases were partially offset by last year's sale of card-related operations in Brazil, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Total expenses were flat. Human resources and other operating expenses decreased 2 percent, benefiting from $21 million of the previously mentioned pension gain. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses increased 7 percent. An increase in volume-related rewards costs was partially offset by lower marketing and promotion expenses. Provisions for losses decreased 19 percent from year-ago levels, which had reflected industry-wide credit issues in Taiwan. -5-
GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES reported first quarter net income of $236 million, up 42 percent from $166 million a year ago. Revenues net of interest expense for the first quarter increased 17 percent to $877 million. The increase reflects continued strong growth in merchant-related revenue primarily resulting from higher company-wide billed business. The increase also reflects higher network partner-related fees. Spending on Global Network Services cards increased 59 percent from year-ago levels. Cards-in-force issued by bank partners increased 45 percent. These increases also reflect, in part, the completion in 2006 of independent operator agreements in Brazil, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Total expenses increased 10 percent. Human resources and other operating expenses increased 15 percent reflecting increased staffing levels and technology costs. Partially offsetting these increases was a 4 percent decrease in brand-related marketing and promotion expenses. Provisions for losses in the quarter reflect a reduction in merchant-related reserves. CORPORATE & OTHER reported first quarter net expenses of $50 million, compared with net income of $40 million a year ago. Expenses for the quarter included the previously mentioned reserves established at American Express Bank International. The year-ago quarter included an $88 million ($40 million after-tax) gain related to the completion of the sale of the Company's investment in EAB. *** American Express Company (www.americanexpress.com) is a leading global payments, network and travel company founded in 1850.

(Preliminary) U.S. CARD SERVICES SELECTED INCOME STATEMENT DATA (Millions) -12-
(Preliminary) U.S. CARD SERVICES SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION MANAGED BASIS PRESENTATION (Millions) For U.S. Card Services, the managed basis presentation assumes that there have been no off-balance sheet securitization transactions, i.e., all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the Company's balance sheets and income statements, respectively. For the managed basis presentation, revenue and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans are reflected in net card fees and other, cardmember lending finance revenue, cardmember lending interest expense and credit provision. On a managed basis, there is no securitization income, net, as the managed basis presentation assumes no securitization transactions have occurred. The Company presents U.S. Card Services information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Management also believes that use of a managed basis presentation presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business. Irrespective of the on and off-balance sheet funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant in evaluating the Company's performance and can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The Company does not currently securitize international loans. -13-

These changes in fair value were previously recorded in shareholders' equity; -- A $63MM ($39MM after-tax) gain relating to amendments to the Company's U.S. pension plans, effective July 1, 2007, that reduced accumulated pension obligations to plan participants; and -- A $60MM pre-tax and after-tax charge related to a reserve established for regulatory and legal exposure at American Express Bank International ("AEBI"), a subsidiary of American Express Bank Ltd. - 1Q '06 Income from continuing operations included: -- A $112MM ($73MM after-tax) charge related to a higher redemption rate estimate within the U.S. Membership Rewards reserve; -- A $72MM ($47MM after-tax) reduction in cardmember lending finance revenues and securitization income related to higher than anticipated cardmember completion of consumer debt repayment programs and certain associated payment waivers; -- An $88MM ($40MM after-tax) gain related to the completion of the sale of our stake in Egyptian American Bank ("EAB"); and -- Higher provisions for credit losses in Taiwan due primarily to the impact of industry-wide credit issues within the market, which were more than offset by the favorable impact from lower early credit write offs related to the October 2005 bankruptcy legislation in the U.S., and lower than expected costs related to Hurricane Katrina that had been provided for in 2005. - 1Q '07 and 1Q '06 Income from continuing operations included $32MM ($21MM after-tax) and $25MM ($16MM after-tax), respectively, of reengineering costs related to restructuring efforts primarily in our technology activities, as well as within our Travelers Cheque, corporate travel and other businesses. - On September 30, 2005, the Company completed the distribution of all the outstanding shares of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (formerly American Express Financial Advisors) to its shareholders. In Q3 '05 the Company also sold its Tax and Business Services ("TBS") business and in 2Q '06 completed the sale of its international banking operations in Brazil to Banco Bradesco S.A. The operating results, gain or loss on the sales, and assets and liabilities related to businesses spun-off and sold are included in discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements. -- 1Q '07 results reflected $8MM of expense from discontinued operations, primarily related to the TBS business, versus $3MM of expense last year. -- Including discontinued operations, diluted EPS on a net income basis of $0.87 increased 26% versus last year. BUSINESS METRICS o Compared with the first quarter of 2006: - Worldwide billed business of $146.2B increased 15% on continued strong growth within both the proprietary and network businesses. A comparatively weaker U.S. dollar resulted in a 2% benefit within the reported worldwide growth rate; - Worldwide total cards in force of 79.9MM increased 10%, up 7.4MM from last year and 1.9MM during 1Q `07, as proprietary and network card growth remained strong; - Worldwide average spending per proprietary basic card in force increased 8% versus last year despite the suppressing effect of substantial card additions over the past few years; - Worldwide lending balances of $42.3B on an owned basis increased 29%; on a managed basis, worldwide lending balances of $63.2B were up 18%; and - Underlying card credit quality continued to be well controlled and reserve coverage ratios remained strong. CAPITAL RETURNED TO SHAREHOLDERS o Including share repurchases and dividends, during 1Q '07 we returned 89% of capital generated to shareholders. On a cumulative basis, since 1994, we have returned 69% of capital generated. - SHARE REPURCHASES: During 1Q '07, 16MM shares were repurchased versus 18MM shares in 4Q '06 and in 1Q '06. Since the inception of repurchase programs in December 1994, 622MM shares have been acquired under cumulative Board authorizations to repurchase up to 770MM shares, including purchases made under agreements with third parties. -1-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS ADDITIONAL ITEMS OF NOTE o Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services costs decreased 4% versus 1Q '06, reflecting the 1Q '06 charge to the U.S. Membership Rewards reserve and lower marketing and promotion costs in 1Q '07, which were partially offset by higher volume-related rewards costs. Marketing expenses reflect reduced levels of spending related to various product-specific advertising, creative development and market research initiatives, in addition to a reallocation of select acquisition investments to lower cost channels. The higher rewards costs continued to reflect volume growth, a higher redemption rate, and strong cardmember loyalty program participation. o Total provisions for losses and benefits increased 30% versus 1Q '06, reflecting growth in business volumes and the loan portfolio and increased write-off and delinquency rates within the lending portfolio, which have been gradually rising after the unusually low rates that followed the enactment of the October 2005 U.S. bankruptcy legislation. These were partially offset by lower Taiwan-related provisions, a reduction in merchant-related reserves, and improved results from charge card-related collection activities. o The Company's reengineering initiatives delivered in excess of $250MM of additional benefits this quarter, including significant carry-over benefits from certain initiatives begun in prior periods. Revenue-related reengineering activities continue to drive a significant portion of the total benefits, representing more than 30% of the benefits delivered in 1Q '07. o The 3% increase in human resources expense in 1Q '07 reflects the impact of merit increases and larger incentive, benefit and severance-related costs, partially offset by the $63MM pension-related gain, and a cash payment received in connection with the departure of our former CFO. - Compared with last year, the total employee count of 66,000 decreased by 700 employees or 1%; compared with last quarter, the employee count increased by 600 employees or 1%. o Pursuant to the completion of discussions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) referenced in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company has made certain modifications to its reportable operating segment disclosures. The Travelers Cheque and Prepaid Services ("TCPS") business, previously included in the U.S. Card Services ("USCS") segment, and international banking businesses, previously included in the International Card & Global Commercial Services ("ICGCS") segment, are now included in the Corporate & Other segment. The discussion and financial data included herein reflect these modifications. o SFAS No. 155, "Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments -- an amendment of FASB Statements (SFAS) No. 133 and 140", ends the temporary exemption of beneficial interests in securitized assets from the bifurcation requirements of SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 155 requires fair value re-measurement of any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. This primarily affects the Company's accounting for its interest-only strips, where the changes in fair value were previously recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income in shareholders' equity. After adoption of SFAS No. 155 on January 1, 2007, as the interest-only strip is subject to a re-measurement event, the Company now records fair value measurement for the instrument, which requires changes in its fair value to be recognized in earnings rather than in other comprehensive (loss) income. SFAS No. 155 applies to all financial instruments acquired or issued after December 31, 2006. As previously discussed, the Company recorded an $80MM ($50MM after-tax) gain in connection with the required adoption. Any future changes in the fair value of the interest-only strip will be reflected in the Company's net income. o FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes -- an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" (FIN 48), is an interpretation that clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of benefits associated with tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For any amount of those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. The measurement of the benefit recognized is based on the Company's best judgment as to the most likely outcome on settlement of the tax position. FIN 48 is applicable to all tax positions as of January 1, 2007. The initial effect of adoption, which was a $127MM charge as of January 1, 2007, is reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to income taxes payable (in other liabilities) and retained earnings. REVISED STATEMENTS OF INCOME PRESENTATION o As described in the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 30, 2007, beginning with the first quarter of 2007, the Company revised the presentation of its Consolidated Statements of Income. The revised Consolidated Statements of Income include the separate presentation of certain interest income and interest expense amounts which previously had been reported on a net basis as well as the separate presentation of the provisions for losses and benefits from expenses. While these revisions impact the presentation of revenues and expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income, they have no impact on the Company's previously reported consolidated pretax income, income taxes, net income, total assets, total liabilities, or total shareholders' equity. -2-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS o The revised consolidated presentation includes the following: - Gross cardmember lending finance charge revenue is presented in the line entitled "Cardmember lending finance revenue" within the new "Interest income" section of the Consolidated Statements of Income, and the related gross interest expense is presented in the line entitled "Cardmember lending" within the new "Interest expense" section of the Consolidated Statements of Income. These amounts were previously presented on a net basis as "Cardmember lending finance charge revenue, net of interest" within the "Net revenues" section; - Gross investment and other interest income is presented in the lines entitled "International banking" or "Other" within the new "Interest income" section, and gross interest expense related to international banking is presented in "International banking" within the new "Interest expense" section. These amounts were previously presented on a net basis as "Other investment and interest income, net of interest" within the "Net revenues" section; - Other interest expense is presented in the line entitled "Charge card and other" within the new "Interest expense" section, and certain other interest income is presented in the line entitled "Other" within the new "Interest income" section. These amounts were previously reported on a net basis in "Interest" within the "Expenses" section; - "Provisions for losses and benefits" is presented in a new separate section. These amounts were previously reported in the "Provisions for losses and benefits" lines within the "Expenses" section; and - Certain other amounts were revised to conform to the method of presentation or calculation that will be used in 2007. o Corresponding revisions to the Selected Income Statement Data presentation regarding the Company's reportable operating segments were also made. o "Total revenues" and "Revenues net of interest expense" are presented separately within the revised Consolidated Statements of Income presentation. "Revenues net of interest expense" is now the measure for the Company's long-term revenue growth rate target. This target (of at least 8 percent growth on average and over time) has not been changed as a result of the revisions to the presentation of the Consolidated Statements of Income. o The changes in the presentation of the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income were made in connection with the previously mentioned discussions that the Company had with the staff of the SEC related to a review of the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005. o Separately, the Company revised the method of reporting certain credit statistics related to the charge card business to better align these metrics with the way the Company manages credit risk as well as to align such credit statistics with the method used for reporting the Company's lending activities. Historically, the credit statistics for the charge card business have been presented using the portion of the account balance that was 90 days past due or more. However, the Company's practices for managing credit risk and establishing reserves for uncollectible amounts consider the entire amounts of customer accounts for those accounts which have any portion that is past due by 90 days or more, and thus certain statistics have been revised to reflect this. Finally, the calculation of net finance revenue divided by average loans for both consolidated reporting and the ICGCS segment has been corrected for a computational error. This correction has a minimal impact on the historic trends for this statistical information. For more detail relating to the changes and a presentation of revised historical financials and statistics, please see the Company's Form 8-K, filed with the SEC March 30, 2007. EXPANDED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES o On April 9, 2007, the Company launched a new marketing campaign with the theme "Are You a Cardmember?" The new campaign showcases the value of American Express membership and its array of special benefits and services, focusing on travel, access, and community. o During the quarter, American Express continued to invest in growth opportunities through expanded products and services. In our proprietary business we: - Launched Flight Finder and Room Finder, two innovative online tools for booking award travel. Flight Finder and Room Finder enable Charge Cardmembers enrolled in Membership Rewards(R) to easily search award inventory, transfer points directly into a frequent flyer or frequent guest account, and book flights or hotel stays in a single online transaction. - Enhanced the OPEN from American Express(R) Business Platinum Card(R) and the Platinum Card(R), with the expansion of certain travel and business benefits, including: complimentary domestic companion airfare; web content and special offers; the launch of the Platinum Office Program which provides various workplace solutions and office services; the expansion of the hotels and destinations in the Fine Hotels & Resorts Program; increased baggage insurance; and the expansion of coverage for the Premium Global Assist(R) hotline. Additionally, we announced an annual fee increase on both cards, in order to support their high level of benefits and services as well as reflect their value. - Added Delta Air Lines to the existing 18 partners in our International Airline Program (IAP), which is exclusively available to Platinum Card and Centurion Card members and which allows them to receive complimentary companion tickets on qualifying international flights with the purchase of a first or business class ticket, depending on the carrier. - Added richer benefits to the Delta SkyMiles Cards, for both consumer and small business cardmembers, including opportunities to earn additional bonus miles and receive companion certificates upon renewal with no blackout dates and no minimum fare restrictions. - Expanded our merchant rollout of ExpressPay from American Express through agreements with Tully's Coffee Corporation, a leading specialty coffee retailer with stores in Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho and Arizona, as well as with ShopRite, who will accept the product at over 200 of its supermarket locations in New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Delaware. -3-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS - Unveiled S2S(SM) eInvoice&Pay, the first fully integrated Electronic Invoice Presentment and Payment (EIPP) solution, allowing companies to process 100% of their invoices and issue payments to suppliers from a single online portal managed by American Express. - Announced an agreement under which Citibank is selling the American Express(R) Gift Card in more than 980 Citibank retail Financial Centers nationwide. This is American Express' first Gift Card distribution agreement with a national bank. - Added two travel agencies in Ohio and Texas to the American Express Travel U.S. Representative Network, which provides a wide range of travel and financial services to travelers and American Express Cardmembers. In our Global Network Services ("GNS") business we: - Signed an agreement with Banco Itau, one of the leading banks in Brazil with the largest base of high net worth customers, to issue and market the 'Blue Box' line of cards on the American Express network. - Signed an agreement with Tarjeta Naranja, a leader in the Argentine credit card market, to issue American Express-branded cards, both in pesos and U.S. dollar denominations, which will be accepted and processed on the American Express network. - Launched a new partnership with Alpha Bank to issue American Express products and acquire merchants in Macedonia. - Launched the SunMiles American Express Card, a new airline co-brand card issued by the Bank of Cyprus and Cyprus Airways. -4-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED Note: Amounts herein reflect certain revisions as noted on pages 2-3 and in the Company's Form 8-K, filed with the SEC March 30, 2007. # Denotes variance of more than 100%. -5-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED o CONSOLIDATED REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE: Consolidated revenues net of interest expense increased 10%, reflecting increases versus last year of 16% within USCS, 3% within ICGCS and 17% within Global Network & Merchant Services ("GNMS"). Revenues net of interest expense increased due to higher interest income, greater discount revenues, increased securitization income, net, greater travel commissions and fees and higher other revenues, partially offset by increased interest expense, lower net card fee revenue and lower other commissions and fees. Translation of foreign currency benefited the revenues net of interest growth rate by 1%. o CONSOLIDATED EXPENSES: Consolidated expenses increased 4%, reflecting an increase of 10% within GNMS, a flat expense level within ICGCS, and a 1% decline in USCS. Expense growth reflected higher other expenses, greater professional services expenses, higher human resources expense and increased occupancy and equipment costs, partially offset by lower marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services costs. Translation of foreign currency contributed 1% to the expense growth rate. o CONSOLIDATED PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES AND BENEFITS: Consolidated provisions for losses and benefits increased 30% versus last year, reflecting an 89% increase in USCS, a 19% decrease in ICGCS, and a $29MM decrease in GNMS. Provisions rose primarily due to an increase in the cardmember lending provision, partially offset by a reduction in the international banking and other provision. Charge card provisions were unchanged. Translation of foreign currency contributed 2% to the provision growth rate. o PRE-TAX MARGIN: Was 23.9% in 1Q '07 compared with 17.8% in 4Q '06 and 21.9% in 1Q '06. o EFFECTIVE TAX RATE: Was 33% in 1Q '07 versus 24% in 4Q '06 and 34% in 1Q '06. The 4Q '06 rate reflected $52MM of tax benefits principally related to certain foreign losses and the finalization of state tax returns. o DISCOUNT REVENUE: A 15% increase in billed business, partially offset by the relatively faster GNS billed business growth and higher cash-back rewards costs, yielded a 13% increase in discount revenue. - The average discount rate* was 2.58% in 1Q '07 and in 1Q '06 compared to 2.55% in 4Q '06. The increase versus 4Q '06 reflects the seasonally higher retail spend levels during the fourth quarter. As indicated in prior quarters, selective repricing initiatives, continued changes in the mix of business and volume-related pricing discounts will likely result in some erosion of the average discount rate over time. * For additional information about billed business and discount rate calculations, please refer to the First Quarter 2007 Earnings Release, American Express Company Selected Statistical Information pages. ** Proprietary card activity only. -6-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED - - WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS: The 15% increase in worldwide billed business reflected a 13% increase in USCS, a 12% increase in ICGCS, and a 59% increase in GNS partner volume. The table below summarizes selected billed business related statistics for 1Q '07: * Captions not designated as "proprietary" include both proprietary and GNS data. ** Included in USCS. *** Included in ICGCS. -- U.S. non-T&E-related volume categories (which represented approximately 66% of 1Q '07 U.S. billed business) grew 15%, while T&E volumes rose 9%. -- U.S. airline-related volume, which represented approximately 10% of total U.S. volumes during the quarter, increased 6% due to a 5% increase in transactions and a 1% higher average airline charge. -- Worldwide airline volumes, which represented approximately 13% of total volumes during the quarter, increased 10% on 5% growth in transactions and a 5% increase in the average airline charge. -- Assuming no changes in foreign exchange rates: Total billed business outside the U.S. reflected double-digit proprietary growth in Europe and Canada, high single-digit growth in Asia Pacific, and a decline in Latin America. Excluding the impact of the 2Q '06 sale in Brazil and the 3Q '06 sales in Malaysia and Indonesia, Latin America and Asia also exhibited double-digit proprietary growth. Excluding the impact of all three sales, total proprietary growth outside the U.S. was 11%. - - TOTAL CARDS IN FORCE: Rose 10% worldwide due to an increase of 8% in USCS, a 3% decline in ICGCS and a 45% increase in GNS. Continued strong card acquisitions within both proprietary and GNS activities, as well as continued solid average customer retention levels, drove these results. The sale of our card activities in Brazil in 2Q '06, and Malaysia and Indonesia in 3Q '06, resulted in the transfer of 1.5MM cards from ICGCS to GNMS, suppressing ICGCS' and increasing GNMS' respective growth rates. -- 1.2MM and 700K net cards were added during the quarter in the U.S. and the non-U.S. businesses, respectively. o NET CARD FEES: Decreased 7% as the benefit of card growth was offset by the reclassification of certain card acquisition-related costs, beginning July 1, 2006, from other operating expense to a reduction in net card fees. This reclassification had no effect on net income and is not included in the average fee per card calculation. The average annual fee per proprietary card in force was $35 in 1Q '07 and 4Q '06 versus $34 in 1Q '06. o TRAVEL COMMISSIONS AND FEES: Increased 5% reflecting an 8% increase in travel sales. o OTHER COMMISSIONS AND FEES: Decreased 3% as higher card-related assessment and service fees and higher conversion revenues were more than offset by the 2Q '06 sale in Brazil and a reclassification in 2Q '06 and 3Q '06 of certain third-party merchant-related revenues from Other Commissions and Fees to Discount Revenue. o SECURITIZATION INCOME, NET: Increased 18% as the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 155, a higher portfolio yield, and the negative impact in 1Q '06 of higher than anticipated cardmember completion of consumer debt repayment programs were partially offset by an increase in write offs and greater interest expense, due to a higher coupon rate paid to certificate holders, as well as a lower average balance of securitized loans. Securitization income, net represents the non-credit provision components of the gains from securitization activities within the USCS segment, fair value changes and impairment charges, if any, of the related interest-only strip, excess spread related to securitized loans, net finance revenue on retained interests in securitized loans, and servicing income, net of related discounts or fees. -7-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED * Excess spread is the net positive cash flow from interest and fee collections allocated to the investor's interests after deducting the interest paid on investor certificates, credit losses, contractual servicing fees and other expenses. Also included is the previously mentioned $80MM gain in 1Q '07 related to the re-measurement of the interest-only strip asset and a $29MM reduction in 1Q '06 related to higher than anticipated cardmember completion of consumer debt repayment programs. ** Excludes $35MM and $(20)MM in 2007 and $35MM and $(43)MM in 2006 of impact from cardmember loan sales and maturities, respectively, reflected in credit provision. - - The average balance of Cardmember lending securitizations was $20.4B in 1Q '07, compared with $21.3B in 1Q '06. o OTHER REVENUES: Increased 5% primarily due to higher network partner-related fees and insurance-related revenues. o CARDMEMBER LENDING FINANCE REVENUE: Increased 44% due to 31% growth in average worldwide lending balances on an owned basis and a higher portfolio yield, which reflects increased finance charge rates and a lower proportion of the U.S. portfolio on promotional rates. The increase also reflects the $43MM negative impact in 1Q '06 of higher than anticipated cardmember completion of consumer debt repayment programs. o INTERNATIONAL BANKING INTEREST INCOME: Increased 3% reflecting higher volumes and interest rates. o OTHER INTEREST INCOME: Increased 22% primarily due to the recognition of interest income associated with the Company's loan to Delta Air Lines that was placed back on accrual status. o CARDMEMBER LENDING INTEREST EXPENSE: Increased 57% reflecting increased loan balances and a higher cost of funds. o INTERNATIONAL BANKING INTEREST EXPENSE: Increased 43% reflecting higher volumes and interest rates. o CHARGE CARD AND OTHER INTEREST EXPENSE: Increased 36% reflecting a higher cost of funds and increased receivable balances. o MARKETING, PROMOTION, REWARDS AND CARDMEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES: Decreased 4%, primarily due to the previously discussed 1Q '06 charge to the Membership Rewards reserve and lower marketing and promotion costs, which were partially offset by higher volume-related rewards costs. o HUMAN RESOURCES EXPENSE: Increased 3% due to merit increases and larger incentive, benefit and severance-related costs, partially offset by the $63MM pension-related gain and the cash payment received in connection with the departure of our former CFO, discussed previously. o PROFESSIONAL SERVICES EXPENSE: Rose 12%, primarily reflecting higher technology service fees. o OCCUPANCY AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSE: Rose 7% due to costs associated with higher business and service-related volumes. o COMMUNICATIONS EXPENSE: Increased 3%. o OTHER EXPENSE: Increased 26%, however, excluding the charge related to the regulatory and legal reserve established for AEBI, the reclassification of certain card-acquisition costs to card fee revenue beginning July 1, 2006, and the gain on the sale of our stake in EAB in 1Q '06, underlying expenses were flat. -8-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED o CHARGE CARD PROVISION FOR LOSSES AND BENEFITS: Remained flat, as higher volumes were offset by improved results from collection activities. - WORLDWIDE CHARGE CARD:* -- The loss ratio declined versus last quarter, but increased compared to last year. Past due rates declined versus last year, but rose versus last quarter. *There are no off-balance sheet Charge Card securitizations. Therefore, all credit quality statistics for the Charge Card portfolio are on an "Owned Basis." Note: Amounts herein reflect certain revisions as noted on pages 2-3 and in the Company's Form 8-K, filed with the SEC March 30, 2007. o CARDMEMBER LENDING PROVISION FOR LOSSES AND BENEFITS: Increased 79% due to increased loan volumes and higher write-off and delinquency rates, which have been rising after the unusually low rates that followed the October 2005 change in the U.S. bankruptcy legislation partially offset by lower provisions in Taiwan. - WORLDWIDE LENDING:* -- Both the write-off rate and the past due rate increased versus last year and last quarter, reflecting the waning benefit since 1Q `06 of the October 2005 bankruptcy legislation. * All lending statistics are presented here on a GAAP or "Owned Basis". "Managed Basis" credit quality statistics are available in the First Quarter 2007 Earnings Release on the American Express Company Consolidated Selected Statistical Information pages. Credit trends are generally consistent under both reporting methods. o INTERNATIONAL BANKING AND OTHER PROVISION FOR LOSSES AND BENEFITS: Decreased 40% primarily due to a reduction in merchant-related reserves attributable to our relationship with Delta Air Lines and lower provisions related to Taiwan. -9-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY AND TOTAL ADJUSTED ASSETS During the third quarter of 2006, the Company issued $750MM of 6.80% Subordinated Debentures due 2036 ("Subordinated Debentures"), which are automatically extendable until 2066 unless certain events occur prior to that date. In connection with the Subordinated Debentures, the Company has undertaken to disclose on a quarterly basis the amount of its "tangible common equity" and "total adjusted assets". The Company's consolidated tangible common equity amount as of the end of any fiscal quarter means the total shareholders' equity, excluding preferred stock, of the Company as reflected on its consolidated balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP as of such fiscal quarter end minus (i) intangible assets and goodwill and (ii) deferred acquisition costs, as determined in accordance with GAAP and reflected in such consolidated balance sheet. The Company calculates total adjusted assets as of the end of any fiscal quarter as the sum of (i) total consolidated assets as reflected on the Company's balance sheet minus (ii) non-securitized Cardmember lending receivables (without deduction for reserves), which are set forth on the Company's balance sheet, plus (iii) managed (i.e., securitized and non-securitized) worldwide Cardmember lending receivables as reported by the Company for such fiscal quarter. As of March 31, 2007, the Company's tangible common equity was $9B and its total adjusted assets were $147B. As of March 31, 2007, the consolidated assets, as reflected on the Company's balance sheet, were $126B. CORPORATE & OTHER Net expense was $50MM in 1Q '07 compared with net income of $35MM in 4Q '06 and $40MM in 1Q '06. The 1Q '07 expense includes the previously mentioned $60MM charge for a reserve established for regulatory and legal exposure at AEBI, $4MM ($3MM after-tax) of reengineering costs, in addition to the previously mentioned benefit reflecting the payment associated with the departure of our former CFO. The 4Q '06 income included a $68MM ($42MM after-tax) gain related to the rebalancing of our Travelers Cheque and Gift Card investment portfolio, as well as $9MM ($6MM after-tax) of reengineering costs. The 1Q '06 income included an $88MM ($40MM after-tax) gain related to the completion of the sale of our stake in EAB, in addition to $7MM ($4MM after-tax) of reengineering expenses. -10-

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW U.S. CARD SERVICES - 1Q '07 included $14MM ($9MM after-tax) of reengineering costs, related principally to technology and other business activities. There were no reengineering costs in 1Q '06. - PRE-TAX MARGIN: Was 30.6% in 1Q '07 versus 21.6% in 4Q '06 and 28.4% in 1Q '06. - EFFECTIVE TAX RATE: Was 38% in 1Q '07 compared to 35% in 4Q '06 and 36% in 1Q '06. o DISCOUNT REVENUE, NET CARD FEES AND OTHER REVENUES: Increased 10%, largely due to higher billed business volumes, higher travel commissions and fees and greater other revenues, partially offset by lower card fees and other commissions and fees. o CARDMEMBER LENDING FINANCE REVENUE: Increased 57% due to 38% growth in average owned lending balances and a higher portfolio yield, in addition to the negative impact in 1Q '06 of higher than anticipated completion of consumer debt repayment programs. o SECURITIZATION INCOME, NET: Increased 18% as the impact of the adoption of SFAS No.155, a higher portfolio yield, and the negative impact in 1Q '06 of higher than anticipated cardmember completion of consumer debt repayment programs were partially offset by an increase in write offs and greater interest expense, due to a higher coupon rate paid to certificate holders, as well as a lower average balance of securitized loans. o CARDMEMBER LENDING INTEREST EXPENSE: Increased 61% on higher loan balances and a higher cost of funds. o CHARGE CARD AND OTHER INTEREST EXPENSE: Increased 54% due to higher funding costs and a greater receivables balance. o MARKETING, PROMOTION, REWARDS AND CARDMEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES: Decreased 7%, primarily due to the previously mentioned 1Q '06 adjustment to the Membership Rewards reserve and lower marketing and promotion costs, which were partially offset by higher volume-related rewards costs. o HUMAN RESOURCES AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES: Increased 8% due to higher human resources costs, professional services expenses and generally higher volume-related costs, which were partially offset by the pension-related gain discussed earlier and the 3Q '06 reclassification to revenues of certain card acquisition-related costs. o PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES: Increased 89% as the impact of strong volume and loan growth and increased write offs and delinquency rates within the lending portfolio, which have been gradually rising after the unusually low rates following the enactment of the October 2005 U.S. bankruptcy legislation, were partially offset by improved collections activities in the charge card business. - CHARGE CARD: * -- The loss ratio increased from last year but decreased from last quarter. The past due rate decreased versus last year, but increased versus last quarter. Note: Amounts herein reflect certain revisions as noted on pages 2-3 and in the Company's Form 8-K, filed with the SEC March 30, 2007. - CARDMEMBER LENDING: ** -- The write-off rate and past due rate both increased versus last year and last quarter, reflecting the waning benefit of the October 2005 bankruptcy legislation. * There are no off-balance sheet Charge Card securitizations.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW U.S. CARD SERVICES MANAGED BASIS For USCS, the managed basis presentation assumes that there have been no off-balance sheet securitization transactions, i.e., all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the Company's balance sheets and income statements, respectively. For the managed basis presentation, revenue and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans are reflected in net card fees and other, cardmember lending finance revenue, cardmember lending interest expense and credit provision. On a managed basis, there is no securitization income, net, as the managed basis presentation assumes no securitization transactions have occurred. The Company presents USCS information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Management also believes that use of a managed basis presentation presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business. Irrespective of the on- and off-balance sheet funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant in evaluating the Company's performance and can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The Company does not currently securitize international loans. On a GAAP basis, revenue and expenses from securitized cardmember loans are reflected in the Company's income statements in securitization income, net, fees and commissions, and credit provision for cardmember lending. At the time of a securitization transaction, the securitized cardmember loans are removed from the Company's balance sheet, and the resulting gain on sale is reflected in securitization income, net, as well as an impact to credit provision (credit reserves are no longer recorded for the cardmember loans once sold). Over the life of a securitization transaction, the Company recognizes servicing fees and other net revenues (referred to as "excess spread") related to the interests sold to investors (i.e., the investors' interests). These amounts are reflected in securitization income, net, and fees and commissions. The Company also recognizes cardmember lending finance revenue over the life of the securitization transaction related to the interest it retains (i.e., the seller's interest). At the maturity of a securitization transaction, cardmember loans on the balance sheet increase, and the impact of the incremental required loss reserves is recorded in credit provision. As presented, in aggregate over the life of a securitization transaction, the pretax income impact to the Company is the same whether or not the Company had securitized cardmember loans or funded these loans through other financing activities (assuming the same financing costs). The income statement classifications, however, of specific items will differ. The following information reconciles the GAAP basis presentation for certain USCS income statement line items to the managed basis presentation, where different: Note: Amounts herein reflect certain revisions as noted on pages 2-3 and in the Company's Form 8-K, filed with the SEC March 30, 2007. -13-

The lower 4Q'06 tax rate reflects benefits principally related to the recognition of certain foreign losses. o DISCOUNT REVENUE, NET CARD FEES AND OTHER REVENUES: The increase of 4% versus 1Q '06 was driven primarily by the higher level of card spending and greater travel commissions and fees, and other revenues partially offset by decreased card-related fees due to the reclassification of certain card-related acquisition costs effective July 1, 2006, as well as a decline in other commissions and assessments. Growth was also suppressed by the impact of the sales last year of card-related operations in Brazil, Malaysia and Indonesia. o CARDMEMBER LENDING FINANCE REVENUE: Increased 14% on 12% growth in average lending balances. o CARDMEMBER LENDING INTEREST EXPENSE: Increased 21% on higher loan balances and a higher cost of funds. o CHARGE CARD AND OTHER INTEREST EXPENSE: Increased 28% on higher volumes and a greater cost of funds. o MARKETING, PROMOTION, REWARDS AND CARDMEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES: Increased 7%, reflecting greater volume-related rewards costs partially offset by a reduction in marketing and promotion costs. o HUMAN RESOURCES AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES: Decreased 2% due to greater human resources expenses which were more than offset by the previously discussed pension-related gain, the reclassification to revenues of certain card acquisition-related costs, and the impact of the 2Q'06 and 3Q'06 sales of card operations in Brazil, Malaysia and Indonesia. o PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES: Decreased 19% from a year ago, which included the negative impact of industry-wide credit issues in Taiwan, partially offset by spending and loan volume-driven increases. - CHARGE CARD: * -- The loss ratio rose versus last year and last quarter.

The increase also reflects the completion in 2Q '06 and 3Q '06 of independent operator agreements in Brazil, Malaysia and Indonesia. o CARDMEMBER LENDING INTEREST EXPENSE: The expense credit increased 40% due to a larger volume-related interest credit related to internal transfer pricing which recognizes the merchant services' accounts payable-related funding benefit. o OTHER INTEREST EXPENSE: The expense credit increased 14% due to a larger volume-related interest credit related to internal transfer pricing which recognizes the merchant services' accounts payable-related funding benefit. -17-
