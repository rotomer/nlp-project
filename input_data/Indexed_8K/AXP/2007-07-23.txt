New York - July 23, 2007 - AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY (NYSE: AXP) today reported second quarter income from continuing operations of $1.1 billion, up 9 percent from $972 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.88, up 13 percent from $0.78. Net income for the quarter also totaled $1.1 billion, up 12 percent from $945 million a year ago, and $0.88 per share, up 16 percent from $0.76. Consolidated revenues net of interest expense rose 9 percent to $7.1 billion, up from $6.5 billion a year ago. Consolidated expenses totaled $4.7 billion, up 7 percent from $4.4 billion a year ago. The Company's return on equity (ROE) was 37.5 percent. "Continued growth in Cardmember spending and excellent credit quality generated strong earnings for the quarter," said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive. "Spending on American Express cards rose 15 percent and we added more than 2 million cards during the last three months. "As expected, interest costs increased and provisions rebounded from the exceptionally low levels of last year. We dealt with this short-term challenge by controlling discretionary expenses and carefully targeting our marketing investments. "The result was strong performance in the second quarter and excellent momentum as we head into the latter half of 2007. "Given that momentum, we will be looking to capitalize on opportunities to further strengthen our lead in the payments industry at a time when some key competitors may be cutting back or dealing with weakness in parts of their business." The second quarter results included a $65 million tax benefit from the IRS related to the treatment of certain prior years' card fee income. In light of this benefit, the Company increased its investment in marketing and promotion programs this quarter by $68 million ($42 million after-tax). -2-
Significant items in the year-ago quarter included: o A $144 million ($131 million after-tax) gain related to the sale of the Company's card and merchant-related operations in Brazil to Banco Bradesco S.A.; and o A $62 million ($40 million after-tax) charge associated with certain adjustments made to the Membership Rewards reserve model outside the U.S. Also included in the quarters ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, were $8 million ($5 million after-tax) and $53 million ($34 million after-tax) of reengineering costs, respectively. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Discontinued operations (businesses sold in previous years) included a loss of $5 million this quarter compared to a $27 million loss a year ago, which primarily reflected losses related to last year's sale of the Company's international banking operations in Brazil. SEGMENT RESULTS U.S. CARD SERVICES reported second quarter net income of $580 million, down 2 percent from $594 million a year ago. Revenues net of interest expense for the second quarter increased 12 percent to $3.6 billion, reflecting higher spending and borrowing by consumers and small businesses, which were partially offset by higher interest expense. Securitization income, net decreased 11 percent primarily due to increased write offs. Total expenses increased 11 percent. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses increased 16 percent from the year-ago period primarily due to higher rewards costs and the previously mentioned increase in marketing and promotion programs. Human resources and other operating expenses increased 4 percent. Provisions for losses increased 85 percent, reflecting higher loan volumes and an increase in write-off and delinquency rates from the unusually low levels of a year ago. -3-
Results for the second quarter included $56 million of the previously mentioned tax benefit. INTERNATIONAL CARD & GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES reported second quarter net income of $277 million, up 22 percent from $227 million a year ago. Revenues net of interest expense increased 4 percent to $2.2 billion, reflecting higher spending by corporate and international consumer Cardmembers, as well as higher loan balances. These increases were suppressed by last year's sale of card-related operations in Brazil, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Total expenses increased 5 percent. Human resources and other operating expenses increased 10 percent. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses decreased 8 percent from the year-ago period, which included the previously mentioned $62 million charge for certain adjustments to the Membership Rewards reserve model outside the U.S. Operating expenses for the year-ago period were reduced by the gain on the sale of the card and merchant-related operations in Brazil. Provisions for losses decreased 7 percent from year-ago levels, which had reflected industry-wide credit issues in Taiwan. Results for the second quarter included certain tax benefits, $9 million of which was related to the previously mentioned item. GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES reported second quarter net income of $266 million, up 33 percent from $200 million a year ago. Revenues net of interest expense for the second quarter increased 15 percent to $966 million. The increase reflects continued strong growth in merchant-related revenue primarily resulting from higher company-wide billed business. The increase also reflects higher network partner-related fees. Spending on Global Network Services cards increased 62 percent from year-ago levels. These increases reflect, in part, the completion in 2006 of independent operator agreements in Brazil, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Cards-in-force issued by bank partners increased 34 percent. -4-
Total expenses increased 6 percent, reflecting higher human resources costs and expanded marketing and promotion activities. CORPORATE & OTHER reported second quarter net expenses of $61 million, compared with net expenses of $49 million a year ago. *** American Express Company (www.americanexpress.com) is a leading global payments, network and travel company founded in 1850.

(Preliminary) U.S. CARD SERVICES SELECTED INCOME STATEMENT DATA (Millions) -12-
(Preliminary) U.S. CARD SERVICES SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION MANAGED BASIS PRESENTATION (Millions) For U.S. Card Services, the managed basis presentation assumes that there have been no off-balance sheet securitization transactions, i.e., all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the Company's balance sheets and income statements, respectively. For the managed basis presentation, revenue and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans are reflected in other commissions and fees (included above in discount revenue, net card fees and other), cardmember lending finance revenue, cardmember lending interest expense, and provisions for losses. On a managed basis, there is no securitization income, net, as the managed basis presentation assumes no securitization transactions have occurred. The Company presents U.S. Card Services information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Management also believes that use of a managed basis presentation presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business. Irrespective of the on and off-balance sheet funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant in evaluating the Company's performance and can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The Company does not currently securitize international loans. -13-

A comparatively weaker U.S. dollar resulted in a 2% benefit within the reported worldwide growth rate; - Worldwide total cards in force of 82.2MM increased 10%, up 7.8MM from last year and 2.3MM during 2Q '07, as proprietary and network card growth remained strong; - Worldwide average spending per proprietary basic card in force increased 8% versus last year despite the suppressing effect of substantial card additions over the past few years; - Worldwide lending balances of $48.3B on an owned basis increased 33%; on a managed basis, worldwide lending balances of $68.6B were up 21%; and - Underlying card credit quality continued to be well controlled and reserve coverage ratios remained strong. CAPITAL RETURNED TO SHAREHOLDERS o Including share repurchases and dividends, during 2Q '07 and the six months to-date we returned 81% and 85%, respectively, of capital generated to shareholders. On a cumulative basis, since 1994, we have returned 70% of capital generated. - SHARE REPURCHASES: During 2Q '07, 15MM shares were repurchased versus 16MM shares in 1Q '07 and 23MM shares in 2Q '06. Since the inception of repurchase programs in December 1994, 636MM shares have been acquired under cumulative Board authorizations to repurchase up to 770MM shares, including purchases made under agreements with third parties. -1-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS ADDITIONAL ITEMS OF NOTE o Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services costs increased 9% versus 2Q '06, reflecting the 2Q '06 charge related to the Membership Rewards reserve model outside the U.S., which suppressed the reported growth rate by approximately 5%, higher rewards costs in 2Q '07 and increased marketing and promotion expenses. Marketing expenses continued to reflect the reduced levels of spending discussed in 1Q `07 related to various product-specific advertising, creative development and market research initiatives; however, they also reflect a higher level of spending in 2Q '07 on card acquisition, brand and loyalty oriented programs. The higher rewards costs continued to reflect volume growth, a higher redemption rate, and strong cardmember loyalty program participation. o Total interest expense increased 44%, reflecting increased debt funding levels in support of growth in cardmember receivable and lending balances and a higher effective cost of funds, particularly within our charge card activities. o Total provisions for losses and benefits increased 36% versus 2Q '06, reflecting growth in business volumes and the loan portfolio, as well as increased write-off and delinquency rates versus last year, that have been gradually rising after the unusually low levels that followed the enactment of the October 2005 U.S. bankruptcy legislation. o The 4% increase in human resources expense in 2Q '07 reflects the impact of merit increases and larger benefit and incentive costs, partially offset by lower severance-related costs versus 2Q '06. - Compared with last year, the total employee count of 66,600 increased by 2,700 employees or 4%; compared with last quarter, the employee count increased by 600 employees or 1%. The increase versus last year primarily reflects employee additions related to customer service volumes and initiatives and the acquisition of Harbor Payments, Inc. in 4Q '06. o In conjunction with Delta Air Line's ("Delta") decision to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code during 2005, the Company lent funds to Delta as part of Delta's post-petition, debtor-in-possession financing under the Bankruptcy Code. At March 31, 2007, the remaining principal balance was $115MM. During 2Q '07 Delta received final approval of its reorganization plan and emerged from bankruptcy on April 30, 2007, repaying the entire principal balance outstanding. o During the quarter, the Company announced several management changes which reflect a reorganization of the Company into two distinct customer-focused groups. Effective July 1, Al Kelly was promoted to President of American Express Company, and is responsible for the Global Consumer Group, and Ed Gilligan was promoted to Vice Chairman of American Express Company, and is responsible for the Global Business-to-Business Group. The Company is still reviewing the impact of these changes on its reportable operating segment disclosures, and expects revisions to these disclosures to be reflected within our 3Q '07 financial reports. REVISED SEGMENT AND STATEMENTS OF INCOME PRESENTATION o In 1Q '07, pursuant to the completion of discussions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") referenced in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company made certain modifications to its reportable operating segment disclosures. The Travelers Cheque and Prepaid Services ("TCPS") business, previously included in the U.S. Card Services ("USCS") segment, and international banking businesses, previously included in the International Card & Global Commercial Services ("ICGCS") segment, are now included in the Corporate & Other segment. The discussion and financial data included herein reflect these modifications. o In addition, as described in the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 30, 2007, beginning with 1Q `07, the Company revised the presentation of its Consolidated Statements of Income. The revised Consolidated Statements of Income include the separate presentation of certain interest income and interest expense amounts which previously had been reported on a net basis as well as the separate presentation of the provisions for losses and benefits from expenses. While these revisions impact the presentation of revenues and expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income, they have no impact on the Company's previously reported consolidated pretax income, income taxes, net income, total assets, total liabilities, or total shareholders' equity. o The revised consolidated presentation includes the following: - Gross cardmember lending finance charge revenue is presented in the line entitled "Cardmember lending finance revenue" within the new "Interest income" section of the Consolidated Statements of Income, and the related gross interest expense is presented in the line entitled "Cardmember lending" within the new "Interest expense" section of the Consolidated Statements of Income. These amounts were previously presented on a net basis as "Cardmember lending finance charge revenue, net of interest" within the "Net revenues" section; - Gross investment and other interest income is presented in the lines entitled "International banking" or "Other" within the new "Interest income" section, and gross interest expense related to international banking is presented in "International banking" within the new "Interest expense" section. These amounts were previously presented on a net basis as "Other investment and interest income, net of interest" within the "Net revenues" section; - Other interest expense is presented in the line entitled "Charge card and other" within the new "Interest expense" section, and certain other interest income is presented in the line entitled "Other" within the new "Interest income" section. These amounts were previously reported on a net basis in "Interest" within the "Expenses" section; - "Provisions for losses and benefits" is presented in a new separate section. These amounts were previously reported in the "Provisions for losses and benefits" lines within the "Expenses" section; and - Certain other amounts were revised to conform to the method of presentation or calculation that will be used in 2007. -2-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS o Corresponding revisions to the Selected Income Statement Data presentation regarding the Company's reportable operating segments were also made. o "Total revenues" and "Revenues net of interest expense" are presented separately within the revised Consolidated Statements of Income presentation. "Revenues net of interest expense" is now the measure for the Company's long-term revenue growth rate target. This target (of at least 8 percent growth on average and over time) has not been changed as a result of the revisions to the presentation of the Consolidated Statements of Income. o The changes in the presentation of the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income were also made in connection with the previously mentioned discussions with the staff of the SEC. o Separately, the Company revised the method of reporting certain credit statistics related to the charge card business to better align these metrics with the way the Company manages credit risk as well as to align such credit statistics with the method used for reporting the Company's lending activities. Historically, the credit statistics for the charge card business have been presented using the portion of the account balance that was 90 days past due or more. However, the Company's practices for managing credit risk and establishing reserves for uncollectible amounts consider the entire amounts of customer accounts for those accounts which have any portion that is past due by 90 days or more, and thus certain statistics have been revised to reflect this. Finally, the calculation of net finance revenue divided by average loans for both consolidated reporting and the ICGCS segment has been corrected for a computational error. This correction has a minimal impact on the historic trends for this statistical information. For more detail relating to the changes and a presentation of revised historical financials and statistics, please see the Company's Form 8-K, filed with the SEC March 30, 2007.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED Note: Amounts herein reflect certain revisions as noted on pages 2-3 and in the Company's Form 8-K, filed with the SEC March 30, 2007. # Denotes variance of more than 100%. -5-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED o CONSOLIDATED REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE: Consolidated revenues net of interest expense increased 9%, reflecting increases versus last year of 12% within USCS, 4% within ICGCS and 15% within Global Network & Merchant Services ("GNMS"). Revenues net of interest expense increased due to higher interest income, greater discount revenues, higher other commission and fees, increased other revenues, and greater travel commissions and fees, partially offset by increased interest expense, decreased securitization income, net and lower net card fee revenue. Translation of foreign currency benefited the revenues net of interest expense growth rate by approximately 2%. o CONSOLIDATED EXPENSES: Consolidated expenses increased 7%, reflecting an increase of 11% within USCS, 5% within ICGCS, and 6% within GNMS. Expense growth reflected higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expense, increased other expenses, greater human resources expense, higher professional services expense, increased occupancy and equipment costs and higher communication expenses. Translation of foreign currency contributed approximately 2% to the expense growth rate. o CONSOLIDATED PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES AND BENEFITS: Consolidated provisions for losses and benefits increased 36% versus last year, reflecting an 85% increase in USCS, a 36% decrease in GNMS and a 7% decrease in ICGCS. Provisions rose primarily due to increases in the cardmember lending and charge card provisions. Translation of foreign currency contributed approximately 2% to the provision growth rate. o PRE-TAX MARGIN: Was 20.2% in 2Q '07 compared with 23.9% in 1Q '07 and 22.0% in 2Q '06. o EFFECTIVE TAX RATE: Was 26% in 2Q '07 versus 33% in both 1Q '07 and 2Q '06. The 2Q '07 rate primarily reflects the $65MM IRS benefit, referenced earlier. The 2Q '06 rate reflects a relatively low effective rate on the Brazil gain, which was offset by higher tax expense due to uncertainty regarding the Company's ability to obtain tax benefits for certain expenses attributable to foreign subsidiaries. o DISCOUNT REVENUE: Rose 11% on a 15% increase in billed business. The slower revenue versus billed business growth reflects the relatively faster growth in billed business related to GNS where we share discount revenue with our card issuing partners, and higher cash-back rewards costs. - The average discount rate* was 2.57% in 2Q '07 and in 2Q '06 compared to 2.58% in 1Q '07. As indicated in prior quarters, selective repricing initiatives, continued changes in the mix of business and volume-related pricing discounts will likely result in some erosion of the average discount rate over time. * For additional information about billed business and discount rate calculations, please refer to the Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Release, American Express Company Selected Statistical Information pages. ** Proprietary card activity only. -6-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED - - WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS: The 15% increase in worldwide billed business reflected a 13% increase in USCS, an 11% increase in ICGCS and a 62% increase in GNS partner volume. The table below summarizes selected billed business related statistics for 2Q '07: * Captions not designated as "proprietary" include both proprietary and GNS data. ** Included in USCS. *** Included in ICGCS. - U.S. non-T&E-related volume categories (which represented approximately 68% of 2Q '07 U.S. billed business) grew 15%, while T&E volumes rose 9%. - U.S. airline-related volume, which represented approximately 10% of total U.S. volumes during the quarter, increased 3% due to a 5% increase in transactions offset by a 2% lower average airline charge. - Worldwide airline volumes, which represented approximately 12% of total volumes during the quarter, increased 8% on 6% growth in transactions and a 2% increase in the average airline charge. - Assuming no changes in foreign exchange rates: Total billed business outside the U.S. reflected double-digit proprietary growth in Canada, high single-digit growth in Europe and Asia Pacific and a decline in Latin America. Excluding the impact of the Brazil sale, completed as of 6/30/06, and the 3Q'06 sales in Malaysia and Indonesia, Latin America exhibited double-digit proprietary growth while Asia Pacific increased at a high single-digit rate. Excluding the impact of all three sales, total proprietary growth outside the U.S. was 10%. - - TOTAL CARDS IN FORCE: Rose 10% worldwide due to an increase of 8% in USCS, a 1% increase in ICGCS and a 34% increase in GNS. Continued strong card acquisitions within both proprietary and GNS activities, as well as continued solid average customer retention levels, drove these results. The sale of our card activities in Malaysia and Indonesia in 3Q '06 resulted in the transfer of 200K cards from ICGCS to GNMS, moderately suppressing ICGCS' and increasing GNMS' respective growth rates. -- 1.2MM and 1.1MM net cards were added during the quarter in the U.S. and the non-U.S. businesses, respectively. o NET CARD FEES: Decreased 6% as the benefit of card growth was offset by the reclassification of certain card acquisition-related costs, beginning July 1, 2006, from other operating expense to a reduction in net card fees. This reclassification had no effect on net income and is not included in the average fee per card calculation. The average annual fee per proprietary card in force was $36 in 2Q '07 versus $35 in 1Q '07 and $34 in 2Q '06. o TRAVEL COMMISSIONS AND FEES: Increased 2% reflecting a 9% increase in travel sales. o OTHER COMMISSIONS AND FEES: Increased 6% as higher card-related conversion revenues and assessment and service fees were partially offset by the 2Q '06 sale in Brazil and a reclassification in 3Q '06 of certain third-party merchant-related revenues from Other Commissions and Fees to Discount Revenue. o SECURITIZATION INCOME, NET: Decreased 11% as an increase in write offs and greater interest expense, due to a higher coupon rate paid to certificate holders, was partially offset by a higher portfolio yield and average balance of securitized loans. Securitization income, net represents the non-credit provision components of the gains from securitization activities within the USCS segment, fair value changes and impairment charges, if any, of the related interest-only (I/O) strip, excess spread related to securitized loans, net finance revenue on retained interests in securitized loans, and servicing income, net of related discounts or fees. -7-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED - - Components of Securitization Income, Net: * Excess spread is the net positive cash flow from interest and fee collections allocated to the investor's interests after deducting the interest paid on investor certificates, credit losses, contractual servicing fees, other expenses, and the changes in the fair value of the I/O strip in 2007. ** Excludes $32MM and $(46)MM in 2007 and $35MM and $(47)MM in 2006 of impact from cardmember loan sales and maturities, respectively, reflected in the credit provision. - - The average balance of Cardmember lending securitizations was $20.3B in 2Q '07, compared with $20.1B in 2Q '06. o OTHER REVENUES: Increased 9% primarily due to higher network partner-related and merchant-related fees, and greater publishing and insurance-related revenues. o CARDMEMBER LENDING FINANCE REVENUE: Increased 38% due to 30% growth in average worldwide lending balances on an owned basis and a higher portfolio yield. o INTERNATIONAL BANKING INTEREST INCOME: Increased 12% reflecting higher volumes and interest rates. o OTHER INTEREST INCOME: Increased 41% primarily due to the recognition of interest income associated with the repayment of the Company's loan to Delta Air Lines, previously on non-accrual status. o CARDMEMBER LENDING INTEREST EXPENSE: Increased 56% reflecting increased loan balances and a higher cost of funds. o INTERNATIONAL BANKING INTEREST EXPENSE: Increased 45% reflecting higher volumes and interest rates. o CHARGE CARD AND OTHER INTEREST EXPENSE: Increased 35% reflecting a higher cost of funds and increased receivable balances. o MARKETING, PROMOTION, REWARDS AND CARDMEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES: Increased 9%, reflecting higher volume-related rewards costs and greater marketing and promotion expenses, partially offset by the 2Q '06 charge related to the Membership Rewards reserve model outside of the U.S. o HUMAN RESOURCES EXPENSE: Increased 4% due to merit increases and larger benefit and incentive costs, partially offset by lower severance-related costs. o PROFESSIONAL SERVICES EXPENSE: Rose 6%, primarily reflecting higher technology-related costs and legal fees. o OCCUPANCY AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSE: Rose 4% due to increased technology-related costs. o COMMUNICATIONS EXPENSE: Increased 3%. o OTHER EXPENSE: Increased 20%, however, excluding the $144MM pre-tax gain related to the completion of the sale of our operations in Brazil in 2Q '06, as well as the reclassification of certain card-acquisition costs to card fee revenue beginning July 1, 2006, underlying expenses were relatively flat. -8-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED CHARGE CARD PROVISION FOR LOSSES: Increased 21%, reflecting higher business volumes and somewhat higher loss rates. - - WORLDWIDE CHARGE CARD:* -- The loss ratio increased versus last quarter, but remained flat compared to last year. Past due rates declined versus last quarter and last year. *There are no off-balance sheet Charge Card securitizations. Therefore, all credit quality statistics for the Charge Card portfolio are on an "Owned Basis." Note: Amounts herein reflect certain revisions as noted on pages 2-3 and in the Company's Form 8-K, filed with the SEC March 30, 2007. o CARDMEMBER LENDING PROVISION FOR LOSSES: Increased 57% due to increased loan volumes and higher write-off and delinquency rates, which have been gradually rising after the unusually low rates that followed the October 2005 change in the U.S. bankruptcy legislation. - WORLDWIDE LENDING:* -- The write-off rate was unchanged versus last quarter, but increased versus last year. The past due rate increased versus last year, but decreased versus last quarter. * All lending statistics are presented here on a GAAP or "Owned Basis". "Managed Basis" credit quality statistics are available in the Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Release on the American Express Company Consolidated Selected Statistical Information pages. Credit trends are generally consistent under both reporting methods. o INTERNATIONAL BANKING AND OTHER PROVISION FOR LOSSES AND BENEFITS: Decreased 8% primarily due to lower certificate provisions and a reduction in merchant-related reserves. -9-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY AND TOTAL ADJUSTED ASSETS During the third quarter of 2006, the Company issued $750MM of 6.80% Subordinated Debentures due 2036 ("Subordinated Debentures"), which are automatically extendable until 2066 unless certain events occur prior to that date. In connection with the Subordinated Debentures, the Company has undertaken to disclose on a quarterly basis the amount of its "tangible common equity" and "total adjusted assets". The Company's consolidated tangible common equity amount as of the end of any fiscal quarter means the total shareholders' equity, excluding preferred stock, of the Company as reflected on its consolidated balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP as of such fiscal quarter end minus (i) intangible assets and goodwill and (ii) deferred acquisition costs, as determined in accordance with GAAP and reflected in such consolidated balance sheet. The Company calculates total adjusted assets as of the end of any fiscal quarter as the sum of (i) total consolidated assets as reflected on the Company's balance sheet minus (ii) non-securitized Cardmember lending receivables (without deduction for reserves), which are set forth on the Company's balance sheet, plus (iii) managed (i.e., securitized and non-securitized) worldwide Cardmember lending receivables as reported by the Company for such fiscal quarter. As of June 30, 2007, the Company's tangible common equity was $9B and its total adjusted assets were $155B. As of June 30, 2007, the consolidated assets, as reflected on the Company's balance sheet, were $134B. CORPORATE & OTHER Net expense was $61MM in 2Q '07 compared with net expense of $50MM in 1Q '07 and $49MM in 2Q '06. The 2Q '07 expense includes costs related to regulatory and legal exposures and $2MM ($1MM after-tax) of reengineering costs. The 1Q '07 expense included a $60MM charge for a reserve established for regulatory and legal exposure at American Express Bank International, a subsidiary of American Express Bank Ltd., $4MM ($3MM after-tax) of reengineering costs, and the benefit of a cash payment received in connection with the departure of our former CFO. The 2Q '06 expense included $18MM ($11MM after-tax) of reengineering costs. -10-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW U.S. CARD SERVICES Note: Amounts herein reflect certain revisions, including the movement of the TCPS business results to the Corporate & Other segment, as noted on pages 2-3 and in the Company's Form 8-K, filed with the SEC March 30, 2007. * Proprietary cards only. ** Computed on a trailing 12-month basis using segment income and equity capital allocated to segments based upon specific business operational needs, risk measures and regulatory capital requirements. - BILLED BUSINESS: The 13% increase in USCS billed business reflects a 4% increase in average spending per proprietary basic card and 8% growth in basic cards in force. -- Within the U.S. consumer business, billed business grew 12%; small business volumes rose 15%. - TOTAL CARDS IN FORCE: Increased by 3.0MM, or 8%, versus last year on continued strong card acquisition activity and retention levels. P&L DISCUSSION: o NET INCOME: Decreased 2% as revenues net of interest expense rose 12%, expenses increased 11% and provisions for losses increased 85%. - 2Q '07 results reflect $56MM of the IRS benefit and $47MM ($29MM after-tax) of the increased marketing and promotion spending in the quarter, as referenced earlier. - PRE-TAX MARGIN: Was 23.2% in 2Q '07 versus 30.6% in 1Q '07 and 29.6% in 2Q '06. - EFFECTIVE TAX RATE: Was 30% in 2Q '07 compared to 38% in 1Q '07 and 37% in 2Q '06. The lower tax rate in 2Q '07 reflects the IRS benefit, referenced earlier. o DISCOUNT REVENUE, NET CARD FEES AND OTHER REVENUES: Increased 11%, largely due to greater billed business volumes, higher travel revenues and larger other commissions and fees, in addition to the recognition of interest income associated with the repayment of the Company's loan to Delta Air Lines. -11-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW U.S. CARD SERVICES o CARDMEMBER LENDING FINANCE REVENUE: Increased 45% due to 36% growth in average owned lending balances and a higher portfolio yield. o SECURITIZATION INCOME, NET: Decreased 11% as an increase in write offs and greater interest expense, due to a higher coupon rate paid to certificate holders, was partially offset by a higher portfolio yield and average balance of securitized loans. o CARDMEMBER LENDING INTEREST EXPENSE: Increased 69% on greater loan balances and a higher cost of funds. o CHARGE CARD AND OTHER INTEREST EXPENSE: Increased 22% due to a higher cost of funds and a larger receivable balance. o MARKETING, PROMOTION, REWARDS AND CARDMEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES: Increased 16%, due to higher rewards costs and greater marketing and promotion expenses. o HUMAN RESOURCES AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES: Increased 4% primarily due to higher volume-related operating expenses, which were partially offset by the impact of the reclassification to revenues of certain card acquisition-related costs beginning in 3Q `06. o PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES: Increased 85% reflecting the impact of strong volume and loan growth and higher write off and delinquency rates, which have been gradually rising after the unusually low rates following the enactment of the October 2005 U.S. bankruptcy legislation. - CHARGE CARD: * -- The loss ratio increased versus last year and last quarter. The past due rate increased versus last year, but decreased versus last quarter. Note: Amounts herein reflect certain revisions as noted on pages 2-3 and in the Company's Form 8-K, filed with the SEC March 30, 2007. - CARDMEMBER LENDING: ** -- The write-off rate increased versus last year, but remained flat versus last quarter.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW U.S. CARD SERVICES MANAGED BASIS For USCS, the managed basis presentation assumes that there have been no off-balance sheet securitization transactions, i.e., all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the Company's balance sheets and income statements, respectively. For the managed basis presentation, revenue and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans are reflected in net card fees and other, cardmember lending finance revenue, cardmember lending interest expense and credit provision. On a managed basis, there is no securitization income, net, as the managed basis presentation assumes no securitization transactions have occurred. The Company presents USCS information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Management also believes that use of a managed basis presentation presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business. Irrespective of the on- and off-balance sheet funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant in evaluating the Company's performance and can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The Company does not currently securitize international loans. On a GAAP basis, revenue and expenses from securitized cardmember loans are reflected in the Company's income statements in securitization income, net, fees and commissions, and credit provision for cardmember lending. At the time of a securitization transaction, the securitized cardmember loans are removed from the Company's balance sheet, and the resulting gain on sale is reflected in securitization income, net, as well as an impact to credit provision (credit reserves are no longer recorded for the cardmember loans once sold). Over the life of a securitization transaction, the Company recognizes servicing fees and other net revenues (referred to as "excess spread") related to the interests sold to investors (i.e. the investors' interests). These amounts are reflected in securitization income, net, and fees and commissions. The Company also recognizes cardmember lending finance revenue over the life of the securitization transaction related to the interest it retains (i.e. the seller's interest). At the maturity of a securitization transaction, cardmember loans on the balance sheet increase, and the impact of the incremental required loss reserves is recorded in credit provision. As presented, in aggregate over the life of a securitization transaction, the pretax income impact to the Company is the same whether or not the Company had securitized cardmember loans or funded these loans through other financing activities (assuming the same financing costs). The income statement classifications, however, of specific items will differ. The following information reconciles the GAAP basis presentation for certain USCS income statement line items to the managed basis presentation, where different: Note: Amounts herein reflect certain revisions as noted on pages 2-3 and in the Company's Form 8-K, filed with the SEC March 30, 2007. -13-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW U.S. CARD SERVICES MANAGED P&L DISCUSSION o DISCOUNT REVENUE, NET CARD FEES AND OTHER REVENUES: Increased 12%, largely due to higher billed business volumes, greater other commissions and fees and higher travel commissions and fees. In addition, the increase reflects the recognition of interest income associated with the repayment of the Company's loan to Delta Air Lines. o CARDMEMBER LENDING FINANCE REVENUE: Increased 24% due to 21% growth in average managed lending balances and a higher portfolio yield. o CARDMEMBER LENDING INTEREST EXPENSE: Increased 35% on 21% growth in average managed lending balances and a higher cost of funds. o PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES: Increased 73% due to strong volume and loan growth and higher write-off and delinquency rates, which have been gradually rising after the unusually low rates following the enactment of the October 2005 U.S. bankruptcy legislation. - - CARDMEMBER LENDING: * -- The write-off rate increased versus last year, but was flat compared to last quarter. The past due rate increased versus last year but was lower than last quarter. * Managed basis. There are no off-balance sheet Charge Card securitizations.

STATISTICAL INFORMATION * Proprietary cards only. ** Computed on a trailing 12-month basis using segment income and equity capital allocated to segments based upon specific business operational needs, risk measures and regulatory capital requirements. - - BILLED BUSINESS: The 11% increase in billed business reflects a 15% increase in average spending per proprietary basic card and a 1% increase in basic cards in force. -- Adjusting for the impacts of foreign exchange translation and last year's sales of our operations in Brazil, Malaysia and Indonesia, billed business and spending per proprietary basic card in force increased 10% and 8%, respectively, and all of AXP's major geographic regions experienced high single-digit to low double-digit growth. - International consumer and small business spending rose 7%; global corporate spending rose 12%. - - TOTAL CARDS IN FORCE: Increased by 300K, or 1%, versus last year. Excluding the impact of the 200K proprietary cards in Indonesia and Malaysia transferred to GNMS in 3Q '06, cards in force rose 2%. P&L DISCUSSION o NET INCOME: Increased 22% versus last year as revenues net of interest expense increased 4%, expenses increased 5% and provisions for losses decreased 7%. - 2Q '07 results include $9MM of the IRS benefit and $6MM ($4MM after-tax) of the increased marketing and promotion spending in the quarter, as referenced earlier. -15-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW INTERNATIONAL CARD & GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES - 2Q '06 included: -- A $119MM ($109MM after-tax) gain related to the completion of the sale of our card operations in Brazil; and -- A $62MM ($40MM after-tax) charge associated with certain adjustments made to the Membership Rewards reserve model outside the U.S. - 2Q '07 included $6MM ($4MM after-tax) and 2Q '06 included $34MM ($22MM after-tax) of reengineering costs, related principally to ongoing restructuring activities in the corporate travel business in both periods and the international card business in 2Q '06. - PRE-TAX MARGIN: Was 14.3% in 2Q '07 versus 14.8% in 1Q '07 and 13.9% in 2Q '06. - EFFECTIVE TAX RATE: Was 10% in 2Q '07 versus 20% in 1Q '07 and 21% in 2Q '06. The lower rate in 2Q '07 reflects the IRS benefit, referenced earlier, and additional benefits primarily related to the finalization of certain 2006 tax returns. The 2Q '06 tax rate reflects the relatively low effective rate on the Brazil gain, which was offset by higher tax expense due to uncertainty regarding the Company's ability to obtain tax benefits for certain expenses attributable to foreign subsidiaries. o DISCOUNT REVENUE, NET CARD FEES AND OTHER REVENUES: The increase of 5% versus 2Q '06 was driven primarily by the higher level of card spending, increased other revenues and greater other commissions and fees partially offset by decreased card-related fees due to the reclassification to this revenue category of certain card-related acquisition costs effective July 1, 2006. Growth was also suppressed by the impact of the sales last year of card-related operations in Brazil, Malaysia and Indonesia. o CARDMEMBER LENDING FINANCE REVENUE: Increased 17% on 10% growth in average lending balances and a higher portfolio yield. o CARDMEMBER LENDING INTEREST EXPENSE: Increased 21% on higher loan balances and an increased cost of funds. o CHARGE CARD AND OTHER INTEREST EXPENSE: Increased 34% on higher volumes and a greater cost of funds. o MARKETING, PROMOTION, REWARDS AND CARDMEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES: Decreased 8%, reflecting the 2Q '06 $62MM charge associated with certain adjustments made to the non-U.S. Membership Rewards reserve and lower marketing and promotion costs, partially offset by greater volume-related rewards costs in 2Q `07. o HUMAN RESOURCES AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES: Increased 10%, reflecting last year's Brazil gain and greater human resource expenses in 2Q `07, which were partially offset by the impact of the reclassification to revenues of certain card acquisition-related costs beginning in 3Q '06, and the sales of card operations in Brazil, Malaysia and Indonesia. o PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES: Decreased 7% from a year ago as lower write-off and past due rates, primarily reflecting the 2Q '06 industry-wide credit issues in Taiwan, were partially offset by higher volumes and lending balances. - - CHARGE CARD: * - -- The loss ratio and past due rate decreased versus last year and last quarter. Note: Amounts herein reflect certain revisions as noted on pages 2-3 and in the Company's Form 8-K, filed with the SEC March 30, 2007. - - CARDMEMBER LENDING:* - -- The write-off rate decreased versus last year, but increased versus last quarter.
