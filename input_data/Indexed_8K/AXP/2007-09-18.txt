Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure. On September 18, 2007, American Express Company (the "Company") issued a press release announcing that it has agreed to sell its international banking subsidiary, American Express Bank Ltd. ("AEB"), to Standard Chartered PLC ("Standard Chartered"). A copy of such press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. CERTAIN FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK LTD. & AMERICAN EXPRESS INTERNATIONAL DEPOSIT COMPANY ("AEIDC") BUSINESSES BEING SOLD As of June 30, 2007 --------------- Assets $21.3 billion Equity Value $772 million Year Ended Six Months Ended December 31, 2006 June 30, 2007 ----------------- ---------------- After-tax income (loss) $45 million $(42) million THE AMOUNTS ABOVE WILL NOT BE FULLY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE RESULTS THE COMPANY WILL ULTIMATELY PRESENT AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS DUE TO COSTS RELATED TO CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY ALLOCATIONS THAT WILL REMAIN IN CONTINUING OPERATIONS, AND DUE TO THE TIMING OF THE SALE OF AEIDC AS DISCUSSED IN THE ATTACHED PRESS RELEASE. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS The operations of AEB will be reported by the Company as discontinued operations commencing with the third quarter of 2007. AEIDC will be included in discontinued operations one year prior to its sale to Standard Chartered, which is contracted to occur 18 months following the sale of AEB. All reported historical periods will be restated to reflect the discontinued operations classification. LICENSES FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD AND TRAVEL OPERATIONS No card or travel businesses of the Company are part of the sale to Standard Chartered. In countries where certain card or travel operations are conducted through AEB or one of its subsidiaries, the Company is in the process of acquiring new licenses or transferring the operations to other subsidiaries of the Company. These countries include Argentina, Austria and India. -2-
INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO The underlying portfolio supporting the AEIDC certificate business includes $4.8 billion of investments (not including cash equivalents), of which the majority is invested in mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and corporate obligations. These securities continue to produce the yields and cash flows that were expected at their time of purchase. The $50 million after-tax charge discussed in the attached press release is a result of the AEB transaction and its impact on the Company's strategy with respect to the holding period for certain investments supporting AEB's certificate business. The charge reflects the reduction in value within the AEIDC portfolio attributable to market interest rate movements since the date that the investment securities were purchased. The charges related to the AEIDC investment portfolio discussed above are the result of this transaction's impact on management's investment strategy, which does not extend beyond the AEIDC portfolio. A summary analysis of the Company's investment portfolio by legal entity is as follows at August 31, 2007: The following is a summary of the Company's investment portfolio, including the AEIDC and AEB components, classified as available-for-sale by security type at August 31, 2007: -3-
As a percentage of our total available-for-sale investment portfolio, the market value of the Company's total asset-backed holdings, which includes securities backed by assets other than residential mortgages, remained relatively constant at approximately 19 percent since December 31, 2006. The following is a detailed breakdown of the Company's asset-backed holdings at August 31, 2007: At August 31, 2007, approximately $922 million, or 23 percent of total asset backed holdings were backed by assets other than first-lien residential mortgages, including home equity, auto and student loans as well as commercial mortgages. Of these securities 99 percent were AAA-rated. The $177 million of subprime mortgages represented underlying assets within AAA-rated securities whose cash flows are heavily protected from possible credit problems in the underlying assets. The cash flows the Company receives from these securities exceed the coupon amounts; the excess amount has been retiring principal. -4-
Of the $3.1 billion in securities backed by first residential mortgages: 99 percent were rated AAA and the remaining 1 percent are rated AA. There were no holdings rated below AA backed by residential first mortgages. These securities are valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices. More than 72 percent of the securities backed by first residential mortgages, or $2.2 billion, were primarily guaranteed by three government-sponsored entities: Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. These consisted primarily of pass-through securities in which a mortgage pool's cash flows support one class of securities. A smaller portion involve securities in which a pool supports several classes of structured securities with different cash flow characteristics but identical credit characteristics as all classes are guaranteed by one of the agencies. The net unrealized loss in this portfolio was approximately $50 million as of August 31, 2007 and was due to changes in fixed rates. The remaining non-agency securities backed by residential mortgages consisted of securities in structured transactions, or collateralized mortgage obligations. Of these securities 96 percent are rated AAA; the remaining 4 percent are rated AA. The net unrealized loss in these securities was approximately $20 million as of August 31, 2007.

TO STANDARD CHARTERED PLC. Sale Reflects American Express' Continued Focus on High-Growth, High-Return Payments Businesses NEW YORK, September 18, 2007 - American Express Company today announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell its international banking subsidiary, American Express Bank Ltd. (AEB) to Standard Chartered PLC. The approximate value of the transaction is $1.1 billion. The sale is subject to certain regulatory approvals and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2008. "Today's agreement reflects our strategic focus on the high-growth, high-return payments businesses that have been driving our performance in recent years," said Kenneth I. Chenault, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, American Express Company. "It will also allow AEB to become part of an outstanding financial institution with similar core businesses and strategies." Standard Chartered will pay American Express an amount equal to the net asset value of the AEB businesses that are being sold at the closing date plus $300 million. At June 30, 2007, this would have amounted to approximately $860 million. American Express also expects to realize an additional amount representing the net asset value of American Express International Deposit Company (AEIDC), a subsidiary which issues investment certificates to AEB's customers. As of June 30, 2007, the net asset value of that business was $212 million. This value is expected to be realized through dividends from the subsidiary to American Express and by a subsequent payment from Standard Chartered when the business is transferred to them 18 months after the completion of the sale of AEB. -1-
American Express Bank Ltd. serves financial institutions and high-net-worth customers through its global correspondent banking and full-service private banking businesses operating in 47 countries. The sale will not include any of the Company's card or travel businesses, nor its international financial services businesses that operate separately from AEB. In the aggregate, the transaction is expected to have an approximate break-even impact on the earnings of American Express, although separate components will be recognized in different periods. The first component is an after-tax charge of approximately $50 million in the current quarter related to the agreement and its impact on the Company's strategy with respect to the holding period for certain investments supporting AEIDC. The Company expects to report a net gain in subsequent quarters from the disposition of AEB and other related activities. W. Richard Holmes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, American Express Bank, added, "Once the deal closes, AEB's loyal customer base will gain access to an even broader array of product offerings and our employees will benefit from being part of an organization committed to growing its correspondent and private banking services." American Express Company (www.americanexpress.com) is a leading global payments, network and travel company founded in 1850.
