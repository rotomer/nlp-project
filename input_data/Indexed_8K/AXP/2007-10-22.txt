New York - October 22, 2007 - AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY (NYSE: AXP) today reported third quarter income from continuing operations of $1.1 billion, up 15 percent from $934 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $0.90, up 18 percent from $0.76. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its international banking subsidiary, American Express Bank Ltd.(AEB). Net income, which includes AEB within discontinued operations, totaled $1.1 billion for the quarter, up 10 percent from $967 million a year ago. On a per share basis, net income was $0.90, up 14 percent from $0.79. Consolidated revenues net of interest expense rose 11 percent to $6.9 billion, up from $6.3 billion a year ago. Consolidated expenses totaled $4.5 billion, up 9 percent from $4.2 billion a year ago. The Company's return on equity (ROE) was 38.2 percent. "Our strong earnings growth this quarter reflected a 16 percent rise in combined spending by consumers, small businesses and corporate Cardmembers," said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive. "Investments that expanded our service, rewards and loyalty programs helped to add 2.5 million cards during the quarter while also generating excellent spending increases from existing Cardmembers. "While we continue to be cautious about the overall economy, our ongoing focus on the premium sector and careful management of loan and investment portfolios allowed us to maintain strong credit quality that compares favorably to the industry. "We continued to build on the momentum of recent periods, generating excellent revenue growth and ending the quarter in a strong competitive position." -2-
The third quarter results included a $75 million tax benefit primarily related to the resolution of prior years' tax items. Also included in results was $81 million ($41 million after-tax) of previously disclosed charges primarily related to the contracted sale of American Express International Deposit Company (AEIDC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company which issues investment certificates to AEB's customers. The year-ago quarter results included a $33 million ($24 million after-tax) gain related to the sale of the Company's card operations in Malaysia and Indonesia. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Discontinued operations included a loss of $7 million primarily reflecting the results of AEB. In the year-ago period, discontinued operations included income of $33 million. SEGMENT RESULTS As previously announced, the Company reorganized its businesses into two customer-focused groups - the Global Consumer Group and the Global Business-to-Business Group. The Company will continue to report the U.S. Card Services segment and Global Network & Merchant Services segments consistent with previous reporting. The previously reported International Card & Global Commercial Services segment will now be reported as two separate segments: the International Card Services segment and the Global Commercial Services segment. The Company's U.S. Card Services and International Card Services segments are aligned with the Global Consumer Group and the Company's Global Network & Merchant Services and Global Commercial Services segments are aligned with the Global Business-to-Business Group. In addition, beginning with the third quarter of 2007, and for all prior periods, AEB results have been removed from the Corporate & Other segment and reported within the discontinued operations line on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. In addition to the agreement to sell AEB to Standard Chartered PLC, AEIDC was also contracted to be sold to Standard Chartered 18 months after the close of the AEB sale through a put/call agreement. AEIDC will continue to be reflected in continuing operations within the Corporate & Other segment until one year before the anticipated close of this portion of the transaction. Based on the assumed completion of the AEB sale in the first quarter of 2008, we expect to begin reporting AEIDC's results in the discontinued operations line in the third quarter of 2008. The following segment discussion, as well as the selected financial data for all periods presented, reflect the changes noted above. -3-
U.S. CARD SERVICES reported third quarter net income of $592 million, up 6 percent from $558 million a year ago. Revenues net of interest expense for the third quarter increased 12 percent to $3.6 billion, reflecting higher spending and borrowing by consumers and small businesses, which were partially offset by higher interest expense. Total expenses increased 6 percent. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses increased 7 percent from the year-ago period primarily due to higher rewards costs partially offset by a targeted decrease in marketing and promotion expenses. Human resources and other operating expenses increased 5 percent. Strong growth in loans outstanding, along with write-off and delinquency rates returning to levels more consistent with historical rates from the unusually low levels of a year ago, resulted in a 44 percent increase in provisions for losses. Results for the third quarter included $18 million of the previously mentioned tax benefit. INTERNATIONAL CARD SERVICES reported third quarter net income of $140 million, up 32 percent from $106 million a year ago. Revenues net of interest expense increased 17 percent to $1.1 billion, reflecting higher Cardmember spending, as well as higher loan balances. Total expenses increased 27 percent. Human resources and other operating expenses increased 17 percent from a year ago when these expenses included a gain related to the sale of the Company's card operations in Malaysia and Indonesia. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses increased 43 percent due to an increase in rewards and higher marketing promotion costs. Provisions for losses were unchanged from a year ago as growth in the loan portfolio was offset by a lower level of write off and delinquency rates. Results for the third quarter included $17 million of the previously mentioned tax benefit and certain consolidated tax benefits arising from this segment's ongoing non-U.S. funding activities. GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES reported third quarter net income of $135 million, up 29 percent from $105 million a year ago. Revenues net of interest expense increased 12 percent to $1.1 billion, reflecting higher spending by corporate Cardmembers. Total expenses increased 10 percent. Human resources and other operating expenses increased 10 percent reflecting continued growth in the business. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses increased 8 percent. Provisions for losses increased 24 percent from year-ago levels, primarily reflecting higher volumes. Results for the third quarter included $9 million of the previously mentioned tax benefit. -4-
GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES reported third quarter net income of $266 million, up 25 percent from $212 million a year ago. Revenues net of interest expense for the third quarter increased 17 percent to $980 million. The increase reflected continued strong growth in merchant-related revenue primarily from higher company-wide billed business. Spending on Global Network Services cards increased 45 percent from year-ago levels reflecting continued growth in spending on cards issued by bank partners. Cards-in-force issued by bank partners increased 32 percent. Total expenses increased 12 percent, reflecting higher human resources costs and expanded marketing and promotion activities. Results for the third quarter included $22 million of the previously mentioned tax benefit. CORPORATE AND OTHER reported third quarter net expenses of $59 million, compared with net expenses of $47 million a year ago. The increase was primarily due to the previously mentioned charges at AEIDC. *** -5-

(Preliminary) U.S. CARD SERVICES SELECTED INCOME STATEMENT DATA (Millions) -12-
(Preliminary) U.S. CARD SERVICES SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION MANAGED BASIS PRESENTATION (Millions) For U.S. Card Services, the managed basis presentation assumes that there have been no off-balance sheet securitization transactions, i.e., all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the Company's balance sheets and income statements, respectively. For the managed basis presentation, revenue and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans are reflected in other commissions and fees (included above in discount revenue, net card fees and other), cardmember lending finance revenue, cardmember lending interest expense, and provisions for losses. On a managed basis, there is no securitization income, net, as the managed basis presentation assumes no securitization transactions have occurred. The Company presents U.S. Card Services information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Management also believes that use of a managed basis presentation presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business. Irrespective of the on and off-balance sheet funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant in evaluating the Company's performance and can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The Company does not currently securitize international loans. -13-

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS FINANCIAL RESULTS o Third quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.90 increased 18% versus $0.76 last year. Revenues net of interest expense rose 11%. For the trailing 12 months, return on equity (ROE) was 38%. - 3Q '07 Income from continuing operations included: -- An $81MM ($41MM after-tax) charge related to mark-to-market adjustments and sales within the American Express International Deposit Company ("AEIDC") investment portfolio resulting from the announced sale during the quarter of American Express Bank, Ltd. ("AEB") to Standard Chartered PLC ("Standard Chartered"), as referenced further on page 2; and -- A $75MM tax benefit, primarily related to the resolution of prior years' tax items. - 3Q '06 Income from continuing operations included a $33MM ($24MM after-tax) gain on the sales of card-related operations in Malaysia and Indonesia. - 3Q '07 and 3Q '06 Income from continuing operations included $10MM ($7MM after-tax) and $11MM ($7MM after-tax), respectively, of reengineering costs related to restructuring efforts primarily within our corporate travel business. - The DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS line in the Consolidated Financial Statements contains the results, assets and liabilities related to various business sales. In addition to AEB, referenced above, discontinued operations also reflects the results from the international banking operations in Brazil, sold in 2Q'06, Tax and Business Services ("TBS"), sold in 3Q '05, and Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (formerly American Express Financial Advisors), for which the distribution of all outstanding shares was made on September 30, 2005. -- 3Q '07 results reflected $7MM of losses from discontinued operations, related to AEB's results which include substantial compliance-related remediation costs, as well as the TBS business, versus $33MM of income last year. -- Including discontinued operations, diluted EPS on a net income basis of $0.90 increased 14% versus last year. BUSINESS METRICS o Compared with the third quarter of 2006: - Worldwide billed business of $162.5B increased 16% on continued strong growth within both the proprietary and network businesses. A comparatively weaker U.S. dollar resulted in a 2% benefit within the reported worldwide growth rate. - Worldwide total cards in force of 84.7MM increased 11%, up 8.2MM from last year and 2.5MM during 3Q '07, as proprietary and network card growth remained strong. - Worldwide average spending per proprietary basic card in force increased 8% versus last year despite the suppressing effect of substantial card additions over the past few years. - Worldwide lending balances of $50.5B on an owned basis increased 32%; on a managed basis, worldwide lending balances of $72.0B were up 23%. - Underlying card credit quality continued to be well controlled and reserve coverage ratios remained strong. CAPITAL RETURNED TO SHAREHOLDERS o Including share repurchases and dividends, during 3Q '07 and the nine months to-date we returned 84% and 85%, respectively, of capital generated to shareholders. On a cumulative basis, since 1994, we have returned 70% of capital generated. - SHARE REPURCHASES: During both 3Q '07 and 2Q '07, 15MM shares were repurchased versus 16MM shares in 3Q '06. Since the inception of repurchase programs in December 1994, 652MM shares have been acquired under cumulative Board authorizations to repurchase up to 770MM shares, including purchases made under agreements with third parties. -1-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS ADDITIONAL ITEMS OF NOTE o Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses increased 14% versus 3Q '06, reflecting higher rewards costs in 3Q '07 and increased marketing and promotion expenses. The higher rewards costs continued to reflect volume growth, a higher redemption rate, and strong cardmember program participation. Marketing expenses continued to reflect card acquisition, brand and loyalty oriented programs, with an increased emphasis on our non-U.S. activities. o Total interest expense increased 39%, reflecting increased debt funding levels in support of growth in cardmember receivable and lending balances and a higher effective cost of funds. o Total provisions for losses and benefits increased 25% versus 3Q '06, reflecting growth in business volumes and the loan portfolio, as well as increased write-off and delinquency rates within the U.S. versus last year, which have risen from the unusually low levels during 2006 following the enactment of the October 2005 bankruptcy legislation. o The 11% increase in human resources expense in 3Q '07 reflects the impact of a higher level of employees, merit increases and larger benefit costs. - Compared with last year, the total employee count of 65,100 increased by 3,800 employees or 6%; compared with last quarter, the employee count increased by 1,200 employees or 2%. The increases primarily reflect employee additions related to customer service volumes and initiatives and the acquisition of Harbor Payments, Inc. in 4Q '06 and Farrington American Express Travel Services Ltd. ("FAE Travel") in 3Q '07. o During 3Q '07, the Company announced that it entered into an agreement to sell its international banking subsidiary, AEB, to Standard Chartered, reflecting the Company's strategic focus on the high-growth, high-return payments businesses that have driven its recent performance. The approximate value of the transaction is $1.1B. The sale is subject to certain regulatory approvals and is expected to be completed in 1Q '08. Standard Chartered will pay the Company an amount equal to the net asset value of the AEB businesses that are being sold at the closing date plus $300MM. At September 30, 2007, this would have amounted to approximately $825MM. The Company also expects to realize an additional amount representing the net asset value of AEIDC, a subsidiary which issues investment certificates to AEB customers. The contracted sale of AEIDC will occur through a put/call agreement. As of September 30, 2007, the net asset value of that business was $262MM. This value is expected to be realized through dividends from the subsidiary to American Express and by a subsequent payment from Standard Chartered when the business is transferred to them eighteen months after the completion of the sale of AEB. In aggregate, the transaction is expected to have an approximate break-even impact on the Company's earnings, although separate components will be recognized in different periods, such as the AEIDC charge referenced above. As a result of the agreement, beginning with 3Q '07, and for all prior periods, AEB results, assets and liabilities have been removed from the Corporate & Other segment and reported within Discontinued Operations on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. AEIDC will continue to be reflected in continuing operations within the Corporate & Other segment until one year before the anticipated close of this portion of the transaction. Assuming completion of the AEB sale in 1Q '08, AEIDC will be reported in discontinued operations beginning in 3Q '08. The previously mentioned $81MM ($41MM) after-tax charge related to AEIDC is included in the 3Q '07 results from continuing operations within the "Other revenues" line. The charge relates to the AEIDC investment portfolio and results from the AEB sale agreement's impact on the holding period for the investments. It principally reflects the reduction in value within the AEIDC investment portfolio attributable to market interest rate movements since the date that the investment securities were purchased. The reclassification of the portfolio from its previous available-for-sale status to its current trading status requires the Company to report changes in the market value of AEIDC's investment portfolio within the income statement until AEIDC is sold. The Company expects to report a net gain in subsequent quarters from the disposition of AEB and other related activities. o Within the Consolidated Statements of Income, the Company has reclassified certain prior period amounts from professional services and occupancy and equipment expense to human resources and other expense, in order to conform to its current presentation. This reclassification has no impact on total expenses, pre-tax income, or net income. Additionally, the historical trends of these financial statement line items remain consistent after the reclassification. REVISED SEGMENT AND STATEMENTS OF INCOME PRESENTATION o The Company instituted organizational changes effective July 1, 2007 which reflect a reorganization of the Company into two distinct customer-focused groups: the Global Consumer Group and the Global Business-to-Business Group. The impact of these changes on the Company's reportable operating segment disclosures is as follows: - The Company continues to report the U.S. Card Services ("USCS") segment and the Global Network & Merchant Services ("GNMS") segment consistent with previous reporting. - The previously reported International Card & Global Commercial Services segment is now reported as two separate segments: the International Card Services ("ICS") segment and the Global Commercial Services ("GCS") segment. - The U.S. Card Services and International Card Services segments are aligned with the Global Consumer Group, and the Global Network & Merchant Services and Global Commercial Services segments are aligned with the Global Business-to-Business Group. o In addition, as described in the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 30, 2007, beginning with 1Q '07, the Company revised the presentation of its Consolidated Statements of Income. The revised Consolidated Statements of Income include the separate presentation of certain interest income and interest expense amounts which previously had been reported on a net basis, and the separate presentation of the provisions for losses and benefits from expenses. While these revisions impact the presentation of revenues and expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income, -2-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS they have no impact on the Company's previously reported consolidated pretax income, income taxes, net income, total assets, total liabilities, or total shareholders' equity. o In addition, in 1Q '07 the Travelers Cheque and Prepaid Services ("TCPS") business, previously included in the USCS segment, was moved to the Corporate & Other segment. o In conjunction with the previously discussed AEB sale, the Company further revised its presentation of its Consolidated Statements of Income. Prior to the sale, the Consolidated Statements of Income reflected interest income and expense from AEB's international banking activities on the "International banking interest income" and "International banking interest expense" lines. The revised presentation contained herein no longer includes these lines, as the majority of the revenues and expenses from international banking have been moved to Discontinued Operations. o "Total revenues" and "Revenues net of interest expense" are presented separately within the revised Consolidated Statements of Income presentation. "Revenues net of interest expense" is now the measure for the Company's long-term revenue growth rate target. This target (of at least 8 percent growth on average and over time) has not been changed as a result of the revisions to the presentation of the Consolidated Statements of Income. o The revised consolidated presentation now includes the following: - Gross cardmember lending finance charge revenue is presented in the line entitled "Cardmember lending finance revenue" within the new "Interest income" section of the Consolidated Statements of Income, and the related gross interest expense is presented in the line entitled "Cardmember lending" within the new "Interest expense" section of the Consolidated Statements of Income. These amounts were previously presented on a net basis as "Cardmember lending finance charge revenue, net of interest" within the "Net revenues" section. - Gross investment and other interest income are presented in the line entitled "Other (including investment certificates)" within the new "Interest income" section. These amounts were previously presented on a net basis as "Other investment and interest income, net of interest" within the "Net revenues" section. - Other interest expense is presented in the line entitled "Charge card and other" within the new "Interest expense" section, and certain other interest income is presented in the line entitled "Other (including investment certificates)" within the new "Interest income" section. These amounts were previously reported on a net basis in "Interest" within the "Expenses" section. - "Provisions for losses and benefits" is presented in a new separate section. These amounts were previously reported in the "Provisions for losses and benefits" lines within the "Expenses" section. The line under Provisions for Losses and Benefits that used to be called "International banking and other (including investment certificates)" is now called "Other (including investment certificates)." - Certain other amounts were revised to conform to the method of presentation or calculation that is being used in 2007. o Corresponding revisions to the Selected Income Statement Data presentation regarding the Company's reportable operating segments were also made. o Separately, in 1Q '07 the Company revised the method of reporting certain credit statistics related to the charge card business to better align these metrics with the way the Company manages credit risk as well as to align such credit statistics with the method used for reporting the Company's lending activities. Historically, the credit statistics for the charge card business have been presented using the portion of the account balance that was 90 days past due or more. However, the Company's practices for managing credit risk and establishing reserves for uncollectible amounts consider the entire amounts of customer accounts for those accounts which have any portion that is past due by 90 days or more, and thus certain statistics have been revised to reflect this. Finally, the calculation of net finance revenue divided by average loans for both consolidated reporting and the ICS segment has been corrected for a computational error. This correction has a minimal impact on the historic trends for this statistical information. EXPANDED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES o During the quarter, American Express continued to invest in growth opportunities through expanded products and services. In our proprietary issuing and network business we: - Announced two new agent bank agreements with Harris and BankAtlantic, allowing the distribution of our OPEN from American Express(R) small business charge and credit products in Chicago and Florida, respectively.

The funds will be used to provide millions of children in the developing world with safe drinking water. This initiative was part of American Express' "Are You a Cardmember" campaign which also highlights the value of being part of the American Express community. In our Global Network Services ("GNS") business we: - Announced a new card issuing partnership and launched our first product with China CITIC Bank. The CITIC American Express Card will be available in both Classic and Gold versions, will be denominated in both Reminbi and US dollar currencies, and offers a strong value proposition especially in the areas of travel rewards and benefits. - Announced the first card issuing partnership with GE Consumer Finance (a Japanese subsidiary of GE Money, a unit of General Electric Company) to issue American Express-branded credit cards in Japan.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED Note: Amounts herein reflect certain revisions, as noted on pages 2-3. # Denotes variance of more than 100%. -5-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED o CONSOLIDATED REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE: Consolidated revenues net of interest expense increased 11%, reflecting increases versus last year of 12% within USCS, 17% within ICS, 12% within GCS and 17% within GNMS. Revenues net of interest expense increased due to greater discount revenues, larger interest income, higher other commission and fees, increased net card fees, greater travel commissions and fees, and higher securitization income net, partially offset by increased interest expense and lower other revenues. Translation of foreign currency benefited the revenues net of interest expense growth rate by approximately 2%. o CONSOLIDATED EXPENSES: Consolidated expenses increased 9%, reflecting an increase of 6% within USCS, 27% within ICS, 10% within GCS and 12% within GNMS. Expense growth reflected higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expense, greater human resources expense, increased occupancy and equipment costs, higher communication expenses, and larger other expenses, partially offset by lower professional services expenses. Translation of foreign currency contributed approximately 2% to the expense growth rate. o CONSOLIDATED PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES AND BENEFITS: Consolidated provisions for losses and benefits increased 25% versus last year, reflecting a 44% increase in USCS, a 24% increase in GCS, a 21% increase in GNMS, and a flat provision level in ICS. Provisions rose primarily due to increases in the cardmember lending and charge card provisions. Translation of foreign currency contributed approximately 2% to the provision growth rate. o PRE-TAX MARGIN: Was 20.4% in 3Q '07 compared with 20.3% in 2Q '07 and 20.9% in 3Q '06. o EFFECTIVE TAX RATE: Was 24% in 3Q '07 versus 26% in 2Q '07 and 29% in 3Q '06. The 3Q '07 rate reflects $75MM in tax benefits principally related to the resolution of prior years' tax items. The 2Q '07 rate primarily reflects a $65MM IRS benefit related to the treatment of prior years' card fee income. The 3Q '06 rate reflects the favorable impacts of a net interest receivable from the IRS, finalization of the 2005 U.S. Federal tax return and an adjustment of 2006 estimated state taxes. o DISCOUNT REVENUE: Rose 12% on a 16% increase in billed business. The slower revenue versus billed business growth reflects the relatively faster growth in billed business related to GNS, where we share discount revenue with our card issuing partners, and higher cash-back rewards costs and corporate incentive payments. - The average discount rate* was 2.57% in 3Q '07, 2Q '07 and 3Q '06. As indicated in prior quarters, selective repricing initiatives, continued changes in the mix of business and volume-related pricing discounts will likely result in some erosion of the average discount rate over time. * For additional information about billed business and discount rate calculations, please refer to the Third Quarter 2007 Earnings Release, American Express Company Selected Statistical Information pages. ** Proprietary card activity only. -6-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED - - WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS: The 16% increase in worldwide billed business reflected a 13% increase in USCS, a 15% increase in ICS, a 14% increase in GCS and a 45% increase in GNS partner volume. The table below summarizes selected billed business related statistics for 3Q '07: * Captions not designated as "proprietary" include both proprietary and GNS data. ** Included in USCS. *** Included in GCS. **** Included in ICS. -- U.S. non-T&E-related volume categories (which represented approximately 68% of 3Q '07 U.S. billed business) grew 15%, while T&E volumes rose 10%. -- U.S. airline-related volume, which represented approximately 9% of total U.S. volumes during the quarter, increased 5% due to a 5% increase in transactions and a slightly higher average airline charge. -- Worldwide airline volumes, which represented approximately 11% of total volumes during the quarter, increased 13% on 8% growth in transactions and a 5% increase in the average airline charge. -- Assuming no changes in foreign exchange rates: Total billed business outside the U.S. reflected proprietary growth in Europe and Latin America in the low double-digits and growth in Canada and Asia Pacific in the high single-digits. - TOTAL CARDS IN FORCE: Rose 11% worldwide due to an increase of 8% in USCS, a 2% increase in ICS, a 3% increase in GCS and a 32% increase in GNS. Continued strong card acquisitions within both proprietary and GNS activities, as well as continued solid average customer retention levels, drove these results. -- 1.2MM and 1.3MM net cards were added during the quarter in the U.S. and the non-U.S. businesses, respectively. o NET CARD FEES: Increased 13% due to the benefit of card growth and a higher average card fee. The average annual fee per proprietary card in force was $36 in 3Q '07 and 2Q '07 versus $34 in 3Q '06. o TRAVEL COMMISSIONS AND FEES: Increased 13% reflecting a 16% increase in worldwide travel sales. o OTHER COMMISSIONS AND FEES: Rose 19% on higher card-related conversion revenues and greater assessment and service fees. o SECURITIZATION INCOME, NET: Increased 2% as higher gains from issuances and a greater average balance of securitized loans was partially offset by an increase in write offs and greater interest expense, due to a higher coupon rate paid to certificate holders. Securitization income, net represents the non-credit provision components of the gains from securitization activities within the USCS segment, fair value changes of the related interest-only (I/O) strip, excess spread related to securitized loans, net finance revenue on retained interests in securitized loans, and servicing income, net of related discounts or fees. -7-

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED CHARGE CARD PROVISION FOR LOSSES: Increased 9%, primarily reflecting higher business volumes. - - WORLDWIDE CHARGE CARD:* -- The loss ratio and past due rate increased versus last quarter, but remained flat compared to last year. *There are no off-balance sheet Charge Card securitizations. Therefore, all credit quality statistics for the Charge Card portfolio are on an "Owned Basis." Note: Amounts herein reflect certain revisions, as noted on pages 2-3. o CARDMEMBER LENDING PROVISION FOR LOSSES: Increased 41% due to increased loan volumes and higher write-off and delinquency rates within the U.S., which have risen after the unusually low rates in 2006 that followed the October 2005 change in the bankruptcy legislation. - - WORLDWIDE LENDING:* -- The write-off rate was unchanged versus last quarter, but increased versus last year. The past due rate increased versus last year and last quarter. * All lending statistics are presented here on a GAAP or "Owned Basis".

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY AND TOTAL ADJUSTED ASSETS During the third quarter of 2006, the Company issued $750MM of 6.80% Subordinated Debentures due 2036 ("Subordinated Debentures"), which are automatically extendable until 2066 unless certain events occur prior to that date. In connection with the Subordinated Debentures, the Company has undertaken to disclose on a quarterly basis the amount of its "tangible common equity" and "total adjusted assets". The Company's consolidated tangible common equity amount as of the end of any fiscal quarter means the total shareholders' equity, excluding preferred stock, of the Company as reflected on its consolidated balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP as of such fiscal quarter end minus (i) intangible assets and goodwill and (ii) deferred acquisition costs, as determined in accordance with GAAP and reflected in such consolidated balance sheet. The Company calculates total adjusted assets as of the end of any fiscal quarter as the sum of (i) total consolidated assets as reflected on the Company's balance sheet minus (ii) non-securitized Cardmember lending receivables (without deduction for reserves), which are set forth on the Company's balance sheet, plus (iii) managed (i.e., securitized and non-securitized) worldwide Cardmember lending receivables as reported by the Company for such fiscal quarter. As of September 30, 2007, the Company's tangible common equity was $9B and its total adjusted assets were $162B. As of September 30, 2007, the consolidated assets, as reflected on the Company's balance sheet, were $141B. CORPORATE & OTHER Net expense was $59MM in 3Q '07 compared with net expense of $85MM in 2Q '07 and $47MM in 3Q '06. The 3Q '07 expense includes the previously mentioned $41MM after-tax AEIDC charge. The 2Q '07 expense includes costs related to regulatory and legal exposures and $2MM ($1MM after-tax) of reengineering costs. -10-

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW U.S. CARD SERVICES o SECURITIZATION INCOME, NET: Increased 2% as higher gains from issuances and a greater average balance of securitized loans were partially offset by an increase in write offs and greater interest expense, due to a higher coupon rate paid to certificate holders. o CARDMEMBER LENDING INTEREST EXPENSE: Increased 55% on greater loan balances and a higher cost of funds. o CHARGE CARD AND OTHER INTEREST EXPENSE: Increased 24% due to a higher cost of funds and a larger receivable balance. o MARKETING, PROMOTION, REWARDS AND CARDMEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES: Increased 7%, due to higher volume-driven rewards costs which were partially offset by lower marketing and promotion expenses. o HUMAN RESOURCES AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES: Increased 5% primarily due to higher technology and volume-related operating expenses. o PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES: Increased 44% reflecting the impact of strong loan and volume growth and higher write-off and delinquency rates, which have risen after the unusually low rates following the enactment of the October 2005 U.S. bankruptcy legislation. - CHARGE CARD: * -- The loss ratio and past due rates increased versus last year and last quarter.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW U.S. CARD SERVICES MANAGED BASIS For USCS, the managed basis presentation assumes that there have been no off-balance sheet securitization transactions, i.e., all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the Company's balance sheets and income statements, respectively. For the managed basis presentation, revenue and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans are reflected in net card fees and other, cardmember lending finance revenue, cardmember lending interest expense and credit provision. On a managed basis, there is no securitization income, net, as the managed basis presentation assumes no securitization transactions have occurred. The Company presents USCS information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Management also believes that use of a managed basis presentation presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business. Irrespective of the on- and off-balance sheet funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant in evaluating the Company's performance and can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The Company does not currently securitize international loans. On a GAAP basis, revenue and expenses from securitized cardmember loans are reflected in the Company's income statements in securitization income, net, fees and commissions, and credit provision for cardmember lending. At the time of a securitization transaction, the securitized cardmember loans are removed from the Company's balance sheet, and the resulting gain on sale is reflected in securitization income, net, as well as an impact to credit provision (credit reserves are no longer recorded for the cardmember loans once sold). Over the life of a securitization transaction, the Company recognizes servicing fees and other net revenues (referred to as "excess spread") related to the interests sold to investors (i.e. the investors' interests). These amounts are reflected in securitization income, net, and fees and commissions. The Company also recognizes cardmember lending finance revenue over the life of the securitization transaction related to the interest it retains (i.e. the seller's interest). At the maturity of a securitization transaction, cardmember loans on the balance sheet increase, and the impact of the incremental required loss reserves is recorded in credit provision. As presented, in aggregate over the life of a securitization transaction, the pretax income impact to the Company is the same whether or not the Company had securitized cardmember loans or funded these loans through other financing activities (assuming the same financing costs). The income statement classifications, however, of specific items will differ. The following information reconciles the GAAP basis presentation for certain USCS income statement line items to the managed basis presentation, where different: Note: Amounts herein reflect certain revisions, as noted on pages 2-3. -13-
MANAGED P&L DISCUSSION o DISCOUNT REVENUE, NET CARD FEES AND OTHER REVENUES: Increased 12%, largely due to higher billed business volumes, greater other commissions and fees, increased net card fees, and higher travel revenues. o CARDMEMBER LENDING FINANCE REVENUE: Increased 22% due to 23% growth in average managed lending balances and a slightly lower portfolio yield. o CARDMEMBER LENDING INTEREST EXPENSE: Increased 32% on growth in lending balances and a higher cost of funds. o PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES: Increased 47% reflecting the impact of strong loan and volume growth and higher write-off and delinquency rates, which have risen after the unusually low rates following the enactment of the October 2005 U.S. bankruptcy legislation. - CARDMEMBER LENDING: * -- The write-off rate increased versus last year, but remained flat versus last quarter. The past due rate increased versus last year and last quarter, but remained well within historical ranges. * Managed basis. There are no off-balance sheet Charge Card securitizations.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW INTERNATIONAL CARD SERVICES CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (GAAP BASIS) (Preliminary) Note: Amounts herein reflect certain revisions, as noted on pages 2-3. # Denotes variance of more than 100%. STATISTICAL INFORMATION * Proprietary cards only. ** Segment capital includes an allocation attributable to goodwill of $520MM and $517MM in 3Q '07 and 3Q '06, respectively. Return on segment capital is computed on a trailing 12-month basis using segment income and equity capital allocated to segments based upon specific business operational needs, risk measures and regulatory capital requirements. - - BILLED BUSINESS: The 15% increase in billed business reflects a 16% increase in average spending per proprietary basic card and a 1% increase in basic cards in force. - -- Adjusting for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, billed business and spending per proprietary basic card in force increased 7% and 8%, respectively, and volume growth within the major geographic regions ranged from growth in the mid single-digits to the low double-digits. - - TOTAL CARDS IN FORCE: Increased by 300K, or 2%, versus last year. P&L DISCUSSION o NET INCOME: Increased 32% versus last year as revenues net of interest expense increased 17%, expenses rose by 27% and provisions for losses was unchanged. Both revenue and expense growth rates were inflated by the translation of foreign currency. - - 3Q '06 expenses included a $23MM ($17MM after-tax) gain related to the completion of the sale of the Company's card operations in Malaysia and Indonesia. - - PRE-TAX MARGIN: Was 9.9% in 3Q '07 versus 8.8% in 2Q '07 and 12.7% in 3Q '06. - - EFFECTIVE TAX RATE: Was (27%) in both 3Q '07 and 2Q '07, respectively, versus 12% in 3Q '06. Going forward, this segment will likely reflect an overall tax benefit since our internal tax allocation process provides ICS with the consolidated benefit related to its ongoing funding activities outside the U.S. In addition to that recurring benefit, the 3Q '07 tax rate includes $17MM of the previously mentioned tax benefits, while the 2Q '07 rate includes several small favorable items primarily related to the finalization of prior year's tax returns and settlements with tax authorities. The 3Q '06 rate reflects the relatively low tax benefit associated with credit losses in Taiwan and the overall impact of ICS' global mix of earnings. -15-
