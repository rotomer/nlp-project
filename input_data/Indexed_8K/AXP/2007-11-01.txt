Item 7.01       Regulation FD Disclosure
 
The following information is furnished under Item 7.01  Regulation FD Disclosure:
 
As previously announced in the American Express Company (the "Company") Form 8-K dated October 22, 2007, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company reorganized its businesses into two customer-focused groups  the Global Consumer Group and the Global Business-to-Business Group. Taking into consideration these organization changes, the Company will continue to report the U.S. Card Services ("USCS") segment and Global Network & Merchant Services ("GNMS") segment consistent with previous reporting. However, the previously reported International Card & Global Commercial Services segment is now being reported as two separate segments: the International Card Services ("ICS") segment and the Global Commercial Services ("GCS") segment. The Company's U.S. Card Services and International Card Services segments are aligned with the Global Consumer Group and the Company's Global Network & Merchant Services and Global Commercial Services segments are aligned with the Global Business-to-Business Group.
 
Beginning with the third quarter of 2007, and for all prior periods, the results of American Express Bank Ltd. ("AEB") (except for certain components of AEB that are not being sold) have been removed from the Corporate & Other segment and reclassified to the discontinued operations line on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.
 
Also, beginning with the third quarter of 2007, and for all prior periods, the Company has reclassified certain prior period amounts within the Consolidated Statements of Income from professional services and occupancy and equipment expense to human resources and other expense to conform to its current presentation.
 
Except for discontinued operations, these items had no impact on the Company's consolidated pretax income from continuing operations, income tax provision, and income from continuing operations. None of these items had an impact on the Company's net income.
 
Financial and other information reflecting the reorganization of the Company's reportable operating segments, the reclassification of AEB as a discontinued operation, and reclassifications of other operating expenses is furnished in Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.
 
The changes discussed above are incremental to previous revisions included in the Form 8-K dated March 30, 2007.
 
EXHIBIT
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

principles (GAAP), unless otherwise indicated. Segment disclosures have been revised to reflect the Company's organizational changes that became effective July 1, 2007. In addition, amounts herein reflect certain modifications made to the Company's reportable operating segment disclosures as noted in the Company's Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2007, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Amounts have also been revised to reflect American Express Bank Ltd. (AEB) activities as discontinued operations and to remove AEB (except for certain components of AEB that are not being sold) from the Corporate & Other segment.

For U.S. Card Services, the managed basis presentation assumes that there have been no off-balance sheet securitization transactions, i.e., all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the Company's balance sheets and income statements, respectively. For the managed basis presentation, revenue and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans are reflected in other commissions and fees (included above in discount revenue, net card fees and other), cardmember lending finance revenue, cardmember lending interest expense, and provisions for losses. On a managed basis, there is no securitization income, net, as the managed basis presentation assumes no securitization transactions have occurred.
 
The Company presents U.S. Card Services information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Management also believes that use of a managed basis presentation presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business. Irrespective of the on and off-balance sheet funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant in evaluating the Company's performance and can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis.  The Company does not currently securitize international loans.
