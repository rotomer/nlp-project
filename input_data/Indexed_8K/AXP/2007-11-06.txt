Henry as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of American Express Company (the "Company"). Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers (c) In connection with Mr. Henry's appointment, on October 31, 2007, the Compensation and Benefits Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Company approved an increase of Mr. Henry's base salary from $370,000 per annum to $625,000 per annum retroactive to October 15, 2007. Also in connection with Mr. Henry's appointment, on October 31, 2007, the Committee awarded to Mr. Henry a non-qualified stock option to acquire 95,000 shares of the Company's common stock under the Company's 2007 Incentive Compensation Plan. Such stock option has an exercise price per share of $60.95, the closing price of the Company's common stock on such grant date. The stock options become exercisable in four equal annual installments (25% on the first, second, third, and fourth anniversary of grant date, respectively), subject to award requirements including continuous employment with the Company. The stock option expires on October 31, 2017. In addition, in connection with Mr. Henry's appointment, the Committee also approved an increase to the potential payout to Mr. Henry under his Portfolio Grant 2007-2009 ("PG07-09") award, which will be based on the Company's performance during the three years ending December 31, 2009. The potential payout that may be made to Mr. Henry in respect of PG07-09 awards ranges from a "threshold payout" of $169,675 to a "maximum payout" of $2,358,125. The "threshold payout" represents the maximum amount (assuming no downward adjustment by the Committee) that may be paid assuming the achievement of the minimum levels of performance at which a payout may first be made. The "maximum payout" represents the maximum amount (assuming no downward adjustment by the Committee) that may be paid assuming the achievement of the maximum levels of performance under the award provisions. To the extent so earned, the payout to Mr. Henry under PG07-09 would be expected to be made in February 2010.
