New York - January 28, 2008 - AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY (NYSE: AXP) today reported fourth quarter income from continuing operations* of $839 million, down 6 percent from $895 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.71, down 3 percent from $0.73 a year ago. Net income totaled $831 million for the quarter, down 10 percent from $922 million a year ago. On a per share basis, net income was $0.71, down 5 percent from $0.75 a year ago. Consolidated revenues net of interest expense rose 10 percent to $7.4 billion, up from $6.7 billion a year ago. Consolidated expenses totaled $4.7 billion, up 3 percent from $4.6 billion a year ago. The Company's return on equity (ROE) was 37.3 percent, up from 34.7 percent a year ago. For the full year, the Company reported income from continuing operations of $4.0 billion, up 12 percent from $3.6 billion a year ago. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations rose to $3.39, up 16 percent from $2.92 a year ago. Net income for the full year was $4.0 billion, an increase of 8 percent from the previous year. Earnings per share on a diluted basis increased to $3.36, up 12 percent from $2.99. "Results for the year met or exceeded all of our long-term financial targets, even though we saw clear signs of a weakening economy and business environment in December," said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive. "Strong Cardmember spending and the nearly eight and a half million new cards we added in 2007 represented a continuing return on multi-year business-building investments. "Despite the December weakness that we discussed a few weeks ago, fourth- quarter business volumes and credit indicators continued to be in the top tier of the industry. Marketing and related investments remained focused on premium segments of the market. Each of our customer groups and geographic regions contributed to the 16 percent increase in Cardmember spending. "The fourth-quarter additions to reserves were appropriate for an environment that is more difficult than we have seen in recent years. While our outlook for 2008 remains cautious, and we continue to expect slower earnings growth in the year ahead, we are not changing our fundamental approach to managing the business. We expect to take advantage of growth opportunities in those parts of the market with strong underlying economics. - ------------------------------- * As previously announced, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its international banking subsidiary, American Express Bank Ltd.(AEB), which is now included in discontinued operations. -2-
"We are not immune from further deterioration in the economic and credit environment, but we believe our focus on the premium sector should help us to weather the current conditions better than many competitors. "We also remain confident in our ability, on average and over time, to meet our long-standing financial targets of 12 to 15 percent EPS growth, at least 8 percent revenue growth and a return on equity of 33 to 36 percent." The fourth-quarter results included a previously announced $438 million ($274 million after-tax) credit-related charge in the U.S. Card Services Segment. Also, the fourth quarter included several previously announced items, including a gain of $1.13 billion ($700 million after-tax) from the Company's settlement with Visa, and: o $143 million ($89 million after-tax) of incremental investments in business-building initiatives, o $74 million ($46 million after-tax) in litigation-related costs pertaining to the lawsuit against Visa, and o $50 million ($31 million after-tax) in contributions to the American Express Charitable Fund. The fourth-quarter results also included a previously announced $685 million ($430 million after-tax) charge related to the Company's enhancements to its method of estimating the liability for Membership Rewards. Significant items in the year-ago fourth quarter included: o tax benefits totaling $45 million that related principally to certain foreign losses and to the finalization of state tax returns, and o a $68 million ($42 million after-tax) gain related to the rebalancing of an investment portfolio in the Travelers Cheques and Gift Card business. Also included in the fourth quarter's results were $16 million ($10 million after-tax) of reengineering costs. Year-ago reengineering costs totaled $64 million ($42 million after-tax). DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Discontinued operations for the fourth quarter included a loss of $8 million compared with income of $27 million during the year-ago period, both primarily reflecting the results of AEB's banking operations. -3-
SEGMENT RESULTS In the third quarter of 2007, the Company reorganized its businesses into two customer-focused groups: the Global Consumer Group and the Global Business-to-Business Group. The Company's segments were realigned accordingly. In connection with the sale of AEB and beginning with the third quarter of 2007, and for all prior periods, AEB (except for certain components of AEB that are not being sold) results have been removed from the Corporate & Other segment and reported within the discontinued operations line on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. In addition to the agreement to sell AEB to Standard Chartered PLC, American Express International Deposit Company (AEIDC) was also contracted to be sold to Standard Chartered 18 months after the close of the AEB sale through a put/call agreement. AEIDC will continue to be reflected in continuing operations, within the Corporate & Other segment, until one year before the anticipated close of this portion of the transaction. Based on the assumed completion of the AEB sale in the first quarter of 2008, we expect to begin reporting AEIDC's results in the discontinued operations line in the third quarter of 2008. The following segment discussions, as well as the selected financial data for all periods presented, reflect the changes noted above. U.S. CARD SERVICES reported fourth quarter net income of $7 million, down from $473 million a year ago. While revenues net of interest expense increased substantially from year-ago amounts, the lower net income for 2007 is principally attributed to rising credit costs and the increased expense related to Membership Rewards. Revenues net of interest expense for the fourth quarter increased 11 percent to $3.7 billion, reflecting higher spending and borrowing by consumers and small businesses, which were partially offset by higher interest expense and lower securitization income, net. Total expenses increased 25 percent. Marketing, promotion, rewards and Cardmember services expenses increased 43 percent from the year-ago period. This was primarily due to charges of $408 million ($253 million after-tax) related to the previously mentioned Membership Rewards liability estimation enhancements and $84 million ($52 million after-tax) related to incremental investments in business building initiatives above the planned level for the quarter. Human resources and other operating expenses decreased slightly. Provisions for losses increased significantly reflecting higher write-off and delinquency rates as well as growth in loans outstanding. The provision also reflects $384 million ($241 million after-tax) of the $438 million ($274 million after-tax) credit-related charge previously mentioned. That charge included $288 million ($180 million after-tax) which was added to lending reserves and $96 million ($61 million after-tax) which was added to charge card reserves. The remaining $54 million ($33 million after-tax) of the credit-related charge related to a reduction in the fair market value of the Company's retained subordinated interest in securitized Cardmember loans and decreased securitization income, net. -4-
INTERNATIONAL CARD SERVICES reported a fourth quarter net loss of $68 million, compared with net income of $99 million a year ago. While revenues net of interest expense increased substantially from year-ago amounts, the lower net income for 2007 is principally attributed to the increased expense related to Membership Rewards and increased investments in business building initiatives. Revenues net of interest expense increased 16 percent to $1.2 billion, reflecting higher Cardmember spending, as well as higher loan balances, which were partially offset by higher interest expense. Total expenses increased 55 percent. Marketing, promotion, rewards and Cardmember services expenses increased significantly reflecting $216 million ($138 million after-tax) related to the previously mentioned Membership Rewards liability estimation enhancements. The increase also reflected $20 million ($12 million after-tax) related to the previously mentioned incremental investments in business building initiatives above the planned level for the quarter. Human resources and other operating expenses increased 11 percent from a year ago. Provisions for losses increased 5 percent from a year ago as growth in the loan portfolio was offset by a lower level of write off and delinquency rates. GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES reported fourth quarter net income of $110 million, down from $117 million a year ago. While revenues net of interest expense increased substantially from year-ago amounts, the lower net income for 2007 is principally attributed to the increased expense related to Membership Rewards. Revenues net of interest expense increased 15 percent to $1.1 billion, reflecting higher spending by corporate Cardmembers and increased travel commissions. Total expenses increased 18 percent. Human resources and other operating expenses increased 10 percent reflecting continued growth in the business. Marketing, promotion, rewards and Cardmember services expenses increased significantly reflecting $61 million ($39 million after-tax) of the previously mentioned charges related to the Membership Rewards liability estimation enhancements. Provisions for losses increased $24 million from year-ago levels, primarily reflecting higher volumes and write-offs. GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES reported fourth quarter net income of $254 million, up 26 percent from $201 million a year ago. Revenues net of interest expense for the fourth quarter increased 14 percent to $1.0 billion. The increase reflected continued strong growth in merchant-related revenue primarily from higher company-wide billed business. -5-
Spending on Global Network Services cards increased 39 percent from year-ago levels reflecting continued growth in spending on cards issued by bank partners. Cards-in-force issued by bank partners increased 35 percent. Total expenses increased 10 percent, reflecting higher human resources costs and expanded marketing and promotion activities, including portions of the previously mentioned incremental business building investments above the planned level for the quarter. CORPORATE AND OTHER reported fourth quarter net income of $536 million, compared with net income of $5 million a year ago. The increase was primarily due to the previously mentioned $700 million after-tax gain from the Company's settlement agreement with Visa, offset in part by the $46 million after-tax litigation related costs associated with the lawsuit against Visa and the $31 million after-tax contribution to the American Express Charitable Fund. The year-ago quarter also included $42 million after-tax gain related to the rebalancing of an investment portfolio that lengthened average maturities to more accurately anticipate future redemptions of outstanding Travelers Cheques and Gift Card products. *** American Express Company is a leading global payments, network and travel company founded in 1850.

(Preliminary) AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION (Billions, except percentages and where indicated) (A) Card billed business includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements, and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards. (B) Total cards-in-force represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding. Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner and does not include additional supplemental cards issued on that account. Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force include basic and supplemental cards issued to employee cardmembers. Non-proprietary basic cards-in-force includes all cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements. (C) This calculation is designed to approximate merchant pricing. It represents the percentage of billed business (both proprietary and Global Network Services) retained by the Company from merchants it acquires, prior to payments to third parties unrelated to merchant acceptance. (D) Average basic cardmember spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only. Average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs (which beginning prospectively as of July 1, 2006, was reclassified from other expense to a reduction in net card fees), divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force. The adjusted average fee per card is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs. The adjusted average fee per card was $37 for the quarter and $36 for the year ended December 31, 2007, and $35 for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, and the amount of amortization excluded for these periods was $74 million for the quarter and $288 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, and $75 million for the quarter and $147 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The Company presents adjusted average fee per card because management believes that this metric presents a better picture of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products. -5-

(B) Net finance revenue, which represents cardmember lending finance revenue less cardmember lending interest expense, is computed on an annualized basis.

The difference between the "owned basis" (GAAP) information and "managed basis" information is attributable to the effects of securitization activities.

For the managed basis presentation, revenue and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans are reflected in other commissions and fees (included above in discount revenue, net card fees and other), cardmember lending finance revenue, cardmember lending interest expense, and provisions for losses. On a managed basis, there is no securitization income, net, as the managed basis presentation assumes no securitization transactions have occurred. The Company presents U.S. Card Services information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Management also believes that use of a managed basis presentation presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business. Irrespective of the on and off-balance sheet funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant in evaluating the Company's performance and can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The Company does not currently securitize international loans. -13-

EXHIBIT 99.3 [American Express Logo] 2007 FOURTH QUARTER/FULL YEAR EARNINGS SUPPLEMENT THE ENCLOSED SUMMARY SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE TEXT AND STATISTICAL TABLES INCLUDED IN AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY'S (THE "COMPANY" OR "AXP") FOURTH QUARTER/FULL YEAR 2007 EARNINGS RELEASE. THIS PRESENTATION CONTAINS CERTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES AND SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE ON WHICH THEY ARE MADE. IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL AND OTHER GOALS, ARE SET FORTH ON PAGE 37 OF THIS SUPPLEMENT, PAGES 62-63 IN THE COMPANY'S 2006 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS AND IN ITS 2006 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, AND OTHER REPORTS, ON FILE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FOURTH QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS FINANCIAL RESULTS - - Fourth quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.71 decreased 3% versus $0.73 last year. Revenues net of interest expense rose 10%. For the trailing 12 months, return on equity (ROE) was 37%. - 4Q '07 Income from continuing operations included the following items, as further referenced on page 2: - A $1.1B ($700MM after-tax) initial payment as part of the Visa litigation settlement, and in light of the settlement: - $143MM ($89MM after-tax) of incremental business-building costs; - $74MM ($46MM after-tax) of litigation-related costs; and - A $50MM ($31MM after-tax) contribution to the American Express Charitable Fund. - A $685MM ($430MM after-tax) charge to increase the Membership Rewards(R) liability. - A $438MM ($274MM after-tax) credit-related charge. - 4Q '06 Income from continuing operations included: - A $68MM ($42MM after-tax) gain related to a rebalancing program to better align the maturity profile of our Travelers Cheque and Gift Card investment portfolio with its business liquidity needs; and - $45MM of tax benefits related principally to certain foreign losses and the finalization of state tax returns. - 4Q '07 and 4Q '06 Income from continuing operations included $16MM ($10MM after-tax) and $64MM ($42MM after-tax), respectively, of reengineering costs related to restructuring efforts primarily within the International Card Services ("ICS") and Global Commercial Services ("GCS") segments in 4Q '07 and our U.S. Card Services ("USCS") and GCS segments in 4Q '06. - The Discontinued Operations line in the Consolidated Financial Statements contains the results, assets and liabilities related to various business sales. This includes the results from American Express Bank, Ltd. ("AEB"), which we announced in 3Q '07 would be sold to Standard Chartered PLC ("Standard Chartered"), as discussed further on page 2; from the international banking operations in Brazil, sold in 2Q '06, from Tax and Business Services ("TBS"), sold in 3Q '05; and from Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (formerly American Express Financial Advisors), for which the distribution of all outstanding shares was made on September 30, 2005. - 4Q '07 results reflected $8MM of losses from discontinued operations versus $27MM of income last year, primarily reflecting AEB's results in both periods. - Including discontinued operations diluted EPS on a net income basis of $0.71 decreased 5% versus last year. BUSINESS METRICS - - Compared with the fourth quarter of 2006: - Worldwide billed business of $177.5B increased 16% on continued strong growth within both the proprietary and network businesses. A comparatively weaker U.S. dollar resulted in a 3% benefit within the reported worldwide growth rate. As previously reported, worldwide growth slowed to 13% (10% FX adjusted) in December as U.S. billed business growth of 14% in the first two months of the quarter slowed to 9% in December. - Worldwide total cards in force of 86.4MM increased 11%, up 8.4MM from last year and 1.7MM during 4Q '07, as proprietary and network card growth remained strong. - Worldwide average spending per proprietary basic card in force increased 8% versus last year despite the suppressing effect of substantial card additions over the past few years. - Worldwide lending balances of $54.5B on an owned basis increased 26%; on a managed basis, worldwide lending balances of $77.2B were up 22%. CAPITAL RETURNED TO SHAREHOLDERS - - Including share repurchases and dividends, during 4Q '07 and for the full year we returned 99% and 88%, respectively, of capital generated to shareholders. On a cumulative basis, since 1994, we have returned 71% of capital generated. - Share Repurchases: During 4Q '07, 14MM shares were repurchased, versus 15MM shares in 3Q '07 and 18MM shares in 4Q '06. Since the inception of repurchase programs in December 1994, 665MM shares have been acquired under cumulative Board authorizations to repurchase up to 770MM shares, including purchases made under agreements with third parties. 1
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FOURTH QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS - - Dividend Increase: On 11/19/07 the Company's Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend by 20%, to $0.18 from $0.15 per share. ITEMS OF NOTE - - Visa Litigation Settlement: On November 7, 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement with Visa Inc., Visa USA and Visa International (collectively, "Visa") to remove it and certain of its member banks as defendants in the Company's lawsuit against MasterCard International, Inc. ("MasterCard"), Visa and their member banks. The lawsuit alleges MasterCard, Visa and their member banks illegally blocked the Company from the bank-issued card business in the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will receive an aggregate maximum payment of $2.25B. The initial payment of $1.1B ($700MM after-tax) has been recorded as a reduction to the "other, net operating expense" line within the Corporate & Other segment during 4Q '07. The remaining payments, payable in installments of up to $70MM ($43MM after-tax) per quarter over the next four years, are subject to achieving certain quarterly performance criteria within the Global Network Services ("GNS") business in the U.S. which the Company is optimistic it is positioned to meet. In light of the initial payment, the Company incurred the following additional expenses during the quarter: - $143MM ($89MM after-tax) of incremental investments in marketing and promotion and business-building initiatives above the level planned for the quarter. Costs for these initiatives were primarily "marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services" related expenses, with $84MM in USCS, $33MM in Global Network and Merchant Services ("GNMS"), $20MM in ICS, $5MM in Corporate & Other, and $1MM in GCS. - $74MM ($46MM after tax) of litigation-related costs pertaining to the lawsuit against Visa and MasterCard. These costs are reported in "other, net operating expense" within the Corporate & Other segment. - A $50MM ($31MM after tax) additional contribution to the American Express Charitable Fund, which supports the Company's ongoing philanthropic activities. This contribution was reported within "other, net operating expense" within the Corporate & Other segment. - - Membership Rewards Liability: In 4Q '07, the Company incurred costs of $685MM ($430MM after-tax) related to decisions resulting from its previously announced evaluation of enhancements to its method of estimating its liability for Membership Rewards. This charge was reported in "marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services" across the three issuing segments which offer Membership Rewards to Cardmembers, with $408MM in USCS, $216MM in ICS, and $61MM in GCS. The enhancements incorporate an actuarial based approach and reflect recent trends in redemption. They stem from the continued evolution of the Company's reward programs, the increasing emphasis on such programs by the Company and the consequent changes in Cardmember behavior. As a result, the global ultimate redemption rate assumption for current program participants increased to approximately 90 percent. The higher levels of redemption are due in part to the Company's effort to drive further Cardmember usage of the Membership Rewards program, which in turn strengthens customer loyalty and spending on American Express cards. - - Credit-Related Charge: In 4Q '07, the Company recorded a $438MM ($274MM after-tax) credit-related charge which increased the worldwide lending reserve coverage ratio to 100% of 30+ days past due loan balances and better position the Company for higher anticipated write-offs in 2008. The charge was reported within USCS, with $288MM in the "cardmember lending provision for losses," $96MM in the "charge card provision for losses" and $54MM in "securitization income, net," reflecting the corresponding reduction to the fair market value of the interest-only strip. - - 2008 Business Plan: On January 10, 2008, the Company announced that, in light of the weakening economy, its 2008 business plan anticipates slower billed business growth and higher write-off rates. This plan assumes billed business will grow between 8-10%, and managed US lending write-off rates will be in the 5.1-5.3% range for the year (please see the Appendix for further discussion of the owned and managed presentations). Marketing and promotion expenses are expected to be somewhat below 2007 levels. In such a business scenario, the flexibility the Company has built into its business model should generally position it to grow earnings per share in the 10-12% range. However, several significant gains and tax benefits in 2007 will have a negative impact on year-over-year comparisons in 2008. As a result, the Company expects reported earnings per share (from continuing operations) for 2008 to increase in the 4-6% range from 2007 levels and return on equity to be consistent with our 33-36% long term target. - - AEB Sale: On September 18, 2007, the Company announced that it entered into an agreement to sell its international banking subsidiary, AEB, and American Express International Deposit Company ("AEIDC"), a subsidiary which issues investment certificates to AEB's customers, to Standard Chartered for the approximate value of $1.1B, subject to certain regulatory approvals. The sale reflects the Company's strategic focus on the high-growth, high-return payments businesses that have driven its performance over recent years. Standard Chartered will pay the Company an amount equal to the net asset value of the AEB businesses that are being sold at the closing date plus $300MM. At December 31, 2007, this would have amounted to approximately $819MM. As discussed above, the Company also expects to realize an additional amount representing the net asset value of AEIDC which was also contracted to be sold to Standard Chartered through a put/call agreement subsequent to the sale of AEB. As of December 31, 2007, the net asset value of that business was $232MM. This value is expected to be realized through (i) dividends from the subsidiary to the Company and (ii) a subsequent payment from Standard Chartered based on the net asset value of AEIDC on the date the business is transferred to them 18 months after the completion of the sale of AEB. 2
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FOURTH QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS As a result of the agreement, beginning with 3Q '07, and for all prior periods, AEB results, assets and liabilities (except for certain components of the business which are not being sold) have been removed from the Corporate & Other segment and reported within Discontinued Operations on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, as described in the Company's Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on November 1, 2007. AEIDC will continue to be reflected in continuing operations within the Corporate & Other segment until one year before the anticipated close of this portion of the transaction. Assuming completion of the AEB sale in 1Q '08, AEIDC will be reported in Discontinued Operations beginning in 3Q '08. On September 18, the Company provided additional details related to its investment portfolio in the Form 8-K filed with the SEC, which reported the announcement of the AEB sale. As of August 31, 2007, AEIDC held investments of $4.8B, predominantly mortgage and other asset backed securities. Since August, AEIDC has actively worked to reduce risk within the portfolio, as sales and maturities totaling approximately $2.1B of the portfolio investments have been reinvested into cash equivalents. Additionally, the AEB sale agreement reduced the holding period for AEIDC investments and required reclassification of the portfolio from its previous available-for-sale status to its current trading status. The Company now reports changes in the market value of AEIDC's investment portfolio within the income statement until AEIDC is sold. The Company's earnings include losses due to mark-to-market adjustments and sales within the AEIDC portfolio of $81MM ($41MM after-tax) in 3Q '07 and $24MM ($16MM after-tax) in 4Q'07. - - Marketing, Promotion, Rewards and Cardmember Services Expenses: Increased 57%, reflecting higher rewards costs and increased marketing and promotion expenses in 4Q '07. The higher rewards costs reflect the impact of the $685MM increase to the Membership Rewards liability, as well as continued volume growth and strong cardmember program participation. Marketing expenses reflect the incremental investments in business-building initiatives and costs related to ongoing acquisition and loyalty-related programs, with a greater emphasis during the quarter on our non-U.S. activities, as well as investments in brand-related advertising programs. - - Total Interest Expense: Increased 34%, reflecting increased debt funding levels in support of growth in cardmember receivable and lending balances and a higher effective cost of funds. - - Total Provisions for Losses and Benefits: Increased 70%, reflecting the credit-related charge, growth in cardmember spending and loan volumes and a continued underlying increase in write-off and delinquency rates within the U.S. versus last year. - - Human Resources Expense: Increased 6%, reflecting the impact of a higher level of employees and merit increases. - Compared with last year, the total employee count from continuing operations of 64,800 increased by 2,300 employees, or 4%. Compared with last quarter, the employee count decreased by 300 employees. The increase versus last year primarily reflects employee additions related to customer service volumes and initiatives and the acquisition of Farrington American Express Travel Services Ltd. ("FAE Travel") in 3Q '07. REVISED SEGMENT AND STATEMENTS OF INCOME PRESENTATION - - The Company instituted organizational changes effective July 1, 2007 which reflect a reorganization of the Company into two distinct customer-focused groups: the Global Consumer Group and the Global Business-to-Business Group. The impact of these changes on the Company's reportable operating segment disclosures is as follows: - The Company continues to report the USCS segment and the GNMS segment consistent with previous reporting. - The previously reported International Card & Global Commercial Services segment is now reported as two separate segments: the ICS segment and the GCS segment. - The USCS and ICS segments are aligned with the Global Consumer Group, and the GNMS and GCS segments are aligned with the Global Business-to-Business Group. - - For additional information related to the impact of this reorganization and other changes to the Company's financial reporting, please refer to the Form 8-Ks filed with the SEC, dated November 1, 2007 and March 30, 2007, respectively. EXPANDED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES - - During the quarter, American Express continued to invest in growth opportunities through expanded products and services. In our proprietary issuing and network business we: - Added Virgin Atlantic and Hawaiian Airlines to the Membership Rewards Flight Finder feature, an online booking tool that allows charge Cardmembers enrolled in Membership Rewards and Membership Rewards First(SM) to easily search flight reward inventory, transfer points directly into a frequent flyer account, and book a reward flight in a single online transaction. - Signed an agreement with First Data Corp. to offer American Express(R) Card acceptance as part of an integrated solution for small- and medium-sized merchants.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FOURTH QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED (Preliminary) STATEMENTS OF INCOME (GAAP BASIS) # Denotes variance of more than 100%. 5
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FOURTH QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED - - Consolidated Revenues Net of Interest Expense: Consolidated revenues net of interest expense increased 10%, reflecting increases versus last year of 11% within USCS, 16% within ICS, 15% within GCS and 14% within GNMS. Revenues net of interest expense increased due to greater discount revenues, larger interest income, higher other commission and fees, increased net card fees and greater travel commissions and fees, partially offset by increased interest expense, lower other revenues and lower securitization income, net. Translation of foreign currency benefited the revenues net of interest expense growth rate by approximately 2%. - - Consolidated Expenses: Consolidated expenses increased 3%, reflecting an increase of 25% within USCS, 55% within ICS, 18% within GCS and 10% within GNMS. Expense growth was partially offset by the initial payment of the Visa litigation settlement, which is reported in the Corporate & Other segment. The total expense growth reflected higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expense, due primarily to the increase to the Membership Rewards reserve liability and incremental business-building costs, greater human resources expense, increased occupancy and equipment costs and higher communication expenses, partially offset by lower other expenses, net due to the Visa litigation settlement and lower professional services expenses. Translation of foreign currency contributed approximately 2% to the expense growth rate. - - Consolidated Provisions for Losses and Benefits: Consolidated provisions for losses and benefits increased 70% versus last year, reflecting an increase of 115% in USCS, 5% in ICS and 77% in GCS, and a 33% decrease in GNMS. Provisions rose primarily due to the credit-related charge as well as higher business volumes. Translation of foreign currency contributed approximately 2% to the provision growth rate. - - Pre-Tax Margin: Was 15.3% in 4Q '07 compared with 20.4% in 3Q '07 and 17.8% in 4Q '06. - - Effective Tax Rate: Was 26% in 4Q '07 versus 24% in 3Q '07 and 25% in 4Q '06. The 4Q '07 rate reflects certain revisions in the annual tax provision principally related to estimates in prior quarters. The 3Q '07 rate reflects $75MM in tax benefits principally related to the resolution of prior years' tax items. The 4Q '06 rate reflects $45MM of tax benefits principally related to certain foreign losses and the finalization of state tax returns. - - Discount Revenue: Rose 13% on a 16% increase in billed business. The slower revenue versus billed business growth reflects the relatively faster growth in billed business related to GNS, where we share discount revenue with our card issuing partners, and higher cash-back rewards costs and corporate incentive payments. - The average discount rate* was 2.54% in 4Q '07, 2.57% in 3Q '07 and 2.55% in 4Q '06. The decline in the rate versus 3Q '07 reflects the normal seasonal impact of a higher proportional level of retail-related business volumes. As indicated in prior quarters, selective repricing initiatives, changes in the mix of business and volume-related pricing discounts will likely result in some erosion of the average discount rate over time.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FOURTH QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED - Worldwide Billed Business: The 16% increase in worldwide billed business reflected an 11% increase in USCS, a 19% increase in ICS, a 17% increase in GCS and a 39% increase in GNS partner volume. The table below summarizes selected billed business related statistics for 4Q '07: * Captions not designated as "proprietary" include both proprietary and GNS data. ** Included in USCS. *** Included in GCS. **** Included in ICS. - U.S. non-T&E-related volume categories (which represented approximately 72% of 4Q '07 U.S. billed business) grew 14%, while T&E volumes rose 9%. - U.S. airline-related volume, which represented approximately 8% of total U.S. volumes during the quarter, increased 7% due to a 2% increase in transactions and a 5% increase in the average airline charge. - Worldwide airline volumes, which represented approximately 10% of total volumes during the quarter, increased 15% on 3% growth in transactions and a 12% increase in the average airline charge. - Assuming no changes in foreign exchange rates: Total billed business outside the U.S. reflected proprietary growth in Europe, Latin America, and Asia Pacific in the low double-digits and growth in Canada in the high single-digits. - Total cards in force: Rose 11% worldwide due to an increase of 6% in USCS, a 3% increase in ICS, a 1% increase in GCS and a 35% increase in GNS. Continued strong card acquisitions within both proprietary and GNS activities, as well as continued solid average customer retention levels, drove these results. - 600K and 1.1MM net cards were added during the quarter in the U.S. and the non-U.S. businesses, respectively. - - Net Card Fees: Increased 14% due to card growth and a higher average card fee. - - Travel Commissions and Fees: Increased 14%, reflecting a 18% increase in worldwide travel sales. - - Other Commissions and Fees: Rose 13% on higher assessments, card-related conversion revenues and other service fees. - - Securitization Income, Net: Decreased 6% primarily due to the credit-related charge of $54MM to the fair value of the interest-only strip, as well as decreased excess spread related to higher write-offs, which was somewhat offset by higher finance charge and servicing fee revenues due to a greater average balance of securitized loans, as well as higher gains from issuance. Securitization income, net represents the non-credit provision components of the gains from securitization activities within the USCS segment, fair value changes of the related interest-only strip, excess spread related to securitized loans and servicing income, net of related discounts or fees. 7

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FOURTH QUARTER 2007 OVERVIEW U.S. CARD SERVICES MANAGED BASIS For USCS, the managed basis presentation assumes that there have been no off-balance sheet securitization transactions, i.e., all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the Company's balance sheets and income statements, respectively. For the managed basis presentation, revenue and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans are reflected in other commissions and fees (included in discount revenue, net card fees and other), cardmember lending finance revenue, cardmember lending interest expense and provisions for losses. On a managed basis, there is no securitization income, net, as the managed basis presentation assumes no securitization transactions have occurred. The Company presents USCS information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Management also believes that use of a managed basis presentation presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business. Irrespective of the on- and off-balance sheet funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant in evaluating the Company's performance and can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The Company does not currently securitize international loans. On a GAAP basis, revenue and expenses from securitized cardmember loans are reflected in the Company's income statements in securitization income, net, fees and commissions, and provisions for losses for cardmember lending. At the time of a securitization transaction, the securitized cardmember loans are removed from the Company's balance sheet, and the resulting gain on sale is reflected in securitization income, net as well as an impact to provision for losses (credit reserves are no longer recorded for the cardmember loans once sold). Over the life of a securitization transaction, the Company recognizes servicing fees and other net revenues (referred to as "excess spread") related to the interests sold to investors (i.e. the investors' interests). These amounts, in addition to changes in the fair value of the interest-only strips, are reflected in securitization income, net, and fees and commissions. The Company also recognizes cardmember lending finance revenue over the life of the securitization transaction related to the interest it retains (i.e. the seller's interest). At the maturity of a securitization transaction, cardmember loans on the balance sheet increase, and the impact of the incremental required loss reserves is recorded in provisions for losses. As presented, in aggregate over the life of a securitization transaction, the pretax income impact to the Company is the same whether or not the Company had securitized cardmember loans or funded these loans through other financing activities (assuming the same financing costs). The income statement classifications, however, of specific items will differ. The following information reconciles the GAAP basis presentation for certain USCS income statement line items to the managed basis presentation, where different: 13

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FULL YEAR 2007 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED - - Consolidated Revenues Net of Interest Expense: Consolidated revenues net of interest expense increased 10%, reflecting increases versus last year of 13% within USCS, 9% within both ICS and GCS and 16% within GNMS. Revenues net of interest expense increased due to greater interest income, larger discount revenues, higher other commission and fees, greater travel commissions and fees, increased net card fees and higher securitization income net, partially offset by increased interest expense and lower other revenues. Translation of foreign currency benefited the revenues net of interest expense growth rate by approximately 2%. - - Consolidated Expenses: Consolidated expenses increased 5%, reflecting an increase of 11% within USCS, 21% within ICS, and 9% within both GCS and GNMS. Expense growth reflected higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expense, greater human resources expense, increased occupancy and equipment costs, higher communication expenses and greater professional services expenses. This was partially offset by lower other expenses, net resulting from the gain on the Visa litigation settlement in 4Q '07. Translation of foreign currency contributed approximately 2% to the expense growth rate. - - Consolidated Provisions for Losses and Benefits: Consolidated provisions for losses and benefits increased 43% versus last year, reflecting an increase of 84% in USCS, 44% in GCS and a decrease of 51% in GNMS and 5% in ICS. Provisions rose due to increases in the cardmember lending and charge card provisions. Translation of foreign currency contributed approximately 2% to the provision growth rate. - - Pre-Tax Margin: Was 20.1% in 2007 compared with 20.4% in 2006. - - Effective Tax Rate: Was 27% in 2007 versus 30% in 2006. The 2007 rate reflects the previously mentioned 2Q '07 and 3Q '07 tax benefits. The 2006 rate included the previously mentioned tax benefit in 4Q '06. - - Discount Revenue: Rose 12% on a 15% increase in billed business. The slower revenue versus billed business growth reflects the relatively faster growth in billed business related to GNS, where we share discount revenue with our card issuing partners, as well as higher cash-back rewards costs and corporate incentive payments. - The average discount rate* was 2.56% in 2007 versus 2.57% in 2006. As indicated in prior quarters, selective repricing initiatives, continued changes in the mix of business and volume-related pricing discounts will likely result in some erosion of the average discount rate over time.

Excluding the impact of the 2006 sales of our card-related operations in Brazil, Malaysia and Indonesia, Latin America and Asia Pacific exhibited double-digit proprietary growth. Excluding the impact of all three sales, total proprietary growth outside the U.S. was 11%. - - Net Card Fees: Increased 3% due to card growth. - - Travel Commissions and Fees: Increased 8%, reflecting a 13% increase in worldwide travel sales. - - Other Commissions and Fees: Rose 8% primarily due to higher assessments, card-related conversion revenues and other service fees. - - Securitization Income, Net: Increased 1% driven by a greater average balance of securitized loans and higher net gains from issuances, partially offset by higher write-offs and greater interest expense, due to a higher coupon rate paid to certificate holders. - Components of Securitization Income, Net: YEARS ENDED PERCENTAGE DECEMBER 31, INC/(DEC) ----------------- ----------- (millions) 2007 2006 ------ ------ Excess spread* $1,025 $1,055 (3)% Servicing fees 425 407 4 Gains on sales from securitizations** 57 27 # ------ ------ Total securitization income $1,507 $1,489 1 ====== ====== # Denotes variance of more than 100%. * Excess spread is the net positive cash flow from interest and fee collections allocated to the investor's interests after deducting the interest paid on investor certificates, credit losses, contractual servicing fees, other expenses, and the changes in the fair value of the interest-only strip in 2007.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FULL YEAR 2007 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED - - Other Revenues: Decreased 3% as losses related to the 3Q '07 and 4Q '07 mark-to-market adjustments and sales within the AEIDC portfolio, as well as the 4Q '06 Travelers Cheque and Gift Card investment portfolio gain, were partially offset by higher network, merchant, publishing and insurance-related revenues. - - Cardmember Lending Finance Revenue: Increased 34% due to 29% growth in average worldwide lending balances on an owned basis and a slightly higher portfolio yield. The increase also reflects the negative impact in 1Q '06 of the higher than anticipated cardmember completion of consumer debt repayment programs and certain payment waivers. - - Other Interest Income: Increased 11% primarily due to higher interest income on the Company's loan to Delta Air Lines that was on non-accrual status in 2006 and was repaid in April 2007. - - Cardmember Lending Interest Expense: Increased 45%, reflecting the increased loan balances and a higher cost of funds. - - Charge Card and Other Interest Expense: Increased 35%, reflecting a higher average cost of funds and an increased receivable balance. - - Marketing, Promotion, Rewards and Cardmember Services Expenses: Increased 20% driven primarily by the 4Q '07 increase to the Membership Rewards liability, higher volume-driven rewards expenses and the incremental marketing and promotion and business-building costs in 2Q '07 and 4Q '07. These increases were partially offset by the charges associated with adjustments made to the Membership Rewards reserve models both inside and outside the U.S. in 1Q '06 and 2Q '06. - - Human Resources Expense: Increased 8% due to a higher level of employees and merit increases which were partially offset by the 1Q '07 pension-related gain and lower severance-related costs.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FULL YEAR 2007 OVERVIEW U.S. CARD SERVICES MANAGED BASIS For USCS, the managed basis presentation assumes that there have been no off-balance sheet securitization transactions, i.e., all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the Company's balance sheets and income statements, respectively. For the managed basis presentation, revenue and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans are reflected in other commissions and fees (included in discount revenue, net card fees and other), cardmember lending finance revenue, cardmember lending interest expense and provisions for losses. On a managed basis, there is no securitization income, net, as the managed basis presentation assumes no securitization transactions have occurred. The Company presents USCS information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Management also believes that use of a managed basis presentation presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business. Irrespective of the on- and off-balance sheet funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant in evaluating the Company's performance and can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The Company does not currently securitize international loans. On a GAAP basis, revenue and expenses from securitized cardmember loans are reflected in the Company's income statements in securitization income, net, fees and commissions, and provisions for losses for cardmember lending. At the time of a securitization transaction, the securitized cardmember loans are removed from the Company's balance sheet, and the resulting gain on sale is reflected in securitization income, net, as well as an impact to provision for losses (credit reserves are no longer recorded for the cardmember loans once sold). Over the life of a securitization transaction, the Company recognizes servicing fees and other net revenues (referred to as "excess spread") related to the interests sold to investors (i.e. the investors' interests). These amounts, in addition to changes in the fair value of the interest-only strips, are reflected in securitization income, net, and fees and commissions. The Company also recognizes cardmember lending finance revenue over the life of the securitization transaction related to the interest it retains (i.e. the seller's interest). At the maturity of a securitization transaction, cardmember loans on the balance sheet increase, and the impact of the incremental required loss reserves is recorded in provisions for losses. As presented, in aggregate over the life of a securitization transaction, the pretax income impact to the Company is the same whether or not the Company had securitized cardmember loans or funded these loans through other financing activities (assuming the same financing costs). The income statement classifications, however, of specific items will differ. The following information reconciles the GAAP basis presentation for certain USCS income statement line items to the managed basis presentation, where different: 29
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FULL YEAR 2007 OVERVIEW U.S. CARD SERVICES MANAGED P&L DISCUSSION - - Discount Revenue, Net Card Fees and Other: Increased 12% largely due to higher billed business volumes, greater other commissions and fees, higher investment and interest income and higher travel revenues.

The 2006 rate included a number of items previously discussed during the year which collectively did not have a significant impact on the effective tax rate. - - Discount Revenue, Net Card Fees and Other: The increase of 9% versus 2006 was driven primarily by the higher level of card spending, increased other revenues, greater travel revenues and slightly higher card fees.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FULL YEAR 2007 OVERVIEW GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES - - Marketing, Promotion, Rewards and Cardmember Services Expenses: Increased 26%, primarily reflecting the increase to the Membership Rewards liability in 4Q '07, partially offset by the adjustments made to the Membership Rewards reserve models both inside and outside the U.S. in 1Q '06 and 2Q '06. - - Human Resources and Other Operating Expenses: Increased 8%, primarily reflecting increased human resources costs, in part due to the acquisitions of Harbor Payments and FAE Travel, increased other operating expenses from the impact of the 2006 sales of card-related operations in Brazil, Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as higher occupancy and equipment expense. These were partially offset by the pension-related gain and the reclassification to revenues of certain card acquisition-related costs effective July 1, 2006. - - Provisions for Losses: Increased 44%, reflecting higher volumes and slightly higher loss rates. - Credit Quality: * - The charge card loss ratio was 0.10% versus 0.09% last year. * There are no off-balance sheet Charge Card securitizations.

INFORMATION RELATED TO FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This release includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements, which address the Company's expected business and financial performance, among other matters, contain words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "optimistic," "intend," "plan," "aim," "will," "may," "should," "could," "would," "likely," and similar expressions. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: consumer and business spending on the Company's credit and charge card products and Travelers Cheques and other prepaid products and growth in card lending balances, which depend in part on the economic environment, and the ability to issue new and enhanced card and prepaid products, services and rewards programs, and increase revenues from such products, attract new Cardmembers, reduce Cardmember attrition, capture a greater share of existing Cardmembers' spending, and sustain premium discount rates on its card products in light of regulatory and market pressures, increase merchant coverage, retain Cardmembers after low introductory lending rates have expired, and expand the Global Network Services business; the Company's ability to manage credit risk related to consumer debt, business loans, merchants and other credit trends, which will depend in part on the economic environment, the rates of bankruptcies and unemployment, which can affect spending on card products, debt payments by individual and corporate customers and businesses that accept the Company's card products, and on the effectiveness of the Company's credit models; fluctuations in interest rates (including fluctuations in benchmarks, such as LIBOR and other benchmark rates, used to price loans and other indebtedness, as well as credit spreads in the pricing of loans and other indebtedness), which impact the Company's borrowing costs, return on lending products and the value of the Company's investments; the Company's ability to meet its ROE target range of 33 to 36 percent on average and over time, which will depend in part on factors such as the Company's ability to generate sufficient revenue growth and achieve sufficient margins, fluctuations in the capital required to support its businesses, the mix of the Company's financings, and fluctuations in the level of the Company's shareholders' equity due to share repurchases, dividends, changes in accumulated other comprehensive income and accounting changes, among other things; the actual amount to be spent by the Company on marketing, promotion, rewards and Cardmember services based on management's assessment of competitive opportunities and other factors affecting its judgment; the ability to control and manage operating, infrastructure, advertising and promotion expenses as business expands or changes, including the ability to accurately estimate the provision for the cost of the Membership Rewards program; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the Company's ability to grow its business and meet or exceed its return on shareholders' equity target by reinvesting approximately 35 percent of annually-generated capital, and returning approximately 65 percent of such capital to shareholders, over time, which will depend on the Company's ability to manage its capital needs and the effect of business mix, acquisitions and rating agency requirements; the success of the Global Network Services business in partnering with banks in the United States, which will depend in part on the extent to which such business further enhances the Company's brand, allows the Company to leverage its significant processing scale, expands merchant coverage of the network, provides Global Network Services' bank partners in the United States the benefits of greater Cardmember loyalty and higher spend per customer, and merchant benefits such as greater transaction volume and additional higher spending customers; trends in travel and entertainment spending and the overall level of consumer confidence; the costs and integration of acquisitions; the underlying assumptions and expectations related to the sale of the American Express Bank Ltd. businesses proving to be inaccurate or unrealized, including, among other things, the likelihood of and expected timing for completion of the transaction, the proceeds to be received by the Company in the transaction and the transaction's impact on the Company's earnings; the success, timeliness and financial impact (including costs, cost savings and other benefits including increased revenues), and beneficial effect on the Company's operating expense to revenue ratio, both in the short-term and over time, of reengineering initiatives being implemented or considered by the Company, including cost management, structural and strategic measures such as vendor, process, facilities and operations consolidation, outsourcing (including, among others, technologies operations), relocating certain functions to lower-cost overseas locations, moving internal and external functions to the internet to save costs, and planned staff reductions relating to certain of such reengineering actions; the Company's ability to reinvest the benefits arising from such reengineering actions in its businesses; bankruptcies, restructurings, consolidations or similar events affecting the airline or any other industry representing a significant portion of the Company's billed business, including any potential negative effect on particular card products and services and billed business generally that could result from the actual or perceived weakness of key business partners in such industries; the triggering of obligations to make payments to certain co-brand partners, merchants, vendors and customers under contractual arrangements with such parties under certain circumstances; a downturn in the Company's businesses and/or negative changes in the Company's and its subsidiaries' credit ratings, which could result in contingent payments under contracts, decreased liquidity and higher borrowing costs; accuracy of estimates for the fair value of the assets in the Company's investment portfolio and, in particular, those investments that are not readily marketable, including the valuation of the interest-only strip relating to the Company's lending securitizations; the Company's ability to invest in technology advances across all areas of its business to stay on the leading edge of technologies applicable to the payments industry; the Company's ability to protect its intellectual property rights (IP) and avoid infringing the IP of other parties; the potential negative effect on the Company's businesses and infrastructure, including information technology, of terrorist attacks, natural disasters or other catastrophic events in the future; political or economic instability in certain regions or countries, which could affect lending and other commercial activities, among other businesses, or restrictions on convertibility of certain currencies; changes in laws or government regulations; accounting changes; outcomes and costs associated with litigation and compliance and regulatory matters; and competitive pressures in all of the Company's major businesses. A further description of these and other risks and uncertainties can be found in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, and its other reports filed with the SEC. 37
APPENDIX AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY U.S. CARD SERVICES (BILLIONS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES) ESTIMATED YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2008 --------------------- Cardmember lending - owned basis (A): Average Loans $44.1 Net write-off rate 5.2-5.4% Cardmember lending - managed basis (B)(C): Average Loans $69.4 Net write-off rate 5.1-5.3% (A) "Owned," a GAAP basis measurement, reflects only Cardmember loans included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. (B) Includes on-balance sheet Cardmember loans and off-balance sheet securitized Cardmember loans. The difference between the "owned basis" (GAAP) information and "managed basis" information is attributable to the effects of securitization activities. (C) For U.S. Card Services, the managed basis presentation assumes that there have been no off-balance sheet securitization transactions, i.e., all securitized Cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the Company's balance sheets and income statements, respectively. The Company presents U.S. Card Services information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company's Cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized Cardmember loans. Management also believes that use of a managed basis presentation presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the Cardmember lending business. Irrespective of the on and off-balance sheet funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics for the entire Cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate Cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of Cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant in evaluating the Company's performance and can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized Cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The Company does not currently securitize international loans. 38
