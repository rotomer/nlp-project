New York - April 24, 2008 - AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY (NYSE: AXP) today reported first-quarter income from continuing operations of $974 million, down 11 percent from $1.1 billion a year ago. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.84, down 7 percent from $0.90 a year ago. Net income totaled $991 million for the quarter, down 6 percent from a year ago. On a per-share basis, net income was $0.85, down 2 percent from $0.87 a year ago. Consolidated revenues net of interest expense rose 11 percent to $7.2 billion, up from $6.5 billion a year ago. Consolidated expenses totaled $4.6 billion, up 14 percent from $4.0 billion a year ago. The Company's return on equity (ROE) was 35.9 percent, down from 36.6 percent a year ago. In the year-ago quarter, results from continuing operations included an $80 million ($50 million after-tax) gain related to a new accounting standard for retained interest in securitized loans and a $63 million ($39 million after-tax) gain from amendments to the Company's U.S. pension plans. The year-ago quarter also included $32 million ($21 million after-tax) of reengineering costs compared to $10 million ($7 million after-tax) in the current period. "We delivered stronger than expected revenue growth this quarter, despite a weak and uncertain U.S. economy," said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive. "Business volume growth was in the top tier of the industry, as we realized continuing returns on our multi-year investments and benefited from a diverse consumer and business-to-business portfolio. Cardmember spending rose 14 percent, driven by strength in the international markets, among bank partners and in the corporate sector. "We continued to invest in longer-term opportunities at a time when some traditional competitors have been constrained by problems elsewhere in their operations. Marketing and related spending was up 20 percent, with a focus on affluent U.S. consumers and the international markets. Investments in the business-to-business sector included the recently completed acquisition of General Electric's corporate card unit. "Loan growth slowed from the rate of recent quarters, reflecting in part credit-related actions such as targeted line reductions. Similarly, loan loss reserves rose in light of the increase in delinquencies and write-offs, particularly in those areas hit hardest by the U.S. housing market. In managing our risk profile, we are aiming to balance the challenges of what continues to be a difficult environment against longer-term growth opportunities in the payments sector. -2-
"While we continue to be cautious about the U.S. economy, we are encouraged by our performance internationally. And, based on the breadth and flexibility of our business model, we remain on track for the 4-6 percent EPS growth that we indicated at the start of the year, barring significant deterioration in the economic environment." DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Discontinued operations for the first quarter reflected income of $17 million, including an $11 million after-tax gain related to the sale of American Express Bank Ltd. (AEB). The year-ago period reflected a loss of $38 million which included a $60 million (pretax and after-tax) reserve established for regulatory and legal exposure at American Express Bank International (a subsidiary of AEB). SEGMENT RESULTS U.S. CARD SERVICES reported first-quarter net income of $523 million, down 19 percent from $644 million a year ago. Revenues net of interest expense for the first quarter increased 11 percent to $3.7 billion, reflecting higher spending and borrowing by consumers and small businesses. This was partially offset by last year's gain related to the adoption of a new accounting standard, which resulted in higher securitization income, net, in 2007. Total expenses increased 17 percent. Marketing, promotion, rewards and Cardmember services expenses increased 21 percent from the year-ago period reflecting increased investments in advertising and promotion, as well as higher rewards costs. Human resources and other operating expenses increased 12 percent from the year-ago period when these expenses included a benefit related to the U.S. pension plan curtailment of $36 million ($22 million after-tax), partially offset by reengineering charges of $14 million ($9 million after-tax) in the prior year. Provisions for losses increased 52 percent to $881 million, up from $581 million a year ago, reflecting higher write-off and delinquency rates as well as growth in loans outstanding and business volumes. The 2008 results reflect a lower tax rate that benefited from the resolution of certain tax items from previous years. -3-
INTERNATIONAL CARD SERVICES reported first-quarter net income of $133 million, up 30 percent from $102 million a year ago. Revenues net of interest expense increased 22 percent to $1.2 billion, reflecting higher Cardmember spending and borrowing. Total expenses increased 21 percent. Marketing, promotion, rewards and Cardmember services expenses increased 27 percent. Human resources and other operating expenses increased 17 percent from year-ago levels due in part to increased employee levels. Provisions for losses increased 24 percent to $229 million, up from $184 million a year ago, reflecting growth in the loan portfolio and business volumes. GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES reported first-quarter net income of $151 million, up 17 percent from $129 million a year ago. Revenues net of interest expense increased 15 percent to $1.1 billion, reflecting higher spending by corporate Cardmembers and increased travel commissions. Total expenses increased 12 percent. Human resources and other operating expenses increased 13 percent from the year-ago period when these expenses included a benefit related to the U.S. pension plan curtailment of $19 million ($12 million after-tax) partially offset by reengineering charges of $4 million ($3 million after-tax). Provisions for losses increased to $62 million, up from $30 million a year ago, reflecting higher write-offs and increased business volumes. GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES reported first-quarter net income of $223 million, down 6 percent from $236 million a year ago. Revenues net of interest expense for the first quarter increased 14 percent to $1.0 billion. The increase reflected continued strong growth in merchant-related revenue, primarily from higher company-wide billed business. Spending on Global Network Services cards increased 50 percent from year-ago levels, reflecting continued growth in spending on cards issued by bank partners. Cards-in-force issued by bank partners increased 33 percent. Total expenses increased 21 percent, reflecting higher human resources costs driven in part by an expansion of the merchant sales force and higher litigation related expenses. Year-ago results included a benefit related to the pension plan curtailment of $5 million ($3 million after-tax). Provision for losses increased $56 million due to greater merchant-related provisions in the first quarter of 2008 compared to a year ago, which reflected a Delta Air Lines-related provision benefit as it had then recently emerged from bankruptcy. -4-
CORPORATE AND OTHER reported first-quarter net loss of $56 million, compared with net loss of $16 million a year ago. The net loss reflects in part the impact of the following items: o a charge of $104 million($68 million after-tax) related to losses within the trading securities portfolio of American Express International Deposit Company, o a charge of $29 million ($19 million after-tax) related to AEB operations that were not sold, which included $7 million ($5 million after-tax) of the previously mentioned reengineering costs, partially offset by o the recognition of $70 million ($43 million after-tax) for the previously announced Visa settlement. *** American Express Company is a leading global payments and travel company founded in 1850.

(Preliminary) AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION (Billions, except percentages and where indicated) (A) Card billed business includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements, and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards. Card billed business is reflected in the United States or outside the United States based on where the cardmember is domiciled. (B) Total cards-in-force represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding. Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner and does not include additional supplemental cards issued on that account. Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force include basic and supplemental cards issued to employee cardmembers. Non-proprietary basic cards-in-force includes all cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements. (C) This calculation is designed to approximate merchant pricing. It represents the percentage of billed business (both proprietary and Global Network Services) retained by the Company from merchants it acquires, prior to payments to third parties unrelated to merchant acceptance. (D) Average basic cardmember spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only. Average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs (which beginning prospectively as of July 1, 2006, was reclassified from other expense to a reduction in net card fees), divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force. The adjusted average fee per card is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs. The adjusted average fee per card was $39 for the quarter ended March 31, 2008, and $35 for the quarter and year ended March 31, 2007, and the amount of amortization excluded for these periods was $77 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2008, and $72 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2007. The Company presents adjusted average fee per card because management believes that this metric presents a better picture of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products. -5-

(B) Net finance revenue, which represents cardmember lending finance revenue less cardmember lending interest expense, is computed on an annualized basis.

The difference between the "owned basis" (GAAP) information and "managed basis" information is attributable to the effects of securitization activities.

(Preliminary) U.S. CARD SERVICES SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION MANAGED BASIS PRESENTATION (Millions) # - Denotes a variance of more than 100%. For U.S. Card Services, the managed basis presentation assumes that there have been no off-balance sheet securitization transactions, i.e., all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the Company's balance sheets and income statements, respectively. For the managed basis presentation, revenue and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans are reflected in other commissions and fees (included above in discount revenue, net card fees and other), cardmember lending finance revenue, cardmember lending interest expense, and provisions for losses. On a managed basis, there is no securitization income, net as the managed basis presentation assumes no securitization transactions have occurred. The Company presents U.S. Card Services information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Management also believes that use of a managed basis presentation presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business. Irrespective of the on and off-balance sheet funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant in evaluating the Company's performance and can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The Company does not currently securitize international loans. -13-

EXHIBIT 99.3 [AMERICAN EXPRESS(R) LOGO] 2008 FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS SUPPLEMENT THE ENCLOSED SUMMARY SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE TEXT AND STATISTICAL TABLES INCLUDED IN AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY'S (THE "COMPANY" OR "AXP") FIRST QUARTER 2008 EARNINGS RELEASE. THIS PRESENTATION CONTAINS CERTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES AND SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE ON WHICH THEY ARE MADE. IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL AND OTHER GOALS, ARE SET FORTH ON PAGE 20 OF THIS SUPPLEMENT, PAGES 63-64 IN THE COMPANY'S 2007 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS AND IN ITS 2007 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, AND OTHER REPORTS, ON FILE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2008 OVERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS FINANCIAL RESULTS - - First quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.84 decreased 7% versus $0.90 last year. Revenues net of interest expense rose 11%. For the trailing 12 months, return on equity (ROE) was 36%. - 1Q '07 Income from continuing operations included: -- An $80MM ($50MM after-tax) net benefit in connection with the initial adoption of a new accounting standard, SFAS No. 155, that required the Company to record changes in the fair market value of its retained subordinated interest in securitized loans (or interest-only strip) in the income statement; and -- A $63MM ($39MM after-tax) gain relating to amendments to the Company's U.S. pension plans, effective July 1, 2007, that reduced projected pension obligations to plan participants. - 1Q '08 and 1Q '07 Income from continuing operations included $10MM ($7MM after-tax) and $32MM ($21MM after-tax), respectively, of reengineering costs related to restructuring efforts primarily within the Corporate & Other segment in 1Q '08, and our U.S. Card Services ("USCS"), International Card Services ("ICS"), Global Commercial Card Services ("GCS") and Corporate & Other segments in 1Q '07. - The Discontinued Operations line in the Consolidated Financial Statements contains the results, assets and liabilities related to various business sales. This primarily includes the results from American Express Bank ("AEB"), which was sold to Standard Chartered PLC ("Standard Chartered") in 1Q '08, as discussed further on page 2. -- 1Q '08 results reflected $17MM of income from discontinued operations due primarily to a net gain on the sale of AEB versus $38MM of losses last year, which reflected AEB reserves for regulatory and legal exposures. - Including discontinued operations, diluted EPS on a net income basis of $0.85 decreased 2% versus last year. BUSINESS METRICS - - Compared with the first quarter of 2007: - Worldwide billed business of $166.4B increased 14% on relatively strong growth within both the proprietary and network businesses. A comparatively weaker U.S. dollar resulted in a 3% benefit within the reported worldwide growth rate. - Worldwide total cards in force of 88.0MM increased 10%, up 8.1MM from last year and 1.6MM during 1Q '08, on continued proprietary and network card growth. - Worldwide average spending per proprietary basic card in force increased 6% versus last year despite the suppressing effect of a more difficult U.S. economy and substantial card additions over the past few years, which were partially offset by the translation benefit of a weaker U.S. dollar. - Worldwide lending balances of $49.6B on an owned basis increased 17%; on a managed basis, worldwide lending balances of $75.2B were up 19%. CAPITAL RETURNED TO SHAREHOLDERS - - Including share repurchases and dividends, during 1Q '08 we returned 38% of capital generated to shareholders. On a cumulative basis, since 1994, we have returned 70% of capital generated. - Share Repurchases: During 1Q '08, 5MM shares were repurchased, versus 14MM shares in 4Q '07 and 16MM shares in 1Q '07. Share repurchases were reduced in 1Q '08 in order to allow the capital generated through earnings to help fund the acquisition of the Corporate Payment Services ("CPS") business from GE Money, a unit of General Electric Company ("GE"). Since the inception of repurchase programs in December 1994, 670MM shares have been acquired under cumulative Board authorizations to repurchase up to 770MM shares, including purchases made under agreements with third parties. - Actual Share Activity: MILLIONS OF SHARES ------------------------ 1Q '08 4Q '07 1Q '07 ------ ------ ------ Shares outstanding - beginning of period 1,158 1,169 1,199 Repurchase of common shares (5) (14) (16) Employee benefit plans, compensation and other 5 3 5 ----- ------ ----- Shares outstanding - end of period 1,158 1,158 1,188 ===== ===== ===== -1-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2008 OVERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS ITEMS OF NOTE Acquisition of CPS: On March 28, 2008, the Company completed an agreement with GE Money to purchase GE's commercial card and corporate purchasing business unit, CPS, for $1.1B in cash and the repayment of $1.2B in CPS debt. CPS has card relationships with GE as well as more than 300 large corporate clients, which cumulatively generated over $14B in global purchase volume in 2007. CPS primarily offers charge card products similar to those offered by the Company's GCS segment. The Company expects that this acquisition will be additive to revenue growth, and will have a minor dilutive impact on both EPS and ROE in the early years following the transaction. This dilution estimate assumes that the cash used for the acquisition would otherwise be used for the repurchase of American Express common shares. Given the completion date of the transaction, there is no material impact on the Consolidated Income Statement in 1Q '08, although the cash payment, total receivables of $1.3B and goodwill and other intangible assets of $1.0B related to the transaction have been reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The receivables have initially been recorded within the "other receivables" ($1.2B) and "other loans" ($0.1B) lines on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As underlying cardmember relationships migrate to AXP products over the coming quarters, the associated receivables will be reflected in the "cardmember receivables" and "cardmember lending" lines on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As the receivables are related to commercial card relationships, they are reflected within the GCS segment, while the loans, related to small business relationships, are reflected within the USCS segment. The goodwill and intangible assets are recorded in the "other assets" line on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and have been preliminarily allocated to the GCS ($1.0B) and USCS ($22MM) segments, respectively. These allocations are expected to be finalized in 2Q '08. - - Visa Litigation Settlement: On November 7, 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement with Visa Inc., Visa USA and Visa International (collectively, "Visa") to remove Visa and certain of its member banks as defendants in the Company's lawsuit against MasterCard International, Inc. ("MasterCard"), Visa and their member banks. The lawsuit alleges MasterCard, Visa and their member banks illegally blocked the Company from the bank-issued card business in the United States. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the Company will receive an aggregate maximum payment of $2.25B. The initial payment of $1.1B ($700MM after-tax), which was received in 1Q '08, was recorded in 4Q '07 as a reduction to the "other, net expenses" line within the Corporate & Other segment. The remaining payments, payable in installments of up to $70MM ($43MM after-tax) per quarter over the next four years, are subject to achieving certain quarterly performance criteria within the U.S. Global Network Services ("GNS") business which the Company is optimistic it is positioned to meet. During 1Q '08 this performance criteria was met, and therefore, the first quarterly installment of $70MM was also recorded as a reduction to the "other, net expenses" line within the Corporate & Other segment. - - AEB and American Express International Deposit Corp. ("AEIDC"): On September 18, 2007, the Company announced that it entered into an agreement to sell its international banking subsidiary, AEB, and AEIDC, a subsidiary which issues investment certificates to AEB's customers, to Standard Chartered. On February 29, 2008, Standard Chartered completed its purchase of the AEB portion of this transaction for an amount equal to the net asset value of the businesses that were sold plus $300MM, or approximately $823MM. As discussed above, the Company also expects to realize an additional amount representing the net asset value of AEIDC which is contracted to be sold to Standard Chartered through a put/call agreement. As of March 31, 2008, the net asset value of that business was $125MM. This value is expected to be realized through (i) dividends from the subsidiary to the Company and (ii) a subsequent payment from Standard Chartered based on the net asset value of AEIDC on the date the business is transferred, which will occur in July 2009. As a result of the agreement, beginning with 3Q '07, and for all prior periods, AEB results, assets and liabilities (except for certain components of the business which were not sold) were removed from the Corporate & Other segment and reported within Discontinued Operations on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 1Q '08 results from Discontinued Operations included a gain, net of closing costs and adjustments to other comprehensive income for the businesses sold, of $11MM after-tax. 1Q '08 results from continuing operations reflected a $29MM ($19MM after-tax) charge (including $7MM, or $5MM after-tax, of the previously mentioned reengineering costs) related to the exit of certain operations, which were not part of the AEB sale. AEIDC will continue to be reflected in continuing operations within the Corporate & Other segment until one year before the anticipated close of this portion of the transaction and, therefore, is expected to be reported within Discontinued Operations beginning in 3Q '08. The AEB sale agreement reduced the holding period for AEIDC investments and required reclassification of the portfolio from its previous available-for-sale status to its current trading status. The Company now reports changes in the market value of AEIDC's investment portfolio within the income statement until AEIDC is sold. As of December 31, 2007, AEIDC held investments of $2.7B, which included $1.6B of mortgage and other asset backed securities. Since December, AEIDC has actively worked to reduce risk within the portfolio, as sales and maturities totaling approximately $1.6B of the portfolio investments have been reinvested into cash equivalents. The Company's 1Q '08 results include losses due to mark-to-market adjustments and sales within the portfolio of $104MM ($68MM after-tax), primarily within its Alt-A securities portfolio. As of March 31, 2008, AEIDC owned $0.7B of mortgage and other asset backed securities. - - Marketing, Promotion, Rewards and Cardmember Services Expenses: Increased 20%, reflecting increased marketing and promotion expenses and higher volume-driven rewards costs. Marketing expenses reflect higher business-building investments versus a reduced spending level in 1Q'07; the higher rewards costs reflect volume growth and continued strong cardmember program participation. - - Total Interest Income: Increased 14%, due to growth in the cardmember loan portfolio partially offset by a lower portfolio yield. - - Total Interest Expense: Increased 9%, reflecting increased debt funding levels in support of growth in cardmember receivable and lending balances partially offset by a lower cost of funds, due to the benefit of lower market interest rates on variably priced debt. - - Total Provisions for Losses and Benefits: Increased 48% due to an increase in write-off and delinquency rates versus last year, reflecting the more difficult U.S. credit environment, in addition to loan and business volume growth. -2-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2008 OVERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS - - Human Resources Expense: Increased 13%, reflecting the impact of a higher level of employees, merit increases and greater benefit-related costs, as well as the 1Q '07 pension-related gain. - Compared with last year, the total employee count from continuing operations of 65,700 increased by 2,500 employees, or 4%. Compared with last quarter, the employee count increased by 900 employees. The increases versus last year and last quarter primarily reflect employee additions related to business growth, various customer service and sales force related initiatives and the acquisition of Farrington American Express Travel Services Ltd. ("FAE Travel") in 3Q '07. EXPANDED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES - - During the quarter, American Express continued to invest in growth opportunities through expanded products and services. In our proprietary issuing and network business we: - Signed agreements with Heartland Payment Systems and Nova Information Systems to offer a streamlined process for new small and mid-sized merchants to accept American Express Cards.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2008 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED (Preliminary) STATEMENTS OF INCOME (GAAP BASIS) # Denotes variance of more than 100%. -4-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2008 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED - - Consolidated Revenues Net of Interest Expense: Consolidated revenues net of interest expense increased 11%, reflecting increases versus last year of 11% within USCS, 22% within ICS, 15% within GCS and 14% within GNMS. Revenues net of interest expense increased due to greater discount revenues, larger interest income, higher other commission and fees, increased net card fees and greater travel commissions and fees, partially offset by increased interest expense, lower other revenues and lower securitization income, net. Translation of foreign currency benefited the revenues net of interest expense growth rate by approximately 3%. - - Consolidated Expenses: Consolidated expenses increased 14%, reflecting an increase of 17% within USCS, 21% within ICS, 12% within GCS and 21% within GNMS. The total expense growth reflected higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expense, greater human resources expense, higher professional services expense and increased occupancy and equipment costs. Translation of foreign currency contributed approximately 3% to the expense growth rate. - - Consolidated Provisions for Losses and Benefits: Consolidated provisions for losses and benefits increased 48% versus last year, reflecting an increase of 52% in USCS, 24% in ICS and more than 100% in GCS and GNMS. Provisions rose primarily due to increases in write-off and delinquency rates versus last year, reflecting the more difficult U.S. credit environment, and higher loan and business volumes. Translation of foreign currency contributed approximately 2% to the provision growth rate. - - Pre-Tax Margin: Was 18.8% in 1Q '08 compared with 15.3% in 4Q '07 and 24.8% in 1Q '07. - - Effective Tax Rate: Was 28% in 1Q '08 versus 26% in 4Q '07 and 32% in 1Q '07. The 1Q '08 rate reflects the resolution of certain tax items from prior years. The 4Q '07 rate reflects certain revisions in the annual tax provision principally related to estimates in prior quarters. - - Discount Revenue: Rose 11% on a 14% increase in billed business. The slower revenue versus billed business growth reflects the relatively faster growth in billed business related to GNS, where we share discount revenue with our card issuing partners, and higher cash-back rewards costs and corporate incentive payments. - The average discount rate* was 2.57% in 1Q '08, 2.54% in 4Q '07 and 2.58% in 1Q '07. The increase versus 4Q '07 reflects the normal seasonal impact of a relatively lower proportional level of retail-related business volumes. As indicated in prior quarters, selective repricing initiatives, changes in the mix of business and volume-related pricing discounts will likely result in some erosion of the average discount rate over time.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2008 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED Worldwide Billed Business: The 14% increase in worldwide billed business reflected an 8% increase in USCS, a 21% increase in ICS, a 13% increase in GCS and a 50% increase in GNS partner volume. The table below summarizes selected billed business related statistics for 1Q '08: * Captions not designated as "proprietary" include both proprietary and GNS data. ** Included in USCS. *** Included in GCS. **** Included in ICS. -- U.S. non-T&E-related volume categories (which represented approximately 68% of 1Q '08 U.S. billed business) grew 11%, while T&E volumes rose 8%. -- U.S. airline-related volume, which represented approximately 11% of total U.S. volumes during the quarter, increased 10% due to a 1% increase in transactions and a 9% increase in the average airline charge. -- Worldwide airline volumes, which represented approximately 12% of total volumes during the quarter, increased 11% on 4% growth in transactions and a 7% increase in the average airline charge. -- Assuming no changes in foreign exchange rates: Total billed business outside the U.S. reflected proprietary growth in Asia Pacific and Canada in the high single-digits, growth in Europe in the low double-digits and growth in Latin America in the mid teens. - Total cards in force: Rose 10% worldwide due to an increase of 6% in USCS, a 3% increase in ICS, a 3% increase in GCS and a 33% increase in GNS. Continued strong card acquisitions within proprietary and GNS activities, as well as continued solid average customer retention levels, were partially offset by the suppressing effect of credit-related actions. -- 600K and 1.0MM net cards were added during the quarter in the U.S. and the non-U.S. businesses, respectively. - - Net Card Fees: Increased 17% due to card growth and a higher average card fee. - - Travel Commissions and Fees: Increased 13%, reflecting a 16% increase in worldwide travel sales. - - Other Commissions and Fees: Rose 16% on higher card-related assessments and conversion revenues. - - Securitization Income, Net: Decreased 3% primarily due to the increase in write-offs and a smaller increase in the fair value of the interest-only strip this year compared to last year, due in part to the initial adoption of SFAS No. 155. This was substantially offset by higher finance charge and servicing fee revenues due to a greater average balance of securitized loans, as well as lower interest expense. Securitization income, net represents the non-credit provision components of the gains from securitization activities within the USCS segment, fair value changes of the related interest-only strip and excess spread related to securitized loans and servicing income, net of related discounts or fees. -6-

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2008 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY AND TOTAL ADJUSTED ASSETS During the third quarter of 2006, the Company issued $750MM of 6.80% Subordinated Debentures due 2036 ("Subordinated Debentures"), which are automatically extendable until 2066 unless certain events occur prior to that date. In connection with the Subordinated Debentures, the Company has undertaken to disclose on a quarterly basis the amount of its "tangible common equity" and "total adjusted assets". The Company's consolidated tangible common equity amount as of the end of any fiscal quarter means the total shareholders' equity, excluding preferred stock, of the Company as reflected on its consolidated balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP as of such fiscal quarter end minus (i) intangible assets and goodwill and (ii) deferred acquisition costs, as determined in accordance with GAAP and reflected in such consolidated balance sheet. The Company calculates total adjusted assets as of the end of any fiscal quarter as the sum of (i) total consolidated assets as reflected on the Company's balance sheet minus (ii) non-securitized Cardmember lending receivables (without deduction for reserves), which are set forth on the Company's balance sheet, plus (iii) managed (i.e., securitized and non-securitized) worldwide Cardmember lending receivables as reported by the Company for such fiscal quarter. As of March 31, 2008 the Company's tangible common equity was $9B and its total adjusted assets were $161B. As of March 31, 2008 the consolidated assets, as reflected on the Company's balance sheet, were $135B. CORPORATE & OTHER - -- Net expense was $56MM in 1Q '08 compared with net income of $536MM in 4Q '07 and net expense of $16MM in 1Q '07. - The 1Q '08 expense reflects the impact of the following items: -- $43MM of after-tax income related to the Visa litigation settlement; -- A $68MM after-tax loss related to mark-to-market adjustments and sales within the AEIDC investment portfolio; and -- A $19MM after-tax charge (including $5MM of the reengineering costs noted below) related to the exit of certain AEB operations not sold. - The 4Q '07 income reflects the impact of the following items: -- A $700MM after-tax gain due to the initial payment of the Visa litigation settlement; -- A $46MM after-tax expense for litigation-related costs; -- A $31MM after-tax expense for a contribution to the American Express Charitable Fund; -- A $16MM after-tax expense due to mark-to-market adjustments and sales within the AEIDC investment portfolio; and -- A $4MM after-tax cost for incremental business-building initiatives. - The 1Q '08 and 1Q '07 expense includes $10MM and $3MM after-tax of reengineering costs, respectively. -9-

P&L DISCUSSION: - - Net Income: Decreased 19% as revenues net of interest expense rose 11%, expenses increased 17% and provisions for losses increased 52%. - 1Q '07 included the following items: -- An $80MM ($50MM after-tax) net benefit from the initial adoption of SFAS No. 155; -- A $36MM ($22MM after-tax) pension-related gain; and -- $14MM ($9MM after-tax) of reengineering expenses. - Pre-tax Margin: Was 21.3% in 1Q '08 versus (1.1%) in 4Q '07 and 30.6% in 1Q '07. - Effective Tax Rate: Was 34% in 1Q '08 compared to 118% in 4Q '07 and 38% in 1Q '07. The lower rate in 1Q '08 reflects the resolution of certain tax items from prior years. The higher rate in 4Q '07 reflects the impact of significant charges related to the Membership Rewards(R) liability, credit and incremental business-building costs on pretax income, as well as benefits related to certain revisions in the annual tax provision related to estimates in prior quarters. -10-
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2008 OVERVIEW U.S. CARD SERVICES - - Discount Revenue, Net Card Fees and Other: Increased 8% largely due to greater billed business volumes, higher net card fees, increased other commissions and fees and greater travel revenues partially offset by lower other investment and interest income. - - Cardmember Lending Finance Revenue: Increased 14% on 20% growth in average owned lending balances partially offset by a lower portfolio yield, due to the impact of reduced market interest rates on variably priced loans. - - Securitization Income, Net: Decreased 3% primarily due to the increase in write-offs and a smaller increase in the fair value of the interest-only strip this year compared to last year, due in part to the initial adoption of SFAS No. 155. This was substantially offset by higher finance charge and servicing fee revenues due to a greater average balance of securitized loans, as well as lower interest expense. Securitization income, net represents the non-credit provision components of the gains from securitization activities within the USCS segment, fair value changes of the related interest-only strip and excess spread related to securitized loans and servicing income, net of related discounts or fees. - - Cardmember Lending Interest Expense: Increased 10% on greater loan balances partially offset by a lower cost of funds. - - Charge Card and Other Interest Expense: Decreased 24% due to a lower cost of funds partially offset by a larger receivable balance. - - Marketing, Promotion, Rewards and Cardmember Services Expenses: Increased 21% due to higher marketing and promotion expenses versus a reduced spending level in 1Q '07, and greater volume-related reward costs. - - Human Resources and Other Operating Expenses: Increased 12% due to increased human resources expense, which reflected a higher level of employees in the Consumer Travel Network and the 1Q '07 pension-related gain, as well as greater other operating expenses. - - Provisions for Losses: Increased 52%, reflecting the impact of higher write-off and delinquency rates as well as loan and business volume growth. - Charge Card: * -- The loss ratio increased versus last year and was unchanged versus last quarter.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY FIRST QUARTER 2008 OVERVIEW U.S. CARD SERVICES MANAGED BASIS For USCS, the managed basis presentation assumes that there have been no off-balance sheet securitization transactions, i.e., all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the Company's balance sheets and income statements, respectively. For the managed basis presentation, revenue and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans are reflected in other commissions and fees (included in discount revenue, net card fees and other), cardmember lending finance revenue, cardmember lending interest expense and provisions for losses. On a managed basis, there is no securitization income, net, as the managed basis presentation assumes no securitization transactions have occurred. The Company presents USCS information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Management also believes that use of a managed basis presentation presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business. Irrespective of the on- and off-balance sheet funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant in evaluating the Company's performance and can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The Company does not currently securitize international loans. On a GAAP basis, revenue and expenses from securitized cardmember loans are reflected in the Company's income statements in securitization income, net, fees and commissions, and provisions for losses for cardmember lending. At the time of a securitization transaction, the securitized cardmember loans are removed from the Company's balance sheet, and the resulting gain on sale is reflected in securitization income, net as well as an impact to provision for losses (credit reserves are no longer recorded for the cardmember loans once sold). Over the life of a securitization transaction, the Company recognizes servicing fees and other net revenues (referred to as "excess spread") related to the interests sold to investors (i.e. the investors' interests). These amounts, in addition to changes in the fair value of the interest-only strips, are reflected in securitization income, net, and fees and commissions. The Company also recognizes cardmember lending finance revenue over the life of the securitization transaction related to the interest it retains (i.e. the seller's interest). At the maturity of a securitization transaction, cardmember loans on the balance sheet increase, and the impact of the incremental required loss reserves is recorded in provisions for losses. As presented, in aggregate over the life of a securitization transaction, the pretax income impact to the Company is the same whether or not the Company had securitized cardmember loans or funded these loans through other financing activities (assuming the same financing costs). The income statement classifications, however, of specific items will differ. The following information reconciles the GAAP basis presentation for certain USCS income statement line items to the managed basis presentation, where different: -12-

the Company's ability to manage credit risk related to consumer debt, business loans, merchants and other credit trends, which will depend in part on the economic environment, the rates of bankruptcies and unemployment, which can affect spending on card products, debt payments by individual and corporate customers and businesses that accept the Company's card products, and on the effectiveness of the Company's credit models; the impact of the Company's efforts to deal with delinquent Cardmembers in the current challenging economic environment, which may affect payment patterns of Cardmembers, the Company's near-term write-off rates, including in the second quarter of 2008, and the volumes of the Company's loan balances in 2008; fluctuations in interest rates (including fluctuations in benchmarks, such as LIBOR and other benchmark rates, used to price loans and other indebtedness, as well as credit spreads in the pricing of loans and other indebtedness), which impact the Company's borrowing costs, return on lending products and the value of the Company's investments; the Company's ability to meet its ROE target range of 33 to 36 percent on average and over time, which will depend in part on factors such as the Company's ability to generate sufficient revenue growth and achieve sufficient margins, fluctuations in the capital required to support its businesses, the mix of the Company's financings, and fluctuations in the level of the Company's shareholders' equity due to share repurchases, dividends, changes in accumulated other comprehensive income and accounting changes, among other things; the actual amount to be spent by the Company on marketing, promotion, rewards and Cardmember services based on management's assessment of competitive opportunities and other factors affecting its judgment; the ability to control and manage operating, infrastructure, advertising and promotion expenses as business expands or changes, including the ability to accurately estimate the provision for the cost of the Membership Rewards program; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the Company's ability to grow its business and meet or exceed its return on shareholders' equity target by reinvesting approximately 35 percent of annually-generated capital, and returning approximately 65 percent of such capital to shareholders, over time, which will depend on the Company's ability to manage its capital needs and the effect of business mix, acquisitions and rating agency requirements; the success of the Global Network Services business in partnering with banks in the United States, which will depend in part on the extent to which such business further enhances the Company's brand, allows the Company to leverage its significant processing scale, expands merchant coverage of the network, provides Global Network Services' bank partners in the United States the benefits of greater Cardmember loyalty and higher spend per customer, and merchant benefits such as greater transaction volume and additional higher spending customers; trends in travel and entertainment spending and the overall level of consumer confidence; the uncertainties associated with acquisitions, including, among others, the failure to realize anticipated business retention, growth and cost savings, as well as the ability to effectively integrate the acquired business into the Company's existing operations; the underlying assumptions and expectations related to the sale of the American Express Bank Ltd. businesses and the transaction's impact on the Company's earnings proving to be inaccurate or unrealized; the success, timeliness and financial impact (including costs, cost savings and other benefits including increased revenues), and beneficial effect on the Company's operating expense to revenue ratio, both in the short-term and over time, of reengineering initiatives being implemented or considered by the Company, including cost management, structural and strategic measures such as vendor, process, facilities and operations consolidation, outsourcing (including, among others, technologies operations), relocating certain functions to lower-cost overseas locations, moving internal and external functions to the internet to save costs, and planned staff reductions relating to certain of such reengineering actions; the Company's ability to reinvest the benefits arising from such reengineering actions in its businesses; bankruptcies, restructurings, consolidations or similar events (including, among others, the proposed Delta Northwest merger) affecting the airline or any other industry representing a significant portion of the Company's billed business, including any potential negative effect on particular card products and services and billed business generally that could result from the actual or perceived weakness of key business partners in such industries; the triggering of obligations to make payments to certain co-brand partners, merchants, vendors and customers under contractual arrangements with such parties under certain circumstances; a downturn in the Company's businesses and/or negative changes in the Company's and its subsidiaries' credit ratings, which could result in contingent payments under contracts, decreased liquidity and higher borrowing costs; accuracy of estimates for the fair value of the assets in the Company's investment portfolio and, in particular, those investments that are not readily marketable, including the valuation of the interest-only strip relating to the Company's lending securitizations; the Company's ability to invest in technology advances across all areas of its business to stay on the leading edge of technologies applicable to the payments industry; the Company's ability to protect its intellectual property rights (IP) and avoid infringing the IP of other parties; the potential negative effect on the Company's businesses and infrastructure, including information technology, of terrorist attacks, natural disasters or other catastrophic events in the future; political or economic instability in certain regions or countries, which could affect lending and other commercial activities, among other businesses, or restrictions on convertibility of certain currencies; changes in laws or government regulations; accounting changes; outcomes and costs associated with litigation and compliance and regulatory matters; and competitive pressures in all of the Company's major businesses. A further description of these and other risks and uncertainties can be found in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, and its other reports filed with the SEC. -20-
