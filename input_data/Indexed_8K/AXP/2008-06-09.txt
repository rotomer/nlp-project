Purchase Agreement
"), pursuant to the provisions of an Indenture between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (the "
Original Indenture
").
     
WHEREAS, the Company has published notice to the effect that on June 5, 2008 there will be a remarketing, pursuant to the Indenture, of the Notes with the terms set forth on Schedule A hereto.
     
WHEREAS, the Remarketing Agents, severally and not jointly, will attempt to remarket in the manner provided herein, all of the Notes tendered or deemed tendered for remarketing as provided in the Original Indenture, as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 21, 2008 (together with the Original Indenture, the "
Indenture
").
     
WHEREAS, in the event of a successful remarketing, as provided herein, the applicable interest rate on the Notes will, on June 5, 2008 (the "
Reset Date
"), be reset to the Reset Rate (as defined herein), which will be the rate the Notes must bear in order for the Notes being remarketed to be sold by the Remarketing Agents on the Reset Date at a price equal to 100% of the accreted principal amount of Notes being remarketed, plus the Remarketing Fee, as defined herein (the "
Remarketing Value
"), provided that the Reset Rate shall in no event exceed the maximum permitted by applicable law and shall not be less than 0% per annum.
     
NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the covenants herein made, and subject to the conditions herein set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:
     
Section 1
. Definitions.
Capitalized terms used and not defined in this Remarketing Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
     
Section 2
. Appointment and Obligations of Remarketing Agents: Remarketing.
     
(a)
Appointment and Obligations
. The Company hereby appoints the Remarketing Agents, and the Remarketing Agents, severally and not jointly, hereby accept such appointment, to remarket the Notes tendered or deemed tendered for remarketing on June 5, 2008 in the manner specified in Section 2(b) below and in connection therewith to determine, in consultation with the Company and in the manner provided for in the Indenture and the Notes, the reset interest rate that the Remarketing Agents believe will, when applied to the Notes, enable the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being remarketed to be sold at a price equal to the Remarketing Value (the "
Reset Rate
").
     
(b)
Pursuant to this Remarketing Agreement, the Remarketing Agents, severally and not jointly, agree, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, to use their reasonable efforts to remarket the Notes, in whole but not in part, in accordance with the
provisions
of the Notes and the Indenture, on June 5, 2008 such that the aggregate price at which such Notes are being remarketed will equal the Remarketing Value. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Remarketing Agents shall not remarket any Notes for a price less than the price (the "
Minimum Price
") necessary for the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being remarketed to have an aggregate price equal to the Remarketing Value. The Remarketing Agents shall not be obligated to remarket any Notes if a condition precedent set forth herein to such remarketing is not fulfilled or if the remarketing of such Notes would violate applicable law.
     
Upon a successful remarketing, after deducting the Remarketing Fee specified in Section 3 below, the proceeds of remarketing shall promptly be paid by the Remarketing Agents to The Depository Trust Company. In the event the remarketing is unsuccessful, the Company shall issue a press release stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes that the Company will repurchase, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. For the purposes of this Remarketing Agreement, an unsuccessful remarketing shall mean the failure of any condition set forth in Section 9 hereof to be satisfied.
     
(c)
The Remarketing Agents shall not have any obligation whatsoever to purchase any Notes, whether in connection with a remarketing or otherwise, and shall in no way be obligated to provide funds to make payment upon tender of Notes for remarketing or to otherwise expend or risk its own funds or incur or be exposed to financial liability in the performance of its duties under this Remarketing Agreement. The Company shall not be obligated in any case to provide funds to make payment upon tender of Notes for remarketing.
     
Section 3
. Fees and Expenses.
     
(a)
Upon a successful remarketing of the Notes, the Remarketing Agents are entitled to a remarketing fee (the "

The Remarketing Agents may deduct the Remarketing Fee from the proceeds of the successful remarketing to be remitted to The Depository Trust Company,
provided
,
however
, that under no circumstances may the Remarketing Agents deduct an amount greater than the excess of such proceeds over the Minimum Price. Any resulting shortfall in the recovery of the Remarketing Fee shall by payable by the Company on the Reset Date in immediately available funds or, upon the instructions of the Remarketing Agents, by certified or official bank check or checks or by wire transfer.
     
(b)
In connection with the remarketing pursuant to this Remarketing Agreement, the Company shall pay all expenses in connection therewith, as specified in Section 8(f).

Closing Time
" and such date of payment and delivery being herein called the "
Closing Date
"). Delivery of the remarketed Notes and payment of the Remarketing Fee shall be made to the Remarketing Agents against payment by the respective purchasers of the remarketed Notes of the consideration therefor as specified herein (equal to the Remarketing Value of the remarketed Notes plus accrued interest thereon at the Reset Rate from and including June 5, 2008 to but excluding the Closing Date), which consideration shall be paid to The Depository Trust Company for the account of the persons entitled thereto in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account or accounts designated by The Depository Trust Company. Any amount of the Remarketing Fee that cannot be deducted from the funds received from such purchasers shall be payable by the Company at the Closing Time in immediately available funds or, upon the instructions of the Remarketing Agents, by certified or official bank check or checks or by wire transfer.
     
With respect to Notes not represented by a Global Security held by or on behalf of The Depository Trust Company, certificates for the Notes shall be registered in such names and denominations as the Remarketing Agents may request not less than one full Business Day in advance of the Closing Date, and the Company, the Trustee and the registered holder or holders thereof agree to

If, at any time prior to the completion of the remarketing of the Notes by the Remarketing Agents, as evidenced by a notice in writing from the Remarketing Agents to the Company, any event occurs as a result of which the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then existing, not misleading, or if during such period it is necessary to amend or supplement the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus to comply with applicable law, the Company will notify the Remarketing Agents and promptly amend or supplement the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (at the expense of the Company) so as to correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance and furnish to the Remarketing Agents such amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus.
     
(d)
Blue Sky Qualifications
. The Company will use its best efforts to qualify the Notes for sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Remarketing Agents reasonably designate, to maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Notes, except that the Company shall not be required in connection therewith to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action which
would subject it to general or unlimited service of process or to taxation in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
     
(e)
Delivery of Registration Statements, General Disclosure Packages and
Prospectuses
. The Company will furnish to the Remarketing Agents copies of the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (including all documents incorporated by reference therein), and all amendments and supplements to the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, in each case in such quantities as the Remarketing Agents may from time to time reasonably request.
     
(f)
Expenses
. The Company, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereunder are consummated or this Remarketing Agreement is terminated, will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all costs, taxes (including any transfer taxes) and expenses incident to the issue and delivery of the Notes, all fees and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants, and all costs and expenses incident to the preparing, printing and distributing of all documents relating to the offering, and will reimburse the Remarketing Agents for certain expenses and disbursements (including fees and disbursements of counsel for the Remarketing Agents) incurred by them in connection with the remarketing of the Notes,the preparation of memoranda relating thereto, for any filing fee of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. relating to the Notes, and for any fees charged by investment rating agencies for rating the Notes. If the sale of Notes provided for in this Remarketing Agreement is not consummated by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Company to perform any agreement on its part to be performed, or because any other condition of the Remarketing Agents' obligations hereunder required to be fulfilled by the Company is not fulfilled, the Company will reimburse the Remarketing Agents for all reasonable out-of-pocket disbursements (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by the Remarketing Agents in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Notes.
     
(g)
Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses
. Unless it obtains the prior consent of the Remarketing Agents, the Company, and each Remarketing Agent, severally and not jointly, agrees with the Company, that it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Notes that would constitute an Issuer Limited Use Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 405, required to be filed with the SEC. The Company has treated or will treat each Issuer General Use Free Writing Prospectus as an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, and has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 applicable to any Issuer General Use Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the SEC where required, legending and record keeping.
     
Section 9.
Conditions to the Remarketing Agent's Obligations.
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the parties hereto agree (and the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes will be deemed to agree) that the obligations
of the Remarketing Agents under this Remarketing Agreement are subject to (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company contained herein and the statements in any certificates furnished by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company hereunder as of the date hereof, the Applicable Time and the Closing Time, (ii) the performance by the Company of its obligations in connection with the remarketing in this Remarketing Agreement, the Indenture or any other agreement relating to such remarketing, (iii) the Remarketing Agents are able to find a purchaser or purchasers for the Notes being remarketed at the applicable Minimum Price, (iv) no Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture), and no event that with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would become an Event of Default, shall be continuing, (v) this Remarketing Agreement has not been terminated and (vi) the satisfaction, at the Closing Time, of each of the following conditions. The Remarketing Agents may in their sole discretion waive in writing compliance with any condition to their obligations hereunder.
     
(a)
Registration Statement
. Prior to the Closing Time, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been issued and no proceedings for that purpose shall have been instituted or, to the knowledge of the Company or the Remarketing Agents, shall be threatened by the SEC.
     
(b)
Material Changes and Transactions
. Except as contemplated in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, since the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and up to the Closing Time, there shall not have been (i) any material change, on a consolidated basis, in the shareholders' equity, long-term debt, total assets, total revenue or total net income of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in the condition (financial or other) or in the earnings of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) any withdrawal or lowering of the rating assigned by a Rating Agency to any debt securities of the Company or the public announcement by any Rating Agency that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of such debt securities, but only to the extent such Rating Agency has notified the Company of such surveillance or review, which, in each case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, in the Remarketing Agents' reasonable judgment, makes it impractical or inadvisable to offer or deliver the Notes on the Closing Date, on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
     
(c)
Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, special counsel for the Company, shall have furnished to the Remarketing Agents their written opinion, dated the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Remarketing Agents, to the effect that:
     
(i)
the Company has corporate power to issue the Notes, to enter into this Remarketing Agreement and the Indenture and to perform its obligations thereunder;
     
(ii)
the execution and delivery of this Remarketing Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company; this Remarketing Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company;
     
(iii)
the execution and delivery of the Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company and the Notes have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and are the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture;
     
(iv)
the execution and delivery of the Indenture has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company; the Indenture has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the Company;
     
(v)
The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof, will not be an "investment company", as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act;
     
(vi)
the statements in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the caption "Description of the Remarketed Notes", insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the Notes and the Indenture, provide a fair summary of such provisions; and
     
(vii)
the statements made in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the headings "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations" and "Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences", insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain federal income tax laws of the United States, constitute a fair summary of the principal U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes.
     
In addition, Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton, special counsel for the Company, shall have furnished to the Remarketing Agents a letter, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that, based on such counsel's participation in certain telephone conversations in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, such counsel's review of certain corporate records and documents of the Company and such counsel's understanding of the U.S. federal securities laws and the experience they have gained in their practice thereunder, such counsel has no reason to believe that (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data and management's report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as to which such counsel need not express any belief) the Registration Statement (including the information, if any, deemed
pursuant to Rule 430A, 430B or 430C of the 1933 Act to be part of the Registration Statement at the time of effectiveness) and the Prospectus as of the date thereof and the General Disclosure Package as of the Applicable Time contained, or as of the date such letter is delivered contains, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
     
In rendering such opinion and letter as aforesaid, such counsel may, as to factual matters, rely upon written certificates or statements of officers of the Company, public and stock exchange officials. In addition, such counsel may state that (x) such opinion is limited to the federal law of the United States and the law of the State of New York, (y) they have assumed, among other things, the accuracy as to factual matters of each document they have reviewed and that the Notes conform to the form thereof they have reviewed and will be duly authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and (z) insofar as such opinions relate to the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any agreement or obligation of the Company, (1) they have assumed that the Company and each other party to such agreement or obligation has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such agreement or obligation enforceable against it (other than as to the Company regarding matters of the federal law of the United States or the law of the State of New York that in such counsel's experience are normally applicable to general business entities in relation to the transactions contemplated in this Remarketing Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes) and (2) such opinion is subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity.
     
(d)
The Company shall have furnished to the Remarketing Agents the opinion of Louise M. Parent, Esq., Executive Vice President and General Counsel to the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:
     
(i)
the Company and each of its Principal Subsidiaries have been duly incorporated and are validly existing and in good standing under the laws of their respective jurisdictions of incorporation, and have all corporate power and authority necessary to own their respective properties and conduct the businesses in which they are engaged as described in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus; and except as may be disclosed in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, all outstanding shares of capital stock of each of the Principal Subsidiaries are owned by the Company directly, or indirectly through wholly-owned Subsidiaries, free and clear of any lien, pledge and encumbrance or, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, any claim of any third party, except as permitted by the Indenture;
     
(ii)
to the best of such counsel's knowledge, neither the Company nor any of its Principal Subsidiaries is in violation of its corporate charter or by-laws, or, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, in default under any agreement, indenture or instrument the effect of any of which would be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole;
     
(iii)
neither the issuance or sale of the Notes nor the execution, delivery and performance of this Remarketing Agreement and the Indenture by the Company and the consummation by the Company of any other transactions contemplated by this Remarketing Agreement and the Indenture will conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of, or constitute a default under, any agreement, indenture or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or its properties is bound, or result in a violation of the corporate charter or by-laws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any order, rule or regulation (applicable to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties) (other than United States Federal securities laws or any state securities or Blue Sky laws) of any court or governmental agency having jurisdiction over the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective properties, the effect of any of which would be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole;
     
(iv)
such counsel (A) has no reason to believe that any document incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein as to which such counsel need express no opinion), as of the respective date of its filing with the SEC, was not appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations and (B) has no reason to believe that (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data as to which such counsel need not express any belief) the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus as of the date thereof contained, or as of the date such opinion is delivered contains, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
     
(v)
such counsel does not know of any litigation or any governmental proceeding pending or threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than as set forth, incorporated by reference or contemplated in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, which affect the subject matter of this Remarketing Agreement or the Indenture and the performance by the
Company of its obligations pursuant to and in the manner contemplated by the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, this Remarketing Agreement or the Indenture, or which would reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse change in the financial condition, results of operations or business of the Company and its Subsidiaries considered as a whole; and
     
(vi)
no consent, approval, authorization or qualification of or with any governmental authority of the United States or the State of New York is required for the issue and sale of the Notes to the Remarketing Agents pursuant to this Remarketing Agreement or the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Remarketing Agreement or the Indenture (other than federal securities laws, as to which such counsel expresses no opinion in this paragraph, and state securities or blue sky laws, as to which such counsel expresses no opinion).
     
In rendering such opinion as aforesaid, such counsel may rely upon, the representations and warranties as to factual matters made in written certificates or statements of officers of the Company and the originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to such counsel's satisfaction, of such records, documents, certificates and other instruments as in the judgment of such counsel are necessary or appropriate. In addition, such counsel may state that (x) such opinion is limited to the federal law of the United States and the law of the State of New York and (y) insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to matters concerning American Express Banking Corp., such counsel may rely upon, to the extent such counsel deems proper and to the extent specified in such opinion, opinions (reasonably satisfactory to Remarketing Agents' counsel) of the General Counsel of American Express Banking Corp.
     
(e)
The Remarketing Agents shall have received from their counsel, Sidley Austin
LLP
, an opinion to the effect that:
     
(i)
assuming the Notes have been duly authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Notes are valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity, and are entitled to the benefits of the Indenture;
     
(ii)
this Remarketing Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
     
(iii)
the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity and except as rights to indemnification and contribution may be limited under applicable law;
     
(iv)
the statements in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the caption "Description of the Remarketed Notes" insofar as such statements constitute summaries of the legal matters, documents or proceedings referred to therein, fairly summarize the matters referred to therein; and
     
(v)
such counsel has no reason to believe that (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data as to which such counsel need not express any belief) the Registration Statement (including the information, if any, deemed pursuant to Rule 430A, 430B or 430C of the 1933 Act to be part of the Registration Statement at the time of effectiveness) and the Prospectus as of the date thereof and the General Disclosure Package as of the Applicable Time contained, or as of the date such opinion is delivered contains, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
     
With respect to paragraph (v) above, Sidley Austin
LLP
may state that their beliefs are based upon their review of the Registration Statement and their participation in the preparation of the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (and any amendments or supplements thereto) and review and discussion of the contents thereof (including the review of, but not participation in the preparation of, the incorporated documents), but are without independent check or verification except as specified.
     
(f)
The Company shall have furnished to the Remarketing Agents a certificate of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, President or any Vice President and of the Chief Financial Officer, the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package, the Prospectus and this Remarketing Agreement and that:
     
(i)
the representations and warranties of the Company in this Remarketing Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied, in all material respects, with all the agreements and satisfied, in all material respects, all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
     
(ii)
the Registration Statement, General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and since the date of the Prospectus there has not occurred any event concerning which information would be required to be contained in an amended or supplemented Prospectus in order to make the statements
in the Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
     
(iii)
no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any notice objecting to its use has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and
     
(iv)
there has not occurred any change in the rating assigned by any nationally recognized securities rating agency to any securities of the Company.
     
(g)
On the date of the issuance of the Prospectus and also on the Closing Date, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Remarketing Agents letters, dated the respective dates of delivery thereof, in form and substance satisfactory to the Remarketing Agents, containing statements and information of the type customarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in or incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement, General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
     
(h)
Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Remarketing Agents such further information, certificates and documents as they may reasonably request.
     
Section 10
. Termination of Remarketing Agreement.
The Remarketing Agents shall have the right to terminate this Remarketing Agreement by giving notice as hereinafter specified at any time at or prior to the Closing Date if (i) the Company shall have failed, refused or been unable, at or prior to the Closing Date, to perform, in any material respect, any agreement on its part to be performed hereunder, (ii) any other condition of the Remarketing Agents' obligations is not fulfilled in all material respects, (iii) trading on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been wholly suspended, (iv) minimum or maximum prices for trading shall have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities shall have been required, on the New York Stock Exchange by such Exchange or by order of the SEC or any other governmental authority having jurisdiction, (v) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by federal or New York authorities, (vi) an outbreak of major hostilities in which the United States is involved has occurred, a declaration of war or national emergency had been made by Congress, or (vii) there shall have occurred such a material adverse change in general economic, political or financial conditions (or the effect of international conditions on the financial markets in the United States shall be such) which, in the Remarketing Agents' reasonable judgment, makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus. Any such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Section 8(f) and Section 12 shall at all times be effective. If the Remarketing Agents elect to
terminate this Remarketing Agreement as provided in this Section 10, the Company shall be notified promptly by the Remarketing Agents by telephone or telegram, confirmed by letter. Notwithstanding any such termination, the obligations set forth in Section 2 (insofar as such Section relates to the payment of the Remarketing Fee) and Section 3 hereof shall survive and remain in full force and effect until all amounts payable under such Sections shall have been paid in full. In addition, each former Remarketing Agent shall be entitled to the rights and benefits under Sections 11 and 12 of this Remarketing Agreement notwithstanding the replacement or resignation of such Remarketing Agent.
     
Section 11
. Remarketing Agents' Performance; Duty of Care.
The duties and obligations of each Remarketing Agent shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Remarketing Agreement. No implied covenants or obligations of or against the Remarketing Agents shall be read into this Remarketing Agreement. In the absence of bad faith on the part of the Remarketing Agents, the Remarketing Agents may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to them which purports to conform to the requirements of this Remarketing Agreement as to the truth of the statements expressed therein. The Remarketing Agents shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by them to be signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties. The Remarketing Agents shall not have any obligation to determine whether there is any limitation under applicable law on the Reset Rate on the Notes or, if there is any such limitation, the maximum permissible Reset Rate on the Notes, and the Remarketing Agents shall rely solely upon written notice from the Company as to whether or not there is any such limitation and, if so, the maximum permissible Reset Rate. The Remarketing Agents shall not incur any liability under this Remarketing Agreement to the Company, any beneficial owner or holder of Notes, or other securities, either in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent, for any action or failure to act in connection with any remarketing or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Remarketing Agreement, except to the extent that it shall have been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment that such liability has resulted from the willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence of such Remarketing Agent or from their intentional breach of their express obligations hereunder. The provisions of this Section 11 shall survive any termination of this Remarketing Agreement and shall also continue to apply to every Remarketing Agent notwithstanding their resignation or removal.
     
Section 12
. Indemnification and Contribution.
     
(a)
The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Remarketing Agent against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Remarketing Agent may become subject, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) (i) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or arise out of or are based upon the
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) in the event any Remarketing Agent is named as a defendant in any proceeding relating to the remarketing of the Notes, except to the extent finally judicially determined to be due to its gross negligence or willful misconduct; and will reimburse each Remarketing Agent for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending against such loss, claim, damage, liability or action;
provided, however
, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Remarketing Agent, specifically for use in the preparation thereof;
provided, further,
that the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to the Registration Statement, General Disclosure Package or Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Remarketing Agent from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Notes, or any person controlling such Remarketing Agent where it shall have been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment that (i) prior to the time when sales of the Notes are first made (the "
Time of Sale
") the Company shall have notified such Remarketing Agent that the Registration Statement, General Disclosure Package or Prospectus contains an untrue statement of material fact or omits to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein in order to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) such untrue statement or omission of a material fact was corrected in an amended or supplemented Registration Statement, General Disclosure Package, Prospectus or, where permitted by law, an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and such corrected Registration Statement, General Disclosure Package, Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus was provided to such Remarketing Agent far enough in advance of the Time of Sale so that such corrected Registration Statement, General Disclosure Package, Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus could have been provided to such person prior to the Time of Sale, (iii) the Remarketing Agent did not send or give such corrected Registration Statement, General Disclosure Package, Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to such person at or prior to the Time of Sale of the Securities to such person, and (iv) such loss, claim, damage or liability would not have occurred had the Remarketing Agent delivered the corrected Registration Statement, General Disclosure Package, Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to such person as provided for in clause (iii) above.
     
(b)
Each Remarketing Agent, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent,
but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Remarketing Agent, specifically for use in the preparation thereof; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action.
     
(c)
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party hereunder otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party, similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that the Remarketing Agents shall have the right to employ one separate counsel to represent jointly the Remarketing Agents and their respective controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Remarketing Agents against the Company under this Section 12 if, in the reasonable judgment of the Remarketing Agents, it is advisable for the Remarketing Agents and controlling persons to be jointly represented by separate counsel, and in that event, the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid by the Company. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding on terms reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party. An indemnifying party shall not be liable under this Section 12 to any indemnified party regarding any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding to which such indemnified party is or could have been a party and in respect of which indemnification or contribution is intended to be sought hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or consent is consented to by such indemnifying party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), in which case such indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified parties from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement, compromise or consent.
     
(d)
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 12 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other from the offering of the Notes, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions (before deducting expenses) received or realized by the Remarketing Agents. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Remarketing Agents and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Remarketing Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were to be determined by
pro rata
allocation (even if the Remarketing Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d). The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim (which shall be limited as provided in subsection (c) above if the indemnifying party has assumed the defense of any such action in accordance with the provisions thereof) which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Remarketing Agent shall be required to contribute any amount which, in the aggregate, exceeds the aggregate fees received by it under Section 3 hereof. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Remarketing Agents' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute shall be several in respective proportions as the aggregate principal amount of the Notes which are remarketed bears to the aggregate fees actually received by such Remarketing Agent under Section 3 hereof, and not joint. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this subsection (d) of notice of the commencement of any action against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against an indemnifying
party under this subsection (d), such indemnified party shall notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof if the notice specified in subsection (c) above has not been given with respect to such action; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this subsection (d).
     
The obligations of the Company under this Section 12 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Remarketing Agent within the meaning of either Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act; and the obligations of the Remarketing Agents under this Section 12 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Remarketing Agents may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company (including any person who is named in the Registration Statement, General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as about to become a director of the Company) to each officer of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act.

An explanation of the significance of ratings may be obtained from the rating agencies. Generally, rating agencies base their ratings on such material and information, and such of their own investigations, studies and assumptions, as they deem appropriate. The ratings of the notes should be evaluated independently from similar ratings of other securities. A credit rating of a security is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to review, revision, suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.
