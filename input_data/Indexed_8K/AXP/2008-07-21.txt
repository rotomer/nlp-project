New York - July 21, 2008 - AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY (NYSE: AXP) today reported second-quarter income from continuing operations of $655 million, down 37 percent from $1.0 billion a year ago. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.56, down 35 percent from $0.86 a year ago. Net income totaled $653 million for the quarter, down 38 percent from a year ago. On a per-share basis, net income was $0.56, down 36 percent from $0.88 a year ago. Consolidated revenues net of interest expense rose 8 percent to $7.5 billion, up from $6.9 billion a year ago. Consolidated expenses totaled $4.8 billion, up 6 percent from $4.6 billion a year ago. The Company's return on equity (ROE) was 31.1 percent, down from 37.5 percent a year ago. The second quarter results included a $600 million ($374 million after-tax) addition to U.S. lending credit reserves that reflects a deterioration of credit indicators beyond our prior expectation, and a $136 million ($85 million after-tax) charge to the fair market value of the Company's retained interest in securitized Cardmember loans. The second quarter also included a tax benefit of $101 million primarily related to resolution of certain prior years' tax items. Year-ago results included a $65 million tax benefit from the IRS related to the treatment of certain prior years' card fee income. "Fallout from a weaker U.S. economy accelerated during June with consumer confidence dropping, unemployment rates moving sharply higher and home prices declining at the fastest rate in decades," said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive officer. "Consumer spending slowed during the latter part of the quarter and credit indicators deteriorated beyond our expectations. "In light of the weakening economy, we are no longer tracking to our prior forecast of 4-6 percent earnings per share growth. That outlook was based on business and economic conditions in line with, or moderately worse than, January 2008. The environment has weakened significantly since then, particularly during the month of June. "The scope of the economic fallout was evident even among our longer term, superprime Cardmembers," Mr. Chenault said. "Newer Cardmembers -- whose write-off levels are typically higher than the total portfolio -- are also feeling the impact, but we are confident that the relationships we've built during the last several years will generate attractive economics over their life cycle. -2-
"Despite the weakness in our bottom line, revenue grew a strong 8 percent and many of our key business metrics performed very well as we benefited from the strength of our international consumer and Global Business-to-Business operations. "While we are obviously disappointed in the impact that the higher reserves had on earnings, our coverage levels are now substantially higher than at any point during the last three years. The current reserves reflect our expectation that write-offs will continue to rise in the remainder of 2008. "We remain focused on gaining profitable share but, as you would expect in this environment, we will be very selective with our investment dollars. While we continue to scale back some card acquisition efforts and reduce credit lines selectively, we also plan to take advantage of growth opportunities in the marketplace. "Our reengineering efforts over the past decade have resulted in a well controlled expense base, but in order to give us greater flexibility to invest in the business, we are accelerating those efforts. Our aim is to free-up resources by reducing overall costs and staffing levels. While we have not yet quantified the impact of these activities, we expect them to result in restructuring-related charges during the second half. "While we have been able to generate substantial earnings and returns relative to many in the financial sector, we do not expect to meet or exceed our long-term financial targets until we see improvements in the economy. "We do not know the extent of the current downturn, but the position of our company today is financially sound and competitively strong. We've lowered our risk profile by divesting some businesses and we are well-positioned to execute against growth opportunities in a manner that continues to appropriately balance our short, medium and long-term objectives." DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Discontinued operations for the second quarter reflected a loss of $2 million compared with income of $17 million during the year-ago period, which included results of American Express Bank Ltd. SEGMENT RESULTS U.S. CARD SERVICES reported second-quarter net income of $21 million, down from $580 million a year ago. Revenues net of interest expense for the second quarter increased 1 percent to $3.6 billion, reflecting higher Cardmember spending and borrowing. This benefit was partially offset by lower securitization income, net, which reflected the $136 million charge noted above, and lower net interest income. -3-
Total expenses increased 2 percent. Marketing, promotion, rewards and Cardmember services expenses decreased 2 percent from the year-ago period reflecting lower investments in marketing and promotion, which were partially offset by increased rewards costs. Human resources and other operating expenses increased 9 percent from the year-ago period driven by volume-related operating expenses, including increased credit and collection costs. The net loan write-off rate on a managed basis(1) and adjusted to conform to the industry standard of excluding fees and interest was 5.3 percent, up from 4.3 percent in the first quarter and 2.9 percent a year ago. Including fees and interest, the managed net write-off rate was 6.5 percent, up from 5.3 percent in the first quarter and 3.7 percent a year ago. Provisions for losses increased significantly to $1.5 billion, up from $640 million a year ago. This reflected the previously-mentioned $600 million ($374 million after-tax) addition, increased write-off and delinquency rates and also the higher level of loans and business volumes compared to the year-ago period. The 2008 and 2007 results reflect a tax benefit due to the resolution of certain tax items from previous years, as mentioned above. INTERNATIONAL CARD SERVICES reported second-quarter net income of $115 million, down 2 percent from $117 million, reflecting substantially higher investment levels compared to the year ago period. Revenues net of interest expense increased 20 percent to $1.3 billion, reflecting higher Cardmember spending and borrowing. Total expenses increased 26 percent. Marketing, promotion, rewards and Cardmember services expenses increased 38 percent reflecting significantly increased marketing and promotion expenses and higher volume related rewards costs. Human resources and other operating expenses increased 19 percent from year-ago levels due to increased employee levels and higher professional services costs. Provisions for losses rose to $242 million, from $211 million a year ago reflecting growth in the loan portfolio and business volumes. - --------------- (1) The "managed basis" presentation includes on-balance sheet Cardmember loans and off-balance sheet securitized Cardmember loans. The difference between the "owned basis" (i.e., GAAP) information and "managed basis" information is attributable to the effects of the Company's securitization activities. Owned net write-offs, including write-offs of accrued interest and fees, were 7.1 percent in the quarter, up from 5.5 percent in the first quarter and 3.7 percent a year ago. -4-
GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES reported second-quarter net income of $227 million, up 40 percent from $162 million a year ago. Revenues net of interest expense increased 21 percent to $1.3 billion, reflecting higher spending by corporate Cardmembers and increased travel commissions. Total expenses increased 14 percent. Marketing, promotion, rewards and Cardmember services expenses increased 19 percent from the year-ago period reflecting higher volume-related rewards costs. Human resources and other operating expenses increased 13 percent from the year-ago period. Both the revenue and expense growth rates were affected by the acquisition of Corporate Payment Services, General Electric Company's commercial card and corporate purchasing unit, in March 2008. GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES reported second-quarter net income of $299 million, up 12 percent from $266 million a year ago. Revenues net of interest expense for the second quarter increased 12 percent to $1.1 billion. The increase reflected continued strong growth in merchant-related revenue, primarily from higher company-wide billed business. Spending on Global Network Services cards increased 42 percent from year-ago levels, reflecting continued growth in spending on cards issued by bank partners. Cards-in-force issued by bank partners increased 28 percent. Total expenses increased 6 percent, reflecting higher human resources costs driven in part by an expansion of the merchant sales force and gains related to the sale of merchant-related operations in Russia in the year-ago period, partially offset by lower litigation-related expenses in the current period. Provision for losses increased $48 million due to greater merchant-related provisions in the second quarter of 2008 compared to a year ago. CORPORATE AND OTHER reported a second-quarter net loss of $7 million, compared with a net loss of $85 million from a year ago reflecting the recognition of $70 million ($43 million after-tax) for the previously announced Visa settlement.

(Preliminary) AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION (Billions, except percentages and where indicated) (A) Card billed business includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements, and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards. Card billed business is reflected in the United States or outside the United States based on where the cardmember is domiciled. (B) Total cards-in-force represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding. Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner and does not include additional supplemental cards issued on that account. Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force include basic and supplemental cards issued to employee cardmembers. Non-proprietary basic cards-in-force includes all cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements. (C) This calculation is designed to approximate merchant pricing. It represents the percentage of billed business (both proprietary and Global Network Services) retained by the Company from merchants it acquires, prior to payments to third parties unrelated to merchant acceptance. (D) Average basic cardmember spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only. Average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs, divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force. The adjusted average fee per card is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs. The adjusted average fee per card was $39 for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, and $36 for the quarter ended June 30, 2007, and the amount of amortization excluded for these periods was $82 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, and $71 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2007. The Company presents adjusted average fee per card because management believes that this metric presents a better picture of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products. -5-

The difference between the "owned basis" (GAAP) information and "managed basis" information is attributable to the effects of securitization activities.

(Preliminary) U.S. CARD SERVICES SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION MANAGED BASIS PRESENTATION (Millions) # - Denotes a variance of more than 100%. For U.S. Card Services, the managed basis presentation assumes that there have been no off-balance sheet securitization transactions, i.e., all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the Company's balance sheets and income statements, respectively. For the managed basis presentation, revenue and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans are reflected in other commissions and fees (included above in discount revenue, net card fees and other), cardmember lending finance revenue, cardmember lending interest expense, and provisions for losses. On a managed basis, there is no securitization income, net as the managed basis presentation assumes no securitization transactions have occurred. The Company presents U.S. Card Services information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Management also believes that use of a managed basis presentation presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business. Irrespective of the on and off-balance sheet funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant in evaluating the Company's performance and can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The Company does not currently securitize international loans. -13-
(Preliminary) U.S. CARD SERVICES SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION (Billions, except percentages and where indicated) (A) Segment capital includes an allocation attributable to goodwill and other intangibles of $175 million and $22 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, and $168 million and none for the quarter ended June 30, 2007, respectively. (B) Computed on a trailing 12-month basis using segment income and equity capital allocated to segments based upon specific business operational needs, risk measures, and regulatory capital requirements. Return on tangible segment capital excludes goodwill and other intangibles.

EXHIBIT 99.3 [LOGO OF AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY] 2008 SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS SUPPLEMENT THE ENCLOSED SUMMARY SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE TEXT AND STATISTICAL TABLES INCLUDED IN AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY'S (THE "COMPANY" OR "AXP") SECOND QUARTER 2008 EARNINGS RELEASE. THIS PRESENTATION CONTAINS CERTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES AND SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE ON WHICH THEY ARE MADE. IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL AND OTHER GOALS, ARE SET FORTH ON PAGE 21 OF THIS SUPPLEMENT, PAGES 63-64 IN THE COMPANY'S 2007 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS AND IN ITS 2007 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, AND OTHER REPORTS, ON FILE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2008 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS - - Second quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.56 decreased 35% versus $0.86 last year. Revenues net of interest expense rose 8%. For the trailing 12 months, return on equity (ROE) was 31% and return on tangible equity (ROTE), which excludes goodwill and intangibles, was 38%.* - 2Q '08 Income from continuing operations included: -- A $600MM ($374MM after-tax) addition to lending credit reserves; -- A $136MM ($85MM after-tax) charge to the fair market value of the Company's interest-only strip ("I/O Strip"); and -- A $101MM tax benefit related to the resolution of certain prior years' tax items. - 2Q '07 Income from continuing operations included a $65MM tax benefit from the IRS related to the treatment of prior years' card fee income. - 2Q '08 and 2Q '07 Income from continuing operations included $7MM ($4MM after-tax) and $8MM ($5MM after-tax), respectively, of reengineering costs primarily within the Global Commercial Services ("GCS") and the Corporate & Other segments. - The Discontinued Operations line in the Consolidated Financial Statements contains the results, assets and liabilities related to various business sales. This primarily includes the results from American Express Bank, Ltd. ("AEB"), which was sold to Standard Chartered PLC ("Standard Chartered") in 1Q '08, as discussed further on page 2. -- 2Q '08 results reflected $2MM of losses from discontinued operations versus $17MM of income last year, primarily related to AEB. - Including discontinued operations, diluted EPS on a net income basis of $0.56 decreased 36% versus last year. BUSINESS METRICS - - Compared with the second quarter of 2007: - Worldwide billed business of $180.9B increased 12% on relatively strong growth within both the proprietary and network businesses. A comparatively weaker U.S. dollar resulted in a 2% benefit within the reported worldwide growth rate. - Worldwide total cards in force of 90.1MM increased 10%, up 7.9MM from last year and 2.1MM during 2Q '08, on continued proprietary and network card growth. - Worldwide average spending per proprietary basic card in force increased 5% versus last year despite the suppressing effect of a more difficult U.S. economy and substantial card additions over the past few years. - Worldwide lending balances of $49.7B on an owned basis increased 3%; on a managed basis, worldwide lending balances of $76.6B were up 12%. CAPITAL RETURNED TO SHAREHOLDERS - - During 2Q '08 we returned 27% of capital generated to shareholders. On a cumulative basis, since 1994, we have returned 69% of capital generated through share repurchases and dividends. - SHARE REPURCHASES: During 2Q '08, no shares were repurchased, versus 5MM shares in 1Q '08 and 15MM shares in 2Q '07. Share repurchases were curtailed in 2Q '08 in light of the uncertain U.S. economic environment. In 1Q '08, share repurchases were reduced from previous levels to allow the capital generated through earnings to help fund the acquisition of the Corporate Payment Services ("CPS") business from GE Money, a unit of General Electric Company ("GE"). Since the inception of repurchase programs in December 1994, 670MM shares have been acquired under cumulative Board authorizations to repurchase up to 770MM shares. * Please refer to p. 37 of the Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Release, American Express Company Statistical Information pages, for a GAAP reconciliation of ROTE on both a consolidated and segment basis. 1
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2008 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED ITEMS OF NOTE - - LENDING RESERVE ADDITION: In June 2008, the Company recorded a $600MM ($374MM after-tax) addition to U.S. cardmember lending credit reserves, as credit trends weakened beyond our prior expectations due to deterioration in the U.S. economy. The addition increases our worldwide lending reserve coverage ratio to 135% of 30+ days past due loan balances. This charge was reported within our U.S. Card Services segment ("USCS") in the "cardmember lending provision for losses" line on the P&L. - - I/O STRIP ADJUSTMENT: A $136MM ($85MM after-tax) charge was recorded to reduce the fair market value of the I/O Strip to reflect assumptions for higher default rates and lower net spreads on the securitized lending portfolio, and was recorded as a reduction to the "securitization income, net" line within USCS. - - VISA AND MASTERCARD LITIGATION SETTLEMENTS: In November of 2004 the Company filed suit against Visa Inc., Visa USA and Visa International (collectively "Visa"), MasterCard Inc., ("MasterCard") and certain of their member banks to seek monetary damages for the lost business opportunity that resulted from the illegal conspiracy to boycott American Express from partnering with U.S. credit card issuing banks. The Company announced that it had reached an agreement with Visa on November 7, 2007 and with MasterCard on June 25, 2008. All defendants have been removed and the case is now dismissed. Under the terms of the settlement agreements, the Company will receive aggregate maximum payments of $2.25B from Visa and $1.8B from MasterCard. The total of more than $4.0B represents the largest antitrust settlement in U.S. history. The settlement with Visa is comprised of an initial payment of $1.13B ($700MM after-tax) that was recorded in 4Q '07 and received in March 2008, and quarterly payments of up to $70MM ($43MM after-tax) for four years from 1Q '08 through 4Q '11. The Company has recognized $70MM from Visa in both 1Q '08 and 2Q '08 pursuant to this agreement. The settlement with MasterCard is comprised of quarterly payments of up to $150MM ($93MM after-tax) for three years from 3Q '08 through 2Q '11. Installment payments from both parties are subject to the Company achieving certain quarterly performance criteria in the Global Network Services ("GNS") business within the U.S., which the Company is optimistic it is positioned to meet. Payments earned through June 2008 have been recorded as a reduction to the "other, net expenses" line within the Corporate & Other segment. - - ACQUISITION OF CPS: On March 28, 2008, the Company completed its purchase of GE's commercial card and corporate purchasing business unit, CPS, for $1.1B in cash and the repayment of $1.2B in CPS debt. The purchase included card relationships with GE as well as more than 300 large corporate clients, which cumulatively generated over $14B in global purchase volume in 2007. The Company expects that this acquisition will be additive to revenue growth, and will have a minor dilutive impact on both EPS and ROE in the early years following the transaction. This dilution estimate assumes the cash used for the purchase price would otherwise have been used for the repurchase of American Express common shares. In 1Q '08 the cash payment, total receivables of $1.3B and goodwill and other intangible assets of $1.0B related to the transaction were reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Receivables have been initially recorded within the "other receivables" ($1.2B) and "other loans" ($0.1B) lines. As underlying cardmember relationships migrate to AXP products over the coming quarters, the associated receivables will be reflected in the "cardmember receivables" and "cardmember lending" lines. As the receivables are related to commercial card relationships, they are reflected within the GCS segment, while the loans, related to small business relationships, are reflected within the USCS segment. The goodwill and intangible assets are recorded in the "other assets" line on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and have been preliminarily allocated to the GCS ($1.0B) and USCS ($21MM) segments, respectively. - - AEB AND AMERICAN EXPRESS INTERNATIONAL DEPOSIT CORP. ("AEIDC"): On September 18, 2007, the Company announced that it entered into an agreement to sell AEB, its international banking subsidiary, and AEIDC, a subsidiary which issues investment certificates to AEB's customers, to Standard Chartered. On February 29, 2008, Standard Chartered completed its purchase of the AEB portion of this transaction. In 2Q '08, the Company and Standard Chartered agreed on the final purchase price of $796MM, equaling the final net asset value of the businesses that were sold plus $300MM. The Company also expects to realize an additional amount representing the final net asset value of AEIDC which is contracted to be sold to Standard Chartered through a put/call agreement. As of June 30, 2008, the net asset value of that business was $117MM. This value is expected to be realized through (i) dividends from the subsidiary to the Company and (ii) a subsequent payment from Standard Chartered based on the net asset value of AEIDC on the date the business is transferred, which will occur in August 2009. As a result of the agreement, beginning with 3Q '07 and for all prior periods, AEB results, assets and liabilities (except for certain components of the business which were not sold) were removed from the Corporate & Other segment and reported within Discontinued Operations on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. AEIDC is being reflected in continuing operations within the Corporate & Other segment until one year before the anticipated close of this portion of the transaction. Therefore, beginning in 3Q '08, AEIDC is expected to be reported within Discontinued Operations. The AEB sale agreement reduced the holding period for AEIDC investments and required reclassification of the portfolio from its previous available-for-sale status to its current trading status. The Company now reports changes in the market value of AEIDC's investment portfolio within the income statement until AEIDC is sold. As of December 31, 2007, AEIDC held investments of $2.7B, which included $1.6B of mortgage and other asset backed securities. Since December, AEIDC has actively worked to reduce risk within the portfolio, as sales and maturities totaling approximately $1.9B of the portfolio investments have been reinvested into cash equivalents, or used to repay the investment certificate deposit holders. The Company's 2Q '08 results include losses due to mark-to-market adjustments and sales within the portfolio of $6MM ($4MM after-tax). As of June 30, 2008, AEIDC owned $0.6B of mortgage and other asset backed securities. - - MARKETING, PROMOTION, REWARDS AND CARDMEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES: Increased 5%, on higher volume-driven rewards costs reflecting volume growth and continued strong cardmember program participation. Marketing and promotion expenses were flat, reflecting a consistent consolidated level of business-building investments versus 2Q '07, but with a greater emphasis during the quarter on our non-U.S. activities. 2
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2008 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED - - TOTAL INTEREST INCOME: Decreased 3% due to lower AEIDC-related income this year and interest income last year related to the Company's loan to Delta Air Lines, which was repaid in April 2007 and was previously on non-accrual status. Additionally, cardmember lending finance revenue was unchanged as loan growth was offset by a lower portfolio yield, driven by the impact of reduced market interest rates on variably priced loans. - - TOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE: Decreased 9%, reflecting a lower cost of funds, due to the benefit of lower market interest rates on variably priced debt, which more than offset increased debt funding levels in support of growth in cardmember receivable and lending balances. - - TOTAL PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES AND BENEFITS: Increased 93% reflecting the difficult U.S. credit environment, which led to increased write-off and delinquency rates and the lending reserve addition, as well as increased loan and business volumes. - - HUMAN RESOURCES EXPENSE: Increased 12%, reflecting the impact of a higher level of employees, merit increases and greater benefit-related costs. - Compared with last year, the total employee count from continuing operations of 66,500 increased by 2,700 employees, or 4%. Compared with last quarter, the employee count increased by 800 employees. The increases versus last year and last quarter primarily reflect employee additions related to business growth, various customer service and sales force-related initiatives and the acquisitions of CPS in 1Q '08 and Farrington American Express Travel Services Ltd. in 3Q '07. EXPANDED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES - - During the quarter, American Express continued to invest in growth opportunities through expanded products and services. In our proprietary issuing and network business we: - Launched the Delta Reserve Credit Card for U.S. based consumers and small businesses. These new products will offer added value, flexibility and new benefits for Cardmembers most loyal to Delta Air Lines. - Expanded the 2008 Membership Rewards Program(R) to include Wynn Las Vegas, Air Tahiti Nui, west elm(R), Legal Sea Food, Forth Wall Restaurants, U.S. Golf Association (USGA(R)), Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group and The Peninsula Hotels. - With Rearden Commerce, Inc. announced the launch of American Express Anywhere(SM), an innovative new mobile service that enables corporate customers to manage travel details and business through their BlackBerry(TM) smartphones. - Launched MEMBERS KNOW, a unique online travel community for American Express Cardmembers to share knowledge and travel insights from their personal travel experiences. - Announced the return of Members Project, the online initiative that enables Cardmembers to submit, discuss and vote on projects that make a positive impact in the world. At the conclusion, American Express will fund five projects for a total of $2.5MM. - Launched the Leadership Academy, a nationwide program to develop future leaders in the nonprofit sector. The Academy is part of a broader commitment from the American Express Foundation to develop a broader pool of world-class leaders committed to working in the nonprofit sector. - Announced five historic New Orleans sites chosen to receive preservation grants from American Express through the Partners in Preservation program with the National Trust for Historic Preservation. - Announced a partnership between OPEN from American Express(R) and Meetup, a leading social media company that brings groups together offline, to launch "Ideas for a Growing Business," a six-month event curriculum for small business Meetup groups designed to stimulate small business growth. - Announced new and expanded initiatives with Consumer Action to increase the reach and impact of our joint program, "Credit Cards: What You Need to Know." Through this program American Express intends to deepen its long-standing commitment to educate consumers about the right tools for a responsible approach to personal finance. - Released the newest television commercial as part of the "Are You a Cardmember?(R)" brand campaign, featuring comedian and talk show host Ellen DeGeneres and a cameo with Beyonce shining a spotlight on the value of membership and its array of special entertainment benefits and services. In our Global Network Services ("GNS") business we: - With our partner ICBC, launched new airline cobrand cards with China Southern Airlines. One of the products, The Southern Airlines Pearl ICBC American Express Corporate Card, is the first airline cobrand corporate card in China. - Launched the MUFG Gold American Express Card, the first card product with our partner, Mitsubishi UFJ Nicos Ltd., in Japan. - With our partner MBNA, announced the launch of the Miles & More American Express(R) Credit Card.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2008 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED (Preliminary) STATEMENTS OF INCOME (GAAP BASIS) # Denotes variance of more than 100%. 5
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2008 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED - - CONSOLIDATED REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE: Consolidated revenues net of interest expense increased 8%, reflecting increases versus last year of 1% within USCS, 20% within International Card Services ("ICS"), 21% within GCS and 12% within Global Network Merchant Services ("GNMS"). Revenues net of interest expense increased due to greater discount revenues, higher other revenues, lower interest expense, greater travel commissions and fees, increased net card fees, and higher other commissions and fees, partially offset by lower securitization income, net and lower interest income. Translation of foreign currency benefited the revenues net of interest expense growth rate by approximately 2%. - - CONSOLIDATED EXPENSES: Consolidated expenses increased 6%, reflecting an increase of 2% within USCS, 26% within ICS, 14% within GCS and 6% within GNMS. The total expense growth reflected greater human resources expense, higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expense, increased occupancy and equipment costs, higher professional services expense and increased communications expense, partially offset by lower other expense, net. Translation of foreign currency contributed approximately 2% to the expense growth rate. - - CONSOLIDATED PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES AND BENEFITS: Consolidated provisions for losses and benefits increased 93% versus last year, reflecting an increase of more than 100% in USCS and GNMS, and increases of 15% in ICS and 11% in GCS. Provisions rose primarily due to the difficult U.S. credit environment, which led to increased write-off and delinquency rates versus last year and the lending reserve addition, higher loan and business volumes and increased merchant-related reserves. Translation of foreign currency contributed approximately 1% to the provision growth rate. - - PRE-TAX MARGIN: Was 10.2% in 2Q '08 compared with 18.8% in 1Q '08 and 20.3% in 2Q '07. - - EFFECTIVE TAX RATE: Was 14% in 2Q '08 versus 28% in 1Q '08 and 26% in 2Q '07. The rates for each of these periods reflect tax benefits related to the resolution of certain tax items from prior years. - - DISCOUNT REVENUE: Rose 9% on a 12% increase in billed business. The slower revenue versus billed business growth reflects the relatively faster growth in billed business related to GNS, where we share discount revenue with our card issuing partners, and higher cash-back rewards costs. - The average discount rate* was 2.56% in 2Q '08 versus 2.57% in both 1Q '08 and 2Q '07, respectively. As indicated in prior quarters, selective repricing initiatives, changes in the mix of business and volume-related pricing discounts will likely result in some erosion of the average discount rate over time. * For additional information about billed business and discount rate calculations, please refer to the Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Release, American Express Company Selected Statistical Information pages. ** Proprietary card activity only. 6
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2008 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED - WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS: The 12% increase in worldwide billed business reflected a 6% increase in USCS, a 20% increase in ICS, a 14% increase in GCS and a 42% increase in GNS partner volume. The table below summarizes selected billed business related statistics for 2Q '08: * Captions not designated as "proprietary" include both proprietary and GNS data. ** Included in USCS. *** Included in GCS. **** Included in ICS. -- U.S. non-T&E-related volume categories (which represented approximately 69% of total U.S. billed business) grew 9%, while T&E volumes rose 7%. -- U.S. airline-related volume, which represented approximately 10% of total U.S. volumes during the quarter, increased 11% due to a 1% increase in transactions and a 11% increase in the average airline charge. -- Worldwide airline volumes, which represented approximately 12% of total volumes during the quarter, increased 13% on 4% growth in transactions and a 9% increase in the average airline charge. -- Assuming no changes in foreign exchange rates: Total billed business outside the U.S. reflected proprietary growth in Asia Pacific in the high single-digits, growth in Canada and Europe in the low double-digits and Latin America in the mid teens. - TOTAL CARDS IN FORCE: Rose 10% worldwide due to an increase of 5% in USCS, a 4% increase in ICS, a 3% increase in GCS and a 28% increase in GNS. Continued strong card acquisitions within proprietary and GNS activities, as well as continued solid average customer retention levels, were partially offset by the suppressing effect of credit-related actions. -- 600K and 1.5MM net cards were added during the quarter in the U.S. and the non-U.S. businesses, respectively. - - NET CARD FEES: Increased 15% due to a higher average fee per proprietary card and card growth. - - TRAVEL COMMISSIONS AND FEES: Increased 17%, primarily reflecting a 15% increase in worldwide travel sales. - - OTHER COMMISSIONS AND FEES: Rose 1% on higher card-related assessments and conversion revenues partially offset by a reclass to other revenues in USCS of certain card service-related fees. - - SECURITIZATION INCOME, NET: Decreased 32% primarily due to lower excess spread, net, driven by increased write-offs and the $136MM charge to the fair value of the I/O Strip, which were partially offset by higher finance charges and fees due to a greater average balance of securitized loans and lower interest expense due to lower rates paid on investor certificates. Securitization income, net represents the non-credit provision components of the gains from securitization activities within the USCS segment, fair value changes of the related I/O Strip and excess spread related to securitized loans and servicing income, net of related discounts or fees. 7
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2008 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED - Components of Securitization Income, Net: * Excess spread, net is the net positive cash flow from interest and fee collections allocated to the investors' interests after deducting the interest paid on investor certificates, credit losses, contractual servicing fees, other expenses and changes in the fair value of the I/O Strip. ** Excludes $117MM and ($71MM) of impact from cardmember loan sales and maturities in 2Q '08, as well as $32MM and ($46MM) of impact from cardmember loan sales and maturities in 2Q '07, reflected in the provisions for losses for each respective period. - The average balance of Cardmember lending securitizations was $26.0B in 2Q '08 compared with $20.2B in 2Q '07. - - OTHER REVENUES: Increased 35% primarily reflecting the benefits of the CPS acquisition, higher network and partner-related revenues, and a reclass from other commissions and fees within USCS. - - CARDMEMBER LENDING FINANCE REVENUE: Was unchanged as 9% growth in average worldwide lending balances was offset by a lower portfolio yield, due to the impact of reduced market interest rates on variably priced loans. - - OTHER INTEREST INCOME: Decreased 19%, reflecting lower rates and volumes in the Company's certificate business as well as interest income in the prior year on the Company's loan to Delta Air Lines, which was repaid in April 2007 and was previously on non-accrual status. - - CARDMEMBER LENDING INTEREST EXPENSE: Decreased 16% due to a lower cost of funds which more than offset increased borrowings related to higher lending balances. - - CHARGE CARD AND OTHER INTEREST EXPENSE: Decreased 3%, reflecting a lower cost of funds which more than offset increased receivable and liquidity-related funding levels. - - MARKETING, PROMOTION, REWARDS AND CARDMEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES: Increased 5%, reflecting higher volume-driven rewards costs, partially offset by a flat level of marketing and promotion expenses versus 2Q '07. - - HUMAN RESOURCES EXPENSE: Increased 12% due to a higher level of employees, merit increases and greater benefit-related costs. - - PROFESSIONAL SERVICES EXPENSE: Increased 5% primarily due to higher credit and collection expenses. - - OCCUPANCY AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSE: Rose 17% on higher servicing and technology-related costs. - - COMMUNICATIONS EXPENSE: Increased 3%. - - OTHER, EXPENSE NET: Decreased 21% primarily due to the $70MM payment from Visa as well as lower litigation-related expenses, partially offset by expenses related to the CPS acquisition. - - CHARGE CARD PROVISION FOR LOSSES: Increased 3%, due to business volume growth and higher write-off and delinquency rates versus last year. - WORLDWIDE CHARGE CARD:* -- The loss ratio increased versus last year and last quarter. The past due rate increased versus last year but decreased versus last quarter. * There are no off-balance sheet Charge Card securitizations.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2008 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED - - CARDMEMBER LENDING PROVISION FOR LOSSES: Increased more than 100% due to the higher write-off and delinquency rates within the U.S. portfolio and the lending reserve addition, as well as increased loan volumes. - WORLDWIDE LENDING:* -- The write-off and past due rates increased versus last year and last quarter. * All lending statistics are presented here on a GAAP or "Owned Basis". "Managed Basis" credit quality statistics are available in the Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Release on the American Express Company Consolidated Selected Statistical Information pages. ** The 6/08 owned net write-off rate was elevated partially due to an addition of $10.2B of loans to the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the "Lending Trust") on May 16, 2008. This resulted in decreased net write-off rates within the Lending Trust, and increased net write-off rates on an owned basis. The managed basis net write off rates were not affected by this addition. - - OTHER (INCLUDING INVESTMENT CERTIFICATES) PROVISION FOR LOSSES AND BENEFITS: Increased 5% reflecting additional merchant-related reserves in 2Q '08 due to the generally weaker U.S. economic conditions. 9
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2008 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY AND TOTAL ADJUSTED ASSETS During the third quarter of 2006, the Company issued $750MM of 6.80% Subordinated Debentures due 2036 ("Subordinated Debentures"), which are automatically extendable until 2066 unless certain events occur prior to that date. In connection with the Subordinated Debentures, the Company has undertaken to disclose on a quarterly basis the amount of its "tangible common equity" and "total adjusted assets", as defined in the Subordinated Debentures. The Company's consolidated "tangible common equity" amount as of the end of any fiscal quarter means the total shareholders' equity, excluding preferred stock, of the Company as reflected on its consolidated balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP as of such fiscal quarter end minus (i) intangible assets and goodwill and (ii) deferred acquisition costs, as determined in accordance with GAAP and reflected in such consolidated balance sheet. The Company's "total adjusted assets" as of the end of any fiscal quarter is calculated as the sum of (i) total consolidated assets as reflected on the Company's balance sheet minus (ii) non-securitized Cardmember lending receivables (without deduction for reserves), which are set forth on the Company's balance sheet, plus (iii) managed (i.e., securitized and non-securitized) worldwide Cardmember lending receivables as reported by the Company for such fiscal quarter. As of June 30, 2008 the Company's "tangible common equity" was $9B and its "total adjusted assets", both as defined in the Subordinated Debentures, were $164B. As of June 30, 2008 the consolidated assets, as reflected on the Company's balance sheet, were $137B. CORPORATE & OTHER - - Net expense was $7MM in 2Q '08 compared with $56MM in 1Q '08 and $85MM in 2Q '07. - 2Q '08 included: -- $43MM of after-tax income related to the Visa litigation settlement; and -- $9MM of the tax benefits related to the resolution of certain prior years' tax items. - 1Q '08 included: -- $43MM of after-tax income related to the Visa litigation settlement; -- A $68MM after-tax loss related to mark-to-market adjustments and sales within the AEIDC investment portfolio; and -- A $19MM after-tax charge (including $5MM of the reengineering costs noted below) related to the exit of certain AEB operations not sold. - The 2Q '08, 1Q '08 and 2Q '07 expense included $1MM, $10MM and $1MM after-tax of reengineering costs, respectively. 10

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2008 OVERVIEW U.S. CARD SERVICES - - DISCOUNT REVENUE, NET CARD FEES AND OTHER: Increased 4% largely due to greater billed business volumes, higher net card fees and greater travel revenues, partially offset by lower interest income due to the Company's loan to Delta Air Lines, which was repaid in April 2007. - - CARDMEMBER LENDING FINANCE REVENUE: Decreased 8% as lower yields more than offset the 6% growth in average owned lending balances, reflecting the impact of reduced market interest rates on variably priced loans. - - SECURITIZATION INCOME, NET: Decreased 32% primarily due to lower excess spread, net, driven by increased write-offs and the $136MM charge to the fair value of the I/O Strip, which were partially offset by higher finance charges and fees due to a greater average balance of securitized loans and lower interest expense due to lower rates paid on investor certificates.

The managed basis net write-off rates were not affected by this addition. 12
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2008 OVERVIEW U.S. CARD SERVICES MANAGED BASIS For USCS, the managed basis presentation assumes that there have been no off-balance sheet securitization transactions, i.e., all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the Company's balance sheets and income statements, respectively. For the managed basis presentation, revenue and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans are reflected in other commissions and fees (included in discount revenue, net card fees and other), cardmember lending finance revenue, cardmember lending interest expense and provisions for losses. On a managed basis, there is no securitization income, net, as the managed basis presentation assumes no securitization transactions have occurred. The Company presents USCS information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Management also believes that use of a managed basis presentation presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business. Irrespective of the on- and off-balance sheet funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant in evaluating the Company's performance and can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The Company does not currently securitize international loans. On a GAAP basis, revenue and expenses from securitized cardmember loans are reflected in the Company's income statements in securitization income, net, fees and commissions, and provisions for losses for cardmember lending. At the time of a securitization transaction, the securitized cardmember loans are removed from the Company's balance sheet, and the resulting gain on sale is reflected in securitization income, net as well as an impact to provision for losses (credit reserves are no longer recorded for the cardmember loans once sold). Over the life of a securitization transaction, the Company recognizes servicing fees and other net revenues (referred to as "excess spread") related to the interests sold to investors (i.e. the investors' interests). These amounts, in addition to changes in the fair value of the interest-only strips, are reflected in securitization income, net, and fees and commissions. The Company also recognizes cardmember lending finance revenue over the life of the securitization transaction related to the interest it retains (i.e. the seller's interest). At the maturity of a securitization transaction, cardmember loans on the balance sheet increase, and the impact of the incremental required loss reserves is recorded in provisions for losses. As presented, in aggregate over the life of a securitization transaction, the pretax income impact to the Company is the same whether or not the Company had securitized cardmember loans or funded these loans through other financing activities (assuming the same financing costs). The income statement classifications, however, of specific items will differ. The following information reconciles the GAAP basis presentation for certain USCS income statement line items to the managed basis presentation, where different: # Denotes variance of more than 100%. 13
