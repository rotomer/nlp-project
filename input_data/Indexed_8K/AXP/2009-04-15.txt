Regulation FD Disclosure
 
American Express Company (the "Company") is hereby furnishing below owned and managed basis delinquency and write-off statistics for the lending portfolio of its U.S. Card Services ("USCS") operating segment, for the months ended January 31, February 28 and March 31, 2009, and the three months ended March 31, 2009.  As previously stated in its reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), the Company believes that its managed basis presentation provides for the Company's investors a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the Company's U.S. cardmember lending business over time.  As the Company indicated in its 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, it expects USCS past-due loans and write-offs to rise in the first and second quarters of 2009 from 2008 levels.
 
As of and for the months ended January 31, February 28 and March 31, 2009 and the three months ended March 31, 2009

(A)
     
"Owned," a GAAP basis measurement, reflects only cardmember loans included in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
 
(B)
       
The managed basis presentation assumes that there have been no off-balance sheet securitization transactions, i.e., all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the Company's balance sheets and income statements, respectively.  The difference between the "owned basis" (GAAP) information and "managed basis" information is attributable to the effects of securitization activities.  The Company presents U.S. Card Services information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business.  Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-
securitized
 
cardmember loans and that use of a managed basis presentation presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business over time.
 
(C)
 
During March 2009 the Company sold to third parties certain cardmember loans that had been previously written-off.  The net write-off rates reported above for March 2009 and the three months ended March 31, 2009, reflect the benefit of the sale proceeds being treated as a partial recovery of such previously written-off balances.
 
The statistics presented above provide information that is additional to the data reported by the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the "Lending Trust") in its monthly Form 10-D report filed with the Commission.  The loans that have been securitized through the off-balance sheet Lending Trust do not possess identical characteristics with those of the total (, managed) portfolio of USCS loans, which reflects the aggregate of securitized and owned loans.  Thus, the reported credit performance of the Lending Trust may, on a month-to-month basis, be better or worse than the credit performance of the managed portfolio.  Reported differences may arise as a result of, among other things, differences in the mix and vintage of loans between the Lending Trust and the managed portfolio, the number of days in the reporting period covered by the Form 10-D being filed by the Lending Trust and the use of end-of-period principal loan balances to calculate write-off statistics in the Lending Trust compared to the use of average loan balances over the reporting period used in the managed statistics.  In addition, the reporting period for the managed portfolio is based on a calendar month, as compared to the reporting period covered by the Form 10-D reports for the Lending Trust, which is generally based on a monthly period typically beginning on the 25th day of each calendar month.
i.e.
 
 
Set forth below is certain information regarding the credit performance of the Lending Trust for its three most recent monthly reporting periods, as reported in its Form 10-D report filed with respect each such period.

A further description of these and other risks and uncertainties can be found in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, and the Company's other reports filed with the SEC.
