EXHIBIT 99.1 Release News Release News Release News Release News Release News [LOGO OF AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY] American Express Company 200 Vesey Street World Financial Center New York, NY 10285 Contacts: Media: Michael O'Neill - --------- 212-640-5951 mike.o'neill@aexp.com Investors/Analysts: Ronald Stovall 212-640-5574 ronald.stovall@aexp.com FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE STRESS TEST FINDS "NO CAPITAL NEED" Indicates Ability to Generate Earnings under Prolonged Adverse Conditions Company Files for Permission to Repay Government Investment New York - May 7, 2009 -- American Express said today that it has received a final report from the Federal Reserve which concludes that there would be "no capital need" under the assumptions used by the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program.(1) The assessment, or stress test, confirms the strength of the company's financial position, indicating that American Express: o had a year-end 2008 Tier One Common Risk-based ratio of 9.7 percent, one of the highest in the industry. That translates into a capital level approximately $6 billion above the regulatory benchmark of 4.0 percent. o had a year-end 2008 Tier One Risk-Based Capital ratio of 9.7 percent -- or 13.0 percent on a pro forma basis reflecting the issuance of preferred shares in January as part of the Capital Purchase Program (CPP). o would generate earnings in 2009-10 even under the `more adverse scenario' used by the regulators. "We believe our strong capital base gives us the resources to accommodate the spending needs of our creditworthy consumer, small business and corporate cardmembers," said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive officer, American Express Company. "Based on the results of the test, we have filed a request with the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Department of the Treasury to repay the $3.4 billion of preferred shares issued to the Treasury," said Mr. Chenault. In accordance with the guidance of our bank regulators, the company would be required to issue long term debt in the public markets that is not backed by government guarantees, prior to or at the time the preferred shares would be repurchased. - ------------ (1) Estimates reported by the Federal Reserve represent values for a hypothetical `what if' scenario and are not forecasts. -1-
"We've always viewed CPP as a temporary program, and we believe that repaying the investment at this time is not only in the best interest of American Express shareholders, but also good public policy," Mr. Chenault said. CPP was established last year at a time of extraordinary stress in the financial system and designed to ensure that participating banks were in a position to provide access to the credit facilities that are needed to help get the economy back on its feet. Since then, financial markets have become more stable, and American Express has made substantial progress in adapting to a very difficult economic environment. "At a time when some parts of the card industry were incurring substantial losses, the diversity of our payments businesses has allowed us to remain solidly profitable, strengthen our capital ratios and maintain our commitment to world-class customer service," said Mr. Chenault. "Moreover, we have broadened our funding activities with more than $17 billion of retail deposits outstanding and have $25 billion of excess cash and marketable securities on hand - well above our projected funding needs for the next 12 months. "While we continue to be very cautious about the economic environment, we believe that we will be able to continue authorizing credit responsibly and contribute to an economic recovery in the U.S. after repaying the CPP investment."
