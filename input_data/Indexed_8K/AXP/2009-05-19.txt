Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities In April 2009, American Express Company (the "Company") announced its intention to undertake a new companywide reengineering initiative in the second quarter of 2009 to help further reduce its operating costs in light of the uncertain economic outlook. On May 18, 2009, the Company's management committed to undertake various reengineering activities within its business units and staff groups that are expected to result in a restructuring charge in the second quarter of 2009 of approximately $180 million to $250 million pre-tax ($117 million to $163 million after tax). The reengineering activities are expected to result in the elimination of approximately 4,000 jobs, which constitutes approximately 6% of the Company's worldwide workforce. The total expected charge includes approximately $175 million to $210 million in employee severance obligations and other employee-related costs and approximately $5 million to $40 million in other costs principally relating to the termination of certain real property leases and other contracts. The reengineering activities relate principally to downsizing and reorganizing certain operations due to a contraction of some of the Company's businesses. Substantially all of the reengineering activities are expected to be completed by the end of 2009, with the remainder expected to be completed by the first half of 2010. The Company estimates that all of the severance and employee-related costs and a significant majority of the other costs will result in future cash expenditures. Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure In addition to the restructuring charge described above, the Company announced that it anticipates that the reengineering activities associated with the staffing-related portion of the charge will result in a cost benefit to the Company of approximately $175 million after all the initiatives to be undertaken in 2009 have been completed. Also, in addition to staff reductions, the Company announced that it was undertaking further reengineering initiatives, including a reduction of investment spending in marketing and business development and a reduction in other operating costs relating to expenses for consulting and other professional services, travel and general overhead, all of which are expected to result in an additional cost benefit of approximately $625 million in the aggregate. The aggregate benefits of $800 million described above, which are expected to be realized during the remainder of 2009, represent a reduction from previously planned 2009 spending levels and are in addition to the benefits tied to the reengineering plan announced in October 2008. A copy of the Company's press release announcing the reengineering activities describe above is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. -1-

The reengineering plan includes: a reduction of staffing levels, scaled back investment spending, and further cutbacks in operating costs. Elements of the program include: o A restructuring charge of approximately $180 to $250 million pre-tax ($117 to $163 million after-tax) in the second quarter. The charge is primarily associated with severance and other costs related to the elimination of approximately 4,000 jobs or about 6 percent of the company's current worldwide workforce. The reductions will occur across business units, markets and staff groups. The total benefit from these staffing decisions is expected to be approximately $175 million. o Reduced investment spending on marketing and business development. The anticipated cost benefit is approximately $500 million. Despite these cutbacks, the company plans to make substantial investments in selective growth opportunities, business building initiatives and customer service support. o A further reduction in operating costs by cutting expenses for consulting and other professional services, travel, and general overhead. These steps are expected to realize benefits of approximately $125 million. The benefits detailed above represents a reduction from previously planned 2009 spending levels and are in addition to the $1.8 billion benefits tied to the reengineering plan announced in October 2008. "While we have remained solidly profitable at a time when some parts of the card industry were incurring substantial losses, we continue to be very cautious about the economic outlook and are therefore moving forward with additional reengineering efforts to help further reduce our operating costs," said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive officer. "We believe these efforts will put us in a better position to remain profitable and free up some additional resources that will be reinvested in the business to make sure we can take competitive advantage of opportunities as the economy begins to rebound." -1-
