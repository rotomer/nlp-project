Excluding an $0.18 per share reduction from the repurchase of preferred shares discussed above, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and net income were $0.27 for the three-months ended June 30, 2009 and $0.59 and $0.58 for the six-months ended June 30, 2009, respectively. Management believes the adjusted earnings per share provides a useful metric to evaluate the ongoing operating performance of the company. -1-
New York - July 23, 2009 - American Express Company (NYSE: AXP) today reported second-quarter income from continuing operations of $342 million, down 48 percent from $660 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.09, down 84 percent from $0.56 a year ago. The per share results include a reduction of $0.18 from a repurchase of preferred shares from the U.S. Treasury Department. Excluding this impact, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.27. Net income totaled $337 million for the quarter, down 48 percent from a year ago. Per-share net income of $0.09 was down 84 percent from $0.56 a year ago, also reflecting the repurchase of preferred shares discussed above. Consolidated total revenues net of interest expense declined 18 percent to $6.1 billion, down from $7.5 billion a year ago. Consolidated provisions for losses totaled $1.6 billion compared to $1.8 billion in the year-ago period, primarily reflecting lower average cardmember receivables and loans, offset by higher write-offs and past due loans. Consolidated expenses totaled $4.1 billion, down 16 percent from $4.9 billion a year ago, reflecting in part the results of the company's reengineering initiatives. At the end of the quarter, the company's tier-one risk based capital ratio was 9.6 percent. Its tier-one common risk based ratio was also 9.6 percent, which compared favorably to the regulatory benchmark(2) of 4 percent. The company's return on average equity (ROE) was 13.2 percent, down from 31.1 percent a year ago. Return on average common equity (ROCE), which excludes the impact of preferred shares and other adjustments, was 12.0 percent, down from 30.9 percent a year ago. "We continued to deliver on our three 2009 priorities by staying liquid, staying profitable and investing selectively in key business initiatives this quarter," said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive officer. "Despite continued weakness in cardmember spending and historically high levels of loan losses, we generated $342 million of earnings from continuing operations, strengthened our capital base and further expanded our deposit gathering initiatives. "Our results benefited from successful reengineering efforts and from a diverse business model that combines the roles of card issuer, network and merchant processor." - --------------------------------- (2) The regulatory benchmark of 4 percent was used by the Federal Reserve to conduct its capital assessment during the Stress Test earlier this year. -2-
"Given the cutbacks in discretionary spending among affluent consumers, small businesses and corporations, our overall level of billed business is performing well relative to most of the other major card issuers. During June, the decline in cardmember spending moderated slightly from earlier in the quarter. "Although it is still too early to point to any sure signs of an economic recovery, the number of cardmembers who are falling behind in their payments, the volume of bankruptcy filings and the level of loan write-offs were better than we had expected. If these trends continue, we expect U.S. lending write-off rates on a managed basis(3) to be below 10 percent for the second half of the year, which is lower than the outlook we offered earlier this year. "We plan to use a significant portion of any benefits from this trend improvement on marketing and promotion, investments and other business initiatives. Our priorities include growing our charge card portfolio, and expanding our merchant business, corporate services, relationships with other banks who issue cards on our network and information management capabilities. We will also continue to focus on a premium lending strategy linked to co-brand partners around the world. "Just as in prior recessions, our aim is to be in position to gain competitive advantage once the economy begins to improve." The second quarter results included two previously disclosed items: $182 million ($118 million after-tax) of net reengineering charges and a $211 million ($135 million after-tax) gain on the sale of a portion of the company's equity holding in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). Year-ago results included a $136 million ($85 million after-tax) charge to the fair market value of the company's retained interest in securitized cardmember loans. The lower tax provision for the quarter reflected lower pretax income and the impact of recurring permanent benefits. The year-ago tax provision included a benefit of $101 million, primarily related to resolution of certain prior years' tax items. During the second quarter, the translation effects of a comparatively stronger U.S. dollar contributed to lower non-U.S. revenues, provisions and expenses. - --------------------------------- (3) The "managed basis" presentation includes on-balance sheet cardmember loans and off-balance sheet securitized cardmember loans. The difference between the "owned basis" (GAAP) information and "managed basis" information is attributable to the effects of securitization activities. The Company is not presenting estimates of owned net write-off rates comparable to the managed data above because the owned write-off rates are not determinable at this time. -3-
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Discontinued operations for the second quarter generated a loss of $5 million compared with a loss of $7 million during the year-ago period. SEGMENT RESULTS U.S. CARD SERVICES reported a second-quarter loss of $200 million, compared to a net income of $21 million a year ago. Total revenues net of interest expense for the second quarter decreased 22 percent to $2.8 billion, driven by reduced cardmember spending, lower loan balances and lower securitization income, net. Provisions for losses totaled $1.2 billion, a decrease of 22 percent from $1.5 billion a year ago. The decrease reflected lower loan receivables, which were partially offset by higher write-offs and past due loans. On a managed basis(4), the net loan write-off rate was 10.0%, up from 8.5% in the first quarter and 5.3% a year ago. Owned net write-offs were 10.3% in the quarter, up from 8.5% in the first quarter and 5.8% a year ago. Total expenses decreased 9 percent. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses decreased 18 percent from the year-ago period, reflecting reduced investments in marketing and promotion and lower rewards costs. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased 3 percent from year-ago levels. This increase reflected the unfavorable impact of fair value hedge ineffectiveness, higher deposit-related FDIC assessment costs and charges related to staff reductions. Offsetting these items were the benefits of ongoing reengineering initiatives. INTERNATIONAL CARD SERVICES reported second-quarter net income of $64 million, compared to $115 million a year ago. Total revenues net of interest expense decreased 13 percent to $1.1 billion, primarily driven by reduced cardmember spending. Provisions for losses totaled $302 million, an increase of 25 percent or $60 million from a year ago. The increase reflected higher write-offs and past due loans, offset by lower receivables and loans. Total expenses decreased 21 percent. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses decreased 29 percent from year-ago levels, reflecting reduced marketing investments and lower volume-related rewards costs. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased 16 percent from year-ago levels, primarily due to the benefits of ongoing reengineering initiatives, partially offset by charges related to staff reductions. - --------------------------------- (4) Please refer to the information set forth on Exhibit I for further discussion of the owned and managed basis presentations. -4-
GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES reported a second-quarter net income of $71 million, compared to $227 million a year ago. Total revenues net of interest expense decreased 23 percent to $1.0 billion, reflecting reduced spending by corporate cardmembers and lower travel commissions and fees. Total expenses decreased 10 percent. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses decreased 25 percent from the year-ago period, primarily reflecting lower volume-related rewards costs. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased 8 percent from the year-ago period, reflecting in part the benefits from ongoing reengineering initiatives, partially offset by charges related to staff reductions. GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES reported second-quarter net income of $236 million, down 21 percent from $299 million a year ago. Total revenues net of interest expense decreased 16 percent to $910 million, primarily reflecting lower merchant-related revenues driven by a decrease in global card billed business. Total expenses decreased 14 percent. Marketing and promotion expenses decreased 37 percent from the year-ago period, reflecting lower brand advertising and reduced investment spending in merchant services. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased 7 percent. This decrease primarily reflected the benefits of ongoing reengineering initiatives and lower merchant related reserves. Offsetting these items were lower litigation-related expenses in the year-ago quarter and charges related to staff reductions this quarter. CORPORATE AND OTHER reported a second-quarter net income of $171 million, compared with net loss of $2 million a year ago. The second quarter 2009 results reflected the recognition of $220 million ($136 million after-tax) for the previously announced MasterCard and Visa settlements compared to $70 million ($43 million after-tax) in the year-ago period related to Visa. Results also included the ICBC gain discussed previously, partially offset by reengineering charges incurred during the quarter. American Express Company is a leading global payments and travel company founded in 1850.

An investor conference call will be held at 5:00 p.m. (ET) today to discuss second-quarter earnings results.

A replay of the conference call will be available later today at the same web site address. -5-
EXHIBIT 1 (A) "Owned," a GAAP basis measurement, reflects only cardmember loans included in the company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. (B) The managed basis presentation assumes that there have been no off-balance sheet securitization transactions, i.e., all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the company's balance sheets and income statements, respectively. The difference between the "owned basis" (GAAP) information and "managed basis" information is attributable to the effects of securitization activities. The company presents U.S. Card Services information on a managed basis because that is the way the company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Management also believes that use of a managed basis presentation presents a more comprehensive portrayal of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business. Irrespective of the on and off-balance sheet funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant in evaluating the company's performance and can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The company does not currently securitize international loans. -6-

(Preliminary) AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION (Billions, except percentages and where indicated) (A) Card billed business includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements, and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards. Card billed business is reflected in the United States or outside the United States based on where the cardmember is domiciled. (B) Total cards-in-force represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding. Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner and does not include additional supplemental cards issued on that account. Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force include basic and supplemental cards issued to employee cardmembers. Non-proprietary basic cards-in-force includes all cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements. (C) This calculation is designed to approximate merchant pricing. It represents the percentage of billed business (both proprietary and Global Network Services) retained by the Company from merchants it acquires, prior to payments to third parties unrelated to merchant acceptance. (D) Average basic cardmember spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only. Average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs, plus card fees included in interest and fees on loans (including related amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs), divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force. The card fees related to cardmember loans included in interest and fees on loans were $45 million and $34 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The adjusted average fee per card is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs (a portion of which is charge card related and included in net card fees and a portion of which is lending related and included in interest and fees on loans). The amount of amortization excluded was $62 million and $82 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company presents adjusted average fee per card because management believes that this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products. -5-

(Preliminary) AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION (Billions, except percentages and where indicated) (A) Card billed business includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements, and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards. Card billed business is reflected in the United States or outside the United States based on where the cardmember is domiciled. (B) Total cards-in-force represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding. Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner and does not include additional supplemental cards issued on that account. Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force include basic and supplemental cards issued to employee cardmembers. Non-proprietary basic cards-in-force includes all cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements. (C) This calculation is designed to approximate merchant pricing. It represents the percentage of billed business (both proprietary and Global Network Services) retained by the Company from merchants it acquires, prior to payments to third parties unrelated to merchant acceptance. (D) Average basic cardmember spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only. Average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs, plus card fees included in interest and fees on loans (including related amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs), divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force. The card fees related to cardmember loans included in interest and fees on loans were $45 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, $40 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2009, $41 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2008, $35 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2008, and $34 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, respectively. The adjusted average fee per card is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs (a portion of which is charge card related and included in net card fees and a portion of which is lending related and included in interest and fees on loans). The amount of amortization excluded for these periods was $62 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, $70 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2009, $76 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2008, $84 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2008, and $82 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, respectively. The Company presents adjusted average fee per card because management believes that this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products. -10-
(Preliminary) AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED) (Billions, except percentages and where indicated) (A) In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company revised the time period in which past due cardmember receivables in U.S. Card Services are written off to 180 days past due, consistent with applicable regulatory guidance. Previously, receivables were written off when 360 days past due. The net write-offs for the fourth quarter of 2008 include write-offs of $341 million resulting from this write-off methodology change, which is not reflected in the net write-off rate for U.S. Card Services. Including the $341 million in write-offs, the net write-off rate was 11.0 percent for the fourth quarter of 2008. (B) "Owned," a GAAP basis measurement, reflects only cardmember loans included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. (C) For the quarter ended June 30, 2009, this amount primarily includes $144 million of reserves that were removed in connection with securitizations during the period. The offset is in the allocated cost of the associated retained subordinated securities. This amount also includes foreign currency translation adjustments. Prior periods included foreign currency translation and other adjustments primarily related to the reclassification of waived fee reserves to a contra-cardmember receivable. (D) See Appendix III for discussion of net interest yield on cardmember loans. (E) Includes on-balance sheet cardmember loans and off-balance sheet securitized cardmember loans. The difference between the "owned basis" (GAAP) information and "managed basis" information is attributable to the effects of securitization activities. Refer to the information set forth under U.S. Card Services Selected Financial Information for further discussion of the managed basis presentation. -11-

(Preliminary) U.S. CARD SERVICES SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION MANAGED BASIS PRESENTATION (Millions) # - Denotes a variance of more than 100%. For U.S. Card Services, the managed basis presentation assumes that there have been no off-balance sheet securitization transactions, i.e., all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the Company's balance sheets and income statements, respectively. For the managed basis presentation, revenue and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans are reflected in other commissions and fees (included above in discount revenue, net card fees and other), interest income, interest expense, and provisions for losses. On a managed basis, there is no securitization income, net as the managed basis presentation assumes no securitization transactions have occurred. The Company presents U.S. Card Services information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Management also believes that use of a managed basis presentation presents a more comprehensive portrayal of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business. Irrespective of the on and off-balance sheet funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant in evaluating the Company's performance and can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The Company does not currently securitize international loans. -13-

EXHIBIT 99.3 [LOGO OF AMERICAN EXPRESS(R)] 2009 Second Quarter Earnings Supplement The enclosed summary should be read in conjunction with the text and statistical tables included in American Express Company's (the "Company" or "AXP") Second Quarter 2009 Earnings Release. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This presentation contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of the date on which they are made. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, including the Company's financial and other goals, are set forth on page 23 of this Supplement, pages 59-61 in the Company's 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders and in its 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and other reports, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2009 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS .. Second quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders of $0.09 decreased 84% versus $0.56 last year. Total revenues net of interest expense decreased 18%. Return on average common equity ("ROCE") was 12.0% and return on average tangible common equity ("ROTCE"), which excludes goodwill and intangibles, was 15.6%.[Footnote 1] . 2Q '09 Income from continuing operations included: . A $211MM ($135MM after-tax) gain on the sale of 50% of the Company's equity holdings of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China ("ICBC"), as discussed further on page 5; and . $182MM ($118MM after-tax) of net reengineering costs, primarily reflecting a restructuring charge related to the Company's ongoing reengineering initiatives, as discussed further on pages 4-5. . Additionally, as per GAAP accounting requirements, the 2Q '09 EPS from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders was negatively impacted by $0.18 per share as a result of the accelerated accretion of the dividends on the preferred shares repurchased from the United States Department of the Treasury ("The Treasury") under the terms of the Capital Purchase Program ("CPP"), as discussed further on pages 2-3. . Excluding the impact of the accelerated accretion, adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders would have been $0.27. . 2Q '08 Income from continuing operations included: . A $136MM ($85MM after-tax) charge to the fair market value of the Company's interest-only strip ("I/O Strip"); and . $7MM ($4MM after-tax) of reengineering costs. . The discontinued operations line in the Consolidated Financial Statements contains the results of operations, assets and liabilities related to various business sales. This primarily includes the results from American Express International Deposit Company ("AEIDC"), which is expected to be transferred to Standard Chartered PLC ("Standard Chartered") through a put/call agreement in 3Q '09, as well as American Express Bank, Ltd. ("AEB"), which was sold to Standard Chartered in 1Q '08, as discussed further on page 5. . 2Q '09 results included $5MM of losses from discontinued operations versus $7MM of losses last year. . Including discontinued operations, diluted EPS on a net income basis attributable to common shareholders of $0.09 decreased 84% versus $0.56 last year. BUSINESS METRICS .. Compared with the second quarter of 2008: . Worldwide billed business of $151.4B decreased 16% as the negative impact of the global economic slowdown was evident within a lower level of card spending. A comparatively stronger U.S. dollar resulted in a 3% greater decline versus last year within the reported worldwide growth rate. . Worldwide total cards-in-force of 88.5MM decreased 2%, or 1.6MM, from 2Q '08 and decreased 3%, or 3.1MM, from 1Q '09. As part of an ongoing strategy to mitigate credit risk, approximately 2.7MM inactive cards were cancelled during the quarter, with 2.6MM in U.S. Card Services ("USCS") and approximately 60K within International Card Services ("ICS"). The impact versus last year was partially offset by the migration of cards from GE's commercial card and corporate purchasing unit, Corporate Payment Services ("CPS"), to the American Express network primarily in 1Q '09. . Worldwide average spending per proprietary basic cards-in-force decreased 15% versus last year reflecting the impact of the weaker economic environment in both the U.S. and international markets, which was partially offset by the effect of the inactive card cancellations referenced above. A comparatively stronger U.S. dollar resulted in a 3% greater decline versus last year within the reported average spending growth rate. . Worldwide owned cardmember lending balances of $32.5B decreased 34% from last year. On a managed basis, including securitized loans, cardmember lending balances of $62.9B declined 18%. These decreases reflected lower cardmember spending levels and the Company's credit-related actions in the U.S. and certain international markets. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS .. Net Income Attributable To Common Shareholders: Income from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders of $107MM and net income attributable to common shareholders of $102MM both include the impacts of the preferred shares dividends and related accretion, including the accelerated accretion upon repayment of the preferred shares referenced above, and earnings allocated to participating share awards discussed below. . Preferred Shares Dividends and Related Accretion: In 2Q '09, the Company recorded $22MM of dividends and related accretion on the preferred shares issued to the Treasury as part of its participation in the CPP, as discussed further on pages 2-3. . Earnings Allocated to Participating Share Awards: In accordance with the adoption of FSP EITF 03-6-1, income attributable to unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (e.g. Restricted Stock Awards) is included in the computation of basic and diluted EPS, pursuant to the two class method. This new accounting standard was retroactively applied to all prior periods beginning in 1Q '09. Under this method earnings allocated to participating shares awards were $1MM in 2Q '09 versus $3MM in 2Q '08. - ---------- [FOOTNOTE 1] Please refer to Appendix I of the Second Quarter 2009 Earnings Release for the components of return on average equity ("ROE"), ROCE and ROTCE on a consolidated basis and Appendix II for return on average segment capital ("ROSC") and return on average tangible segment capital ("ROTSC") on a segment basis. 1
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2009 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED .. Securitization Income, Net: Decreased to ($2MM) versus $227MM in 2Q '08 primarily due to lower excess spread, net, driven by increased write-offs, partially offset by the 2Q '08 charge to the fair value of the I/O Strip and lower interest expense due to lower rates paid on variable-rate investor certificates. Securitization income, net represents the non-credit provision components of the gains from securitization activities within the USCS segment, fair value changes of the related I/O Strip and excess spread related to securitized loans and servicing income, net of related discounts or fees. As of June 30, 2009, the fair market value of the I/O Strip was $0 versus $136MM as of June 30, 2008. .. Total Interest Income: Decreased 31%, due to lower interest and fees on loans, primarily reflecting a lower average owned loan balance, as well as lower yields on investment deposits and securities, partially offset by a higher average balance of liquidity-related investments. .. Total Interest Expense: Decreased 39%, primarily reflecting a lower cost of funds due to the benefit of lower market interest rates on variable-rate long-term and short-term debt, as well as lower average balances of short-term borrowings. .. Total Provisions for Losses: Decreased 13%, primarily reflecting lower owned lending balances, partially offset by higher cardmember lending reserve levels due to increased net write-off and past due loan levels. Cardmember lending loss reserves of $3.2B increased $206MM in the quarter. . USCS lending net write-off rates for 2Q '09 were better than previously forecasted, primarily due to lower than expected cardmember bankruptcy levels. Assuming delinquencies continue around current levels and bankruptcies increase somewhat, the Company believes that it is highly likely that its USCS managed lending net write-off rates for 3Q '09 and 4Q '09 will be less than 10%. If these circumstances occur, the Company would expect to utilize a significant portion of the provision for losses benefit resulting from better than forecasted credit performance on selective investments and other business initiatives during 3Q '09 and 4Q '09.[FOOTNOTE 2] .. Marketing and Promotion Expenses: Decreased 47%, reflecting lower discretionary investment spending due to the Company's ongoing reengineering initiatives. .. Cardmember Rewards Expense: Decreased 9%, primarily reflecting lower overall rewards-related spending volumes, partially offset by a slightly higher Membership Rewards redemption rate and a relatively lower decline in co-brand spending volumes. .. Salaries and Employee Benefits Expense: Decreased 8%, reflecting lower employee levels due to the Company's ongoing reengineering initiatives and reduced incentive-related costs, partially offset by the $154MM of net severance-related costs, as discussed further on pages 4-5. . Compared with last year, the total employee count from continuing operations of 60,700 decreased by 5,800 employees, or 9%. Compared with last quarter, the employee count declined by 2,900 employees, or 5%. .. Segment Interest Expense Allocations: Beginning 1Q '09, the Company changed the manner in which it assesses the performance of its reportable operating segments to exclude the impact of its excess liquidity funding levels. Accordingly, the debt and related cash/investment balances associated with the Company's excess liquidity funding and the related net negative interest spread are no longer included within the reportable operating segment results (primarily within USCS and Global Commercial Services, or "GCS") and are now being reported in the Corporate & Other segment. The segment results for quarters prior to 1Q '09 have not been revised for this change. CAPITAL .. CPP, Supervisory Capital Assistance Program and Equity Issuance: On January 9, 2009, the Company issued to the Treasury $3.39B of preferred shares, as well as warrants to purchase common shares for up to 15% of that amount, or 24.3MM shares, at a per share exercise price of $20.95. The preferred shares paid dividends at a rate of 5% annually for five years, and 9% thereafter. The warrants have a 10 year term. In 1Q '09, these preferred shares and warrants were recorded in the equity section in the Company's balance sheet at $3.16B and $232MM, respectively, based on the relative fair value of each component when issued. The value of the preferred shares was scheduled to accrete to the face value of $3.39B over five years. On February 25, 2009, the Treasury released the terms of the Supervisory Capital Assistance Program ("SCAP"). Under SCAP, federal banking supervisors conducted assessments to evaluate the capital needs of the major U.S. banking institutions under a base case and more adverse economic scenario. The Company and all other eligible banking institutions with assets in excess of $100B as of December 31, 2008 participated in this assessment. On May 7, 2009, the Company received a final report from the Federal Reserve concluding that there would be "no capital need" under the more adverse economic assumptions modeled in the SCAP. In accordance with guidance from bank regulators and as a pre-condition to the repurchase of the preferred shares issued to the Treasury under the CPP, the Company was required to issue long-term debt that was not backed by government guarantees, and common equity, in the public markets. Accordingly, on May 18, 2009, the Company completed the sale of $3.0B of non-guaranteed senior debt. On June 5, the Company closed on a $500MM public offering of its common stock through the issuance of 19.8MM common shares at a price of $25.25 per share. The underwriters retained a 30-day option to purchase 3.0MM additional shares. On June 10, the underwriters exercised that option and the Company issued an incremental 1.9MM common shares. - ---------------------------------- [FOOTNOTE 2] The "managed basis" presentation includes on-balance sheet cardmember loans and off-balance sheet securitized cardmember loans. The difference between the "owned basis" (GAAP) information and "managed basis" information is attributable to the effects of securitization activities. The Company is not presenting estimates of owned net write-off rates comparable to the managed data above because the owned write-off rates are not determinable at this time. See the Forward-Looking Statements on page 23 for certain risk factors relating to the estimated net write-off rates above. 2
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2009 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED On June 9, 2009, the Company announced that it had received notification from the Treasury that it had met all of the requirements to repurchase the CPP preferred shares, and completed this purchase on June 17, 2009. Upon repurchase, the accretion to face value of the preferred shares was accelerated, amounting to a one-time negative EPS impact during the quarter of $212MM, or $0.18 per basic and diluted common share. The Company also recorded $13MM in preferred shares dividends in 2Q '09, as well as $9MM related to the accretion of the preferred shares, for the period ended June 17, 2009 when the shares were repurchased, which further reduced 2Q '09 diluted EPS by approximately $0.02 per share. On July 1, the Company submitted notice to the Treasury of its intent to repurchase the warrants issued under the CPP program, including the Company's determination of fair market value. Discussions regarding this request are ongoing. .. Capital Distribution to Shareholders: During 2Q '09, approximately 151% of capital generated was distributed to shareholders through our quarterly common share dividend, as earnings were suppressed by the challenging economic environment and capital generation was reduced by the preferred share dividends and related accelerated accretion. On a cumulative basis, since 1994 the Company has distributed 69% of capital generated through share repurchases and dividends. . Shares Outstanding and Repurchase Activity: Total shares outstanding increased by 21MM during 2Q '09 primarily reflecting the impact of the common share equity issuance. No shares have been repurchased over the past four quarters, as share repurchases were suspended during 1Q '08 in light of the challenging global economic environment and limitations under the CPP. Since the inception of repurchase programs in December 1994, 670MM shares have been acquired under cumulative Board authorizations to repurchase up to 770MM shares. .. Capital Ratios:[FOOTNOTE 3] On May 22, 2009, the Company announced modifications to the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the "Master Trust"). For additional information regarding these modifications to the Master Trust, refer to page 5. Beginning in 2Q '09, these actions result in the inclusion of the Master Trust's assets as risk-weighted assets for regulatory capital purposes. As of June 30, 2009, the Company's key consolidated capital ratios were as follows: Additionally, the Company also believes that its Tangible Common Equity to Risk Weighted Assets ("TCE/RWA") and Tier 1 Common Equity to Risk Weighted Assets ratios provide further insight into the strength of its capital position. As of June 30, 2009, these ratios were 9.1% and 9.6%, respectively. On a pro forma basis, assuming recognition of corresponding reserves per the proposed amendments to SFAS 140, these ratios would be 7.6% and 8.1%, respectively.[FOOTNOTE 5] FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY .. Funding Sources: The Company currently has an objective to hold excess cash and readily marketable securities to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund normal business operations for in excess of a 12-month period, in addition to having access to significant additional contingent liquidity sources, in the event that access to its traditional secured and unsecured funding sources should become unavailable. As of June 30, 2009, the Company held $22B of excess cash and readily marketable securities on its balance sheet. The Company expects that brokered and direct retail deposits will be its primary funding source for the remainder of 2009. The Company offers brokered deposits within its American Express Centurion Bank and American Express Bank, FSB subsidiaries (together, the "Banks"). These funds are insured up to $250,000 through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). In addition, the Company launched its direct deposit-taking program, Personal Savings from American Express, during 2Q '09. This program makes FDIC-insured certificates of deposit ("CDs") and high-yield savings account products available directly from American Express Bank, FSB to consumers and further extends its funding capabilities beyond the brokered retail CD and sweep account programs utilized prior to 2Q '09. - ---------- [FOOTNOTE 3] These ratios represent a preliminary estimate as of the date of this Earnings Supplement and may be revised in the Company's Second Quarter 2009 Form 10-Q. [FOOTNOTE 4] For the purpose of calculating the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio. [FOOTNOTE 5] Based upon common shareholders' equity of $13.4B, less goodwill and intangibles of $3.0B, which represents TCE; Tier One Common Equity of $11.0B; and Risk Weighted Assets of $114.4B. Pro forma for SFAS 140 assumes the recognition of corresponding reserves and other adjustments, which would result in TCE, Tier 1 Common Equity and Risk Weighted Assets all decreasing by $1.9B. 3
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2009 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED On March 3, 2009, the Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board announced the launch of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility ("TALF"). Securitized credit and charge card receivables are eligible collateral under the TALF, provided the securities qualify for AAA ratings from two or more major nationally recognized statistical rating organizations ("NRSROs"). The Company believes that during 2009 it can issue up to $9.8B of securities backed by its cardmember loans or receivables that would be eligible under this program, and on June 9, 2009, issued $1.0B in TALF-eligible Class A securities, as discussed further below. In addition to deposit, unsecured and asset-backed funding, the Company can draw upon various other funding sources: . TLGP: Under the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program ("TLGP"), the Banks, as FDIC depository institutions, can issue up to $13.3B of senior unsecured guaranteed debt. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Banks issued $5.9B of securities under this facility. Issuance under the TLGP is currently scheduled to expire October 31, 2009. . Commercial Paper: The Company had continuous access to the commercial paper market throughout the quarter. In addition, the Commercial Paper Financial Facility ("CPFF") became operational on October 27, 2008, and is currently set to expire on February 1, 2010. Through its subsidiary, American Express Credit Corporation ("Credco"), the Company is eligible to have up to $14.7B of commercial paper outstanding through the CPFF. The commercial paper must be rated at least A1/P1/F1 by two or more major NRSROs to qualify for participation in the CPFF. At June 30, 2009, the Company had $1.4B of commercial paper outstanding, none of which was placed with the CPFF. . Discount Window: The Banks are insured depository institutions that have the capability of borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (i.e., access to the Federal Reserve Bank discount window), subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that they pledge. The Federal Reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window or its Term Auction Facility (TAF) program. . Bank Lines: At June 30, 2009, the Company maintained committed bank lines of credit totaling $11.7B, of which $2.9B was drawn as part of the Company's normal non-U.S. funding activities. The committed facilities have $2.0B of expirations in 2010 and $3.3B in 2011, with the remainder expiring in 2012. .. Funding Activities: During 2Q `09, the Company funded its business through payments received from customers on contracting loan and receivable balances, its deposit-taking activities within the Banks, asset-backed securitization activities under TALF, unsecured non-guaranteed debt issuance, as well as the previously mentioned common equity offering. - Deposits: As of June 30, 2009, the Company has accumulated $20.1B of funding through customer retail and institutional deposits, a net increase of $2.0B from 1Q `09. The Company has accumulated $11.8B through its brokered retail CD program launched in October 2008, a net increase of $2.5B from 1Q `09. The average duration and rate on the outstanding brokered deposits was 26 months and 2.6%, respectively. Through offering retail deposits to sweep account holders at selected broker-dealer networks, the Company had a total of $7.1B outstanding at the end of 2Q `09, which was $0.4B lower than the 1Q `09 level. Institutional and other deposits remained relatively flat in the period. - TALF-eligible ABS: As previously mentioned, on June 9, 2009, the Company issued $1.0B in TALF-eligible, Class A securities, priced at one-month LIBOR plus 135bps. In addition, the Company issued and retained $212MM of subordinated securities related to this transaction. - Unsecured non-guaranteed debt: During 2Q `09, the Company issued $3.0B of unsecured, non-guaranteed debt which included $1.25B of 5-year notes with a coupon of 7.25% and $1.75B of 10-year notes with a coupon of 8.125%. .. Funding Requirements: The maturities of the Company's long-term debt, debt issued in connection with off-balance sheet securitizations and long-term CDs for the following four quarters are as follows: The Company's projected needs within its current funding plan is lower than these debt maturities primarily due to the anticipated continuation of lower spending and credit-related actions which may reduce the Company's cardmember receivables and loan balances over this period. OTHER ITEMS OF NOTE .. Reengineering Initiatives: On October 30, 2008, the Company announced various reengineering initiatives which were expected to produce cost benefits of approximately $1.8B in 2009 from previously anticipated spending levels. These initiatives include: reducing staffing levels and compensation expenses (expected benefit of $700MM in 2009), reducing certain operating costs (expected benefit of $125MM in 2009) and scaling back investment spending (expected benefit of $1B in 2009). The Company 4
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2009 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED began the execution and implementation of these initiatives in 4Q '08, and as such, recorded a 4Q '08 restructuring charge of $404MM ($262MM after-tax) in continuing operations, primarily associated with severance and other costs related to the elimination of approximately 7,000 jobs. On May 18, 2009, the Company announced another phase of reengineering initiatives which were expected to produce incremental cost benefits of approximately $0.8B in 2009. These initiatives include: reducing staffing levels and compensation expenses, (expected benefit of $175MM in 2009), scaling back investment spending on marketing and business development (expected benefit of $500MM in 2009) and cutting certain professional services, travel and general overhead expenses (expected benefit of $125MM in 2009). The Company began to implement these initiatives in 2Q '09, and as such, recorded a 2Q '09 net reengineering charge of $182MM ($118MM after-tax) in continuing operations, primarily associated with severance and other costs related to the elimination of approximately 4,000 jobs. Cumulatively through these reengineering initiatives, the Company is expecting to eliminate approximately 11,000 jobs, which accounts for approximately 17% of its global workforce as of September 30, 2008. While the Company believes it is on track to realize the total projected benefits associated with these reengineering initiatives over the course of 2009, the better than expected credit trends discussed earlier will likely lead to increased investment spending and, therefore, reduce the net benefits realized. .. ICBC Sale: On April 28, 2009, the Company announced that it divested 50% of its investment in ICBC, or 638MM of ICBC's Class H shares, through a private sale. The Company had previously acquired its interest in 2006 and, per the agreement with ICBC, was not permitted to sell any portion of this investment prior to the date of this sale. The agreement allowed the Company to divest its stake in two 50% increments, with the remaining shares eligible to be sold after October 20, 2009. The Company realized a $211MM ($135MM after-tax) gain from the sale, which was reported in the "other revenues" line within the Corporate & Other segment. .. Master Trust Modifications: On May 22, 2009, the Company announced its plans to take certain actions which would benefit the outstanding investor certificates of the American Express Credit Account Master Trust ("Master Trust") and the related American Express Credit Account Secured Note Trusts (the "Note Trusts"). These actions consisted of the issuance of two new series of asset-backed securities totaling $1.5B, which provide additional credit enhancement to all existing outstanding series, and the exercise of a discount option with respect to new principal receivables arising in the Master Trust. In addition to improving the levels of credit enhancement for existing series of securities issued by the Master Trust and the Note Trusts, these actions will increase the yield (or trust excess spread rate) on assets in the Master Trust by 400-600 basis points beginning with the July monthly period. The Master Trust modifications had no impact on the 2Q '09 Consolidated Income Statement. Within the 2Q '09 Consolidated Balance Sheet, $1.5B of owned cardmember loans less associated reserves have been transferred to retained subordinated securities within investment securities. In addition, the Master Trust's assets are now included within risk-weighted assets for regulatory capital purposes. .. Visa and MasterCard Litigation Settlements: In November of 2004, the Company filed suit against Visa Inc., Visa USA and Visa International (collectively "Visa"), MasterCard Inc. ("MasterCard") and certain of their member banks to seek monetary damages for the lost business opportunity that resulted from the illegal conspiracy to boycott American Express from partnering with U.S. credit card issuing banks. The Company announced that it had reached an agreement with Visa on November 7, 2007 and with MasterCard on June 25, 2008. All defendants were removed and the case was dismissed. Under the terms of the settlement agreements, the Company will receive aggregate maximum payments of up to $2.25B from Visa and $1.8B from MasterCard. The settlement with Visa is comprised of an initial payment of $1.13B ($700MM after-tax) that was recorded in 4Q '07 and received in March 2008, and quarterly payments of up to $70MM ($43MM after-tax) for four years from 1Q '08 through 4Q '11. The settlement with MasterCard is comprised of quarterly payments of up to $150MM ($93MM after-tax) for three years from 3Q '08 through 2Q '11. The Company recognized $70MM from Visa for each of the past six quarters and $150MM from MasterCard for each of the past four quarters pursuant to these agreements. The installment payments from both parties are subject to the Company achieving certain quarterly performance criteria in the Global Network Services ("GNS") business within the U.S., which the Company believes it is positioned to meet. Payments earned through June 2009 have been recorded as a reduction to the "other, net" expense line within the Corporate & Other segment. Acquisition of CPS: On March 28, 2008, the Company completed its purchase of CPS for $1.1B in cash and the repayment of $1.2B in CPS debt. The purchase included card relationships with GE, as well as more than 300 large corporate clients, which cumulatively generated over $14B in global purchase volume in 2007. As of March 31, 2009, the GE commercial card relationships that have agreed to become GCS clients have migrated to the AXP network as the Company issues commercial cards to their employees. Therefore, the cards issued and spending related to these relationships are now recorded as "cards-in-force" and "billed business", and the associated receivables are reflected in the "cardmember receivables" line. In addition, where applicable, CPS revenues and expenses that were previously reported in "other revenues" and "other, net expense" are now reported in the relevant revenue and expense line items. AEB and AEIDC: On September 18, 2007, the Company announced that it entered into an agreement to sell AEB, its international banking subsidiary, and AEIDC, a subsidiary that issues investment certificates to AEB's customers, to Standard Chartered. On February 29, 2008, Standard Chartered completed its purchase of the AEB portion of this transaction. In 2Q '08, the Company and Standard Chartered agreed on the final purchase price of $796MM, equaling the final net asset value of the businesses that were sold plus $300MM. The AEIDC portion of the transaction is expected to be transferred to Standard Chartered through a put/call agreement in 3Q '09. Therefore, for all periods presented, the AEB and AEIDC results, assets and liabilities are reported within Discontinued Operations on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 5

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2009 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED (Preliminary) Statements of Income (GAAP basis) # Denotes variance of more than 100%. (A) Represents income from continuing operations or net income, as applicable, less (i) accelerated preferred dividend accretion of $212MM for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 due to the repurchase of $3.39B of the preferred shares issued as part of the CPP, (ii) preferred shares dividends and related accretion of $22MM for 2Q '09 and (iii) earnings allocated to participating share awards of $1MM and $3MM for 2Q '09 and 2Q '08, respectively. 7
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2009 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED .. Consolidated Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense: Consolidated total revenues net of interest expense decreased 18%, reflecting decreases versus last year of 22% in USCS, 13% in ICS, 23% in GCS and 16% in Global Network & Merchant Services ("GNMS"). Total revenues net of interest expense decreased due to lower discount revenues, lower total interest income, reduced securitization income, net, lower travel commissions and fees, reduced other commissions and fees and lower net card fees, partially offset by lower total interest expense and higher other revenues. Translation of foreign currency resulted in a 4% greater decline in the reported revenues net of interest expense growth rate. .. Consolidated Provisions for Losses: Consolidated provisions for losses decreased 13% versus last year, reflecting a decrease of 22% in USCS and increases of 25% in ICS, 33% in GCS and 27% in GNMS. The provision decreased primarily due to the impact of lower average owned loan balances, partially offset by higher cardmember lending reserve levels due to increased net write-off and past due loan levels. Translation of foreign currency reduced the reported consolidated provisions for losses growth rate by approximately 2%. .. Consolidated Expenses: Consolidated expenses decreased 16%, reflecting decreases of 9% in USCS, 21% in ICS, 10% in GCS and 14% in GNMS. The total expense decline reflected decreased marketing and promotion expenses, lower other, net expenses, reduced salaries and employee benefits expense, lower cardmember rewards expenses, lower occupancy and equipment expenses, decreased communications costs and reduced professional services and cardmember services expenses. Translation of foreign currency resulted in a 4% greater decline in the reported consolidated expenses growth rate. .. Pre-Tax Margin: Was 6.9% of total revenues net of interest expense in 2Q '09 compared with 10.4% in 2Q '08. .. Effective Tax Rate: Was 18% in 2Q '09 versus 15% in 2Q '08. Each of the periods reflects the impact of recurring permanent tax benefits on a relatively low level of pre-tax income. In addition, the 2Q '08 tax rate also reflects a $101MM tax benefit related to the resolution of certain prior years' tax items. .. Discount Revenue: Decreased 17%, on a 16% decrease in billed business. The greater revenue versus billed business decline primarily reflects the relatively faster growth in billed business related to GNS, where we share discount revenue with our card issuing partners. . The average discount rate* was 2.55% in 2Q '09 versus 2.56% in 1Q '09 and 2Q '08. As indicated in prior quarters, selective re-pricing initiatives, changes in the mix of business and volume-related pricing discounts will likely result in some erosion of the average discount rate over time. * For additional information about billed business and discount rate calculations, please refer to the Second Quarter 2009 Earnings Release, American Express Company Selected Statistical Information pages. ** Proprietary card activity only. 8
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2009 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED . Worldwide Billed Business: The 16% decrease in worldwide billed business reflected decreases of 16% in USCS, 20% in ICS, 23% in GCS and 3% in GNS. The table below summarizes selected billed business related statistics for 2Q '09: * Captions not designated as "proprietary" include both proprietary and GNS data. ** Included in USCS. *** Included in GCS. **** Included in ICS. . U.S. non-T&E-related volume categories (which represented approximately 71% of total U.S. billed business) declined 12%, while T&E volumes declined 20%. . U.S. airline-related volume, which represented approximately 9% of total U.S. volumes during the quarter, decreased 28% due to a 29% decrease in the average airline charge partially offset a 2% increase in airline transactions. . Worldwide airline volumes, which represented approximately 10% of total volumes during the quarter, decreased 32% due to a 29% decrease in the average airline charge and a 4% decline in airline transactions. . Assuming no changes in foreign exchange rates: Total billed business outside the U.S. reflected relatively flat volume levels in Asia Pacific and Latin America, and low double-digit declines in Canada and Europe. . Total cards-in-force: Declined 2% worldwide due to decreases of 9% in USCS and 5% in ICS, partially offset by increases of 3% in GCS and 13% in GNS. The declines in USCS and ICS reflect the effect of certain credit-related actions, including the cancellation of approximately 2.7MM inactive consumer and small business cards in the quarter as well as more modest card acquisition activities. The increase in GCS was driven by the migration of CPS cards to the American Express network. . During the quarter total cards-in-force declined 3.6MM in the U.S., driven by the 2.6MM of inactive card cancellations in USCS. International cards increased by 500K, including approximately 60K inactive card cancellations in ICS. .. Net Card Fees: Decreased 2% as the decline in total proprietary cards-in-force more than offset a slight increase in the average fee per card. .. Travel Commissions and Fees: Decreased 29%, primarily reflecting a 39% decrease in worldwide travel sales, partly offset by a higher sales commission rate. .. Other Commissions and Fees: Decreased 26%, driven primarily by lower delinquency fees related to lower average owned loan balances and reduced spending-related foreign currency conversion revenues. .. Securitization Income, Net: Decreased to ($2MM) from $227MM in 2Q '08, primarily due to lower excess spread, net, driven by increased write-offs, partially offset by the 2Q '08 charge to the fair value of the I/O Strip and lower interest expense due to lower rates paid on variable-rate investor certificates. Securitization income, net represents the non-credit provision components of the gains from securitization activities within the USCS segment, fair value changes of the related I/O Strip and excess spread related to securitized loans and servicing income, net of related discounts or fees. 9
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2009 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED . Components of Securitization Income, Net: # Denotes variance of more than 100%. * Excess spread, net is the net cash flow from interest and fee collections allocated to the investors' interests after deducting the interest paid on investor certificates, credit losses, contractual servicing fees, other expenses and changes in the fair value of the I/O Strip. ** Excludes $82MM and ($48MM) of impact from cardmember loan sales and maturities in 2Q '09 and $117MM and ($71MM) of impact from cardmember loan sales and maturities in 2Q '08, which are reflected in provisions for losses for each respective period. . The average balance of cardmember lending securitizations was $28.0B in 2Q '09 compared with $26.0B in 2Q '08. .. Other Revenues: Increased 16%, primarily reflecting the ICBC gain, partially offset by lower revenues from the CPS acquisition versus 2Q '08 due to the migration of clients to the AXP network. .. Total Interest Income: Decreased 31%. . Interest and Fees on Loans: Decreased 31%, due to a 29% decline in the average owned loan balance and a lower portfolio yield, driven by reduced market interest rates and the impact of various customer assistance programs, partially offset by the benefits of certain repricing initiatives. . Interest and Dividends on Investment Securities: Decreased 10%, primarily reflecting reduced investment yields which more than offset increased liquidity-related investment levels. . Deposits with Banks and Others: Was $11MM versus $76MM in 2Q '08 primarily due to a lower balance of deposits in other banks. .. Total Interest Expense: Decreased 39%. . Deposits: Decreased 15%, due to a lower cost of funds which more than offset increased balances. . Short-term Borrowings: Decreased 95%, due to significantly lower short-term debt levels and a lower cost of funds. . Long-term Debt: Decreased 32%, primarily reflecting a lower cost of funds driven by reduced market rates on variably-priced debt, as well as a slightly lower average balance of long-term debt outstanding. . Other: Decreased $9MM. .. Charge Card Provision for Losses: Decreased 2% or $4MM, as lower business volumes and receivable levels in 2Q '09 more than offset the impact of higher losses. . Worldwide Charge Card:* . The write-off rates increased versus last year and last quarter. Past due rates were lower versus last quarter and mixed versus last year. * There are no off-balance sheet Charge Card securitizations. Therefore, all credit quality statistics for the Charge Card portfolio are on an "Owned Basis." + In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company revised the time period in which past due cardmember receivables in USCS are written off to 180 days past due, consistent with applicable regulatory guidance. Previously, receivables were written off when 360 days past due. 10

Other Provision for Losses: Decreased $2MM versus last year .. Marketing and Promotion Expenses: Decreased 47%, reflecting lower discretionary investment spending. ..

Cardmember Services Expenses: Decreased $1MM. .. Salaries and Employee Benefits Expense: Decreased 8%, reflecting the impact of lower employee levels due to the benefits from the Company's ongoing reengineering activities and reduced incentive-related costs, partially offset by the $154MM of 2Q '09 net severance-related costs. .. Professional Services Expense: Decreased 1%. .. Occupancy and Equipment Expense: Decreased 5%, on lower technology-related expenses which more than offset costs related to the Company's reengineering initiatives. .. Communications Expense: Decreased 8%, driven by lower volume-related costs. .. Other, Net Expense: Decreased 64%, reflecting the $150MM 2Q '09 settlement payment from MasterCard, lower travel and entertainment expenses as part of the Company's ongoing reengineering activities and a $59MM benefit from the completion of certain account reconciliations, related to prior periods partially offset by a $61MM unfavorable impact related to fair value hedge ineffectiveness. 11

Billed Business: The 16% decrease in billed business reflects lower average spending per proprietary basic cards-in-force and the reduced basic cards-in-force level. . Within the U.S. consumer business, billed business decreased 16%; small business volumes declined by 17%. . Total cards-in-force: Decreased by 4.0MM, or 9%, versus last year, reflecting the effects of certain credit-related actions, including the cancellation of approximately 2.6MM inactive accounts in the quarter, as well as reduced card acquisition activities. P&L Discussion: .. Segment Results: Reflected a loss of $200MM this year versus income of $21MM last year. Total revenues net of interest expense declined 22%, provisions for losses decreased 22% and expenses declined by 9%. . 2Q '09 included $18MM ($12MM after-tax) of the net costs related to the Company's ongoing reengineering initiatives. . 2Q '08 included the $136MM ($85MM after-tax) charge to the fair market value of the I/O Strip. .

Discount Revenue, Net Card Fees and Other: Decreased 16%, due to lower billed business volumes, reduced other commissions and fees, decreased travel commissions and fees, lower other revenues and slightly lower net card fees. 13
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2009 OVERVIEW U.S. CARD SERVICES .. Securitization Income, Net: Decreased to ($2MM) from $227MM in 2Q '08, primarily due to lower excess spread, net, driven by increased write-offs, partially offset by the 2Q '08 charge to the fair value of the I/O Strip and lower interest expense due to lower rates paid on variable-rate investor certificates. .. Interest Income: Decreased 37%, due to a decline of 30% in the average owned lending balance and a lower portfolio yield, driven by reduced market interest rates and the impact of various customer assistance programs, and the movement of liquidity-related investment income to the Corporate & Other segment. These items were partially offset by the benefits of certain repricing initiatives. .. Interest Expense: Decreased 60%, due to a lower market interest rate-driven cost of funds and reduced average owned cardmember lending and receivable and liquidity investment balances. .. Provisions for Losses: Decreased 22%, principally due to a higher level of additions to lending reserves in 2Q '08 and lower loan and receivable balances which more than offset higher net write-off and past due loan levels. . Charge Card: * . The net write-off rate increased versus last year and last quarter. The past due rate decreased versus last year and last quarter. . Cardmember Lending: ** . The net write-off rate increased versus last year and last quarter. The past due rate increased versus last year, but decreased versus last quarter. The write-off and past due rates during 2009 both reflect the impact of various customer assistance programs. * There are no off-balance sheet Charge Card securitizations. Therefore, all credit quality statistics for the Charge Card portfolio are on an "Owned Basis." ** Owned basis. See pages 15-16 for "Managed Basis" Cardmember lending information. .. Marketing, Promotion, Rewards and Cardmember Services Expenses: Decreased 18%, primarily due to reduced marketing and promotion expenses and lower rewards costs. .. Salaries and Employee Benefits and Other Operating Expenses: Increased 3%, primarily due to a portion of the unfavorable impact related to fair value hedge ineffectiveness, higher deposit-related FDIC assessment costs and a portion of the Company's 2Q '09 net reengineering charge, partially offset by the benefits from ongoing reengineering activities. 14
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2009 OVERVIEW U.S. CARD SERVICES Managed Basis For USCS, the managed basis presentation assumes that there have been no off-balance sheet securitization transactions, i.e., all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the Company's balance sheets and income statements, respectively. For the managed basis presentation, revenue and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans are reflected in other commissions and fees (included in discount revenue, net card fees and other), interest income, interest expense and provisions for losses. On a managed basis, there is no securitization income, net, as the managed basis presentation assumes no securitization transactions have occurred. The Company presents USCS information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Management also believes that use of a managed basis presentation presents a more comprehensive portrayal of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business. Irrespective of the on- and off-balance sheet funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant in evaluating the Company's performance and can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The Company does not currently securitize international loans. On a GAAP basis, revenue and expenses from securitized cardmember loans are reflected in the Company's income statements in securitization income, net, fees and commissions, and provisions for losses for cardmember lending. At the time of a securitization transaction, the securitized cardmember loans are removed from the Company's balance sheet, and the resulting gain on sale is reflected in securitization income, net as well as an impact to provision for losses (credit reserves are no longer recorded for the cardmember loans once sold). Over the life of a securitization transaction, the Company recognizes servicing fees and other net revenues (referred to as "excess spread") related to the interests sold to investors (i.e. the investors' interests). These amounts, in addition to changes in the fair value of the interest-only strips, are reflected in securitization income, net, and fees and commissions. The Company also recognizes total interest income over the life of the securitization transaction related to the interest it retains (i.e. the seller's interest). At the maturity of a securitization transaction, cardmember loans on the balance sheet increase, and the impact of the incremental required loss reserves is recorded in provisions for losses. As presented, in aggregate over the life of a securitization transaction, the pretax income impact to the Company is the same whether or not the Company had securitized cardmember loans or funded these loans through other financing activities (assuming the same financing costs). The income statement classifications, however, of specific items will differ. The following information reconciles the GAAP basis presentation for certain USCS income statement line items to the managed basis presentation, where different: # Denotes a variance of more than 100%. 15
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECOND QUARTER 2009 OVERVIEW U.S. CARD SERVICES Managed P&L Discussion .. Discount Revenue, Net Card Fees and Other: Decreased 16%, largely due to lower billed business volumes, reduced other commissions and fees, decreased travel commissions and fees, lower other revenues and slightly lower net card fees. .. Interest Income: Decreased 25%, due to a decrease of 14% in the average managed lending balance and a lower portfolio yield, driven by reduced market interest rates and the impact of various customer assistance programs, and the movement of the liquidity-related investment income to the Corporate & Other segment. These items were partially offset by the benefits of certain repricing initiatives. .. Interest Expense: Decreased 64%, due to a lower market interest rate-driven cost of funds and lower average managed cardmember lending and receivable and liquidity investment balances. .. Provisions for Losses: Increased 5%, principally due to increased lending provisions from higher net write-off and past due loan levels, which more than offset the benefits of reduced loan and business volumes and a higher level of additions to lending reserves in 2Q '08. . Cardmember Lending: * . The write-off rate increased versus last year and last quarter. The past due rate increased versus last year, but decreased versus last quarter.

Billed Business: The 20% decrease in billed business reflects a 16% decrease in average spending per proprietary basic cards-in-force and a 6% decrease in basic cards-in-force. . Adjusting for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, billed business decreased 7% and average spending per proprietary basic card-in-force decreased 2%. Volume declines within the major geographic regions ranged from the low single digits in Latin America to the high single digits in Canada, Asia Pacific and Europe. . Total cards-in-force: Decreased by 800K, or 5%, versus last year, reflecting reduced card acquisition activities and the effects of certain credit-related actions, including the cancellation of inactive accounts over recent quarters. P&L Discussion .. Segment Income: Decreased 44% to $64MM, as total revenues net of interest expense declined 13%, provisions for losses increased 25% and expenses decreased by 21%. Both the revenue and expense declines were inflated by the translation impact of foreign currency. . 2Q '09 and 2Q '08 included $15MM ($10MM after-tax) and $1MM ($0MM after-tax) respectively, for costs related to the Company's ongoing reengineering initiatives. . Pre-tax Margin: Was 4.5% in 2Q '09 compared with 5.8% in 2Q '08. . Effective Tax Rate: Was (31%) in 2Q '09 compared with (58%) in 2Q '08. The rates in both periods reflect the impact of recurring tax benefits on varying pre-tax income. In addition, the 2Q '08 rate also reflects tax benefits related to the resolution of certain prior years' tax items. As indicated in previous quarters, this segment reflects an overall tax benefit which will likely continue going forward as the Company's internal tax allocation process provides ICS with the consolidated benefit related to its ongoing funding activities outside the U.S. .. Discount Revenue, Net Card Fees and Other: Decreased 17%, driven primarily by the lower level of card spending, decreased other commissions and fees, lower other revenues and reduced travel commissions and fees. Net card fees were effectively flat compared to last year. 17
