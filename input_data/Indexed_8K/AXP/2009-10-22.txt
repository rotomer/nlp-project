New York - October 22, 2009 - AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY (NYSE: AXP) today reported third-quarter income from continuing operations of $642 million, down 25 percent from $861 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.54, down 27 percent from $0.74 a year ago. The third quarter results included a $180 million ($113 million after-tax) non-recurring benefit associated with the company's accounting for a net investment in consolidated foreign subsidiaries (discussed in more detail later). Excluding that benefit, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.44.(2) Net income totaled $640 million for the quarter, down 21 percent from $815 million a year ago. Diluted per-share net income of $0.53 was down 24 percent from $0.70 a year ago. Excluding the non-recurring benefit mentioned above, adjusted diluted per-share net income was $0.43.(2) Consolidated revenues net of interest expense declined 16 percent to $6.0 billion, down from $7.2 billion a year ago. Consolidated provisions for losses totaled $1.2 billion, down 13 percent from $1.4 billion a year ago. Consolidated expenses totaled $3.9 billion, down 17 percent from $4.7 billion a year ago, reflecting in part the results of the company's reengineering initiatives. At the end of the quarter, the company's tier-one risk based capital ratio was 9.7 percent. Its tier-one common risk based ratio was 9.7 percent, which compared favorably to the regulatory benchmark(3) of 4 percent. The company's return on average equity (ROE) was 11.7 percent, down from 27.8 percent a year ago. Return on average common equity (ROCE), was 10.4 percent, down from 27.6 percent a year ago. "Our results showed further progress in navigating through the most difficult economic environment in decades," said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive officer. "We generated substantial earnings this quarter due, in part, to the reengineering efforts that have successfully lowered our expense base. Just as important, we stepped up investments in the business with a focus on: premium cobranded products, charge card offerings and brand building initiatives in the U.S. and select international markets. We funded these investments, as expected, from the benefits we realized from better credit metrics during the past several months. - ---------------------------- (2) Management believes the adjusted per share numbers provide useful metrics to evaluate the ongoing operating performance of the company. (3) The regulatory benchmark of 4 percent was used by the Federal Reserve within the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program earlier this year. -2-
"While third quarter revenues declined because cardmember spending and loan volumes were down from year-ago levels, overall billings have stabilized during the last few months and we saw indications that spending by corporate cardmembers is beginning to pick up. "During the quarter, we also expanded our deposit gathering activities, raising a net $4.1 billion as part of our funding strategy based on staying liquid at a time when the credit markets remain volatile. "At the start of the year the economy appeared to be in a freefall, the drop in cardmember spending was accelerating and loan loss rates were rising rapidly. Today, while there is still reason to be cautious about high unemployment levels, we are seeing broad-based improvements in credit quality, the trends in cardmember spending are encouraging and there are signs that the recession may be approaching an end. "Our three priorities remain: staying liquid, staying profitable and investing selectively for growth. However, in anticipation of sequential improvement in our loan loss provision during the fourth quarter, we are focused more and more on the third priority - investing in the business to make sure we capitalize on growth opportunities." During the third quarter, the translation effects of a comparatively stronger U.S. dollar contributed to lower non-U.S. revenues, provisions and expenses, compared to the year-ago quarter. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Discontinued operations for the third quarter generated a loss of $2 million compared with a loss of $46 million during the year-ago period. -3-
SEGMENT RESULTS U.S. CARD SERVICES reported third-quarter net income of $109 million, compared to net income of $244 million a year ago. Total revenues net of interest expense for the third quarter decreased 16 percent to $2.9 billion, driven by reduced cardmember spending, lower securitization income, net and lower loan balances. Provisions for losses totaled $850 million, a decrease of 10 percent from $941 million a year ago. The decrease reflected lower loans and receivables, as well as recent improvements in credit trends in both the charge and lending portfolios. On a managed basis(4), the net loan write-off rate was 8.9 percent, down from 10.0 percent in the second quarter and up from 5.9 percent a year ago. Owned net write-off rate was 9.8 percent in the quarter, down from 10.3 percent in the second quarter and up from 6.1 percent a year ago. Total expenses decreased 11 percent. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses decreased 16 percent from the year-ago period, reflecting lower rewards costs and reduced investments in marketing and promotion. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased 5 percent from year-ago levels, primarily due to the benefits of ongoing reengineering initiatives. INTERNATIONAL CARD SERVICES reported third-quarter net income of $127 million, compared to $67 million a year ago. Total revenues net of interest expense decreased 7 percent to $1.1 billion, primarily driven by reduced cardmember spending and lower loan balances. Provisions for losses totaled $250 million, a decrease of 21 percent from $316 million a year ago, primarily reflecting a lower level of loans and receivables. Total expenses decreased 16 percent. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses decreased 22 percent from year-ago levels, reflecting reduced marketing investments and lower rewards costs. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased 11 percent from year-ago levels, primarily due to the benefits of ongoing reengineering initiatives. GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES reported a third quarter net income of $116 million, compared to $134 million a year ago. Total revenues net of interest expense decreased 17 percent to $997 million, reflecting lower travel commissions and fees and reduced spending by corporate cardmembers compared to year ago levels. - ---------------------------- (4) Please refer to the information set forth on Exhibit I for further discussion of the owned and managed basis presentations. -4-
Total expenses decreased 17 percent. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses decreased 28 percent from the year-ago period, primarily reflecting lower rewards costs. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased 16 percent from the year-ago period, primarily due to the benefits of ongoing reengineering initiatives. GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES reported third-quarter net income of $240 million, compared to $258 million a year ago. Total revenues net of interest expense decreased 10 percent to $963 million, primarily reflecting lower merchant-related revenues driven by a decrease in global card billed business. Total expenses decreased 11 percent. Marketing and promotion expenses increased 5 percent from the year-ago period, primarily reflecting higher brand-related marketing investments. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased 15 percent, primarily due to the benefits of ongoing reengineering initiatives. CORPORATE AND OTHER reported a third-quarter net income of $50 million, compared with net income of $158 million a year ago. The results for both periods reflected the recognition of $220 million ($136 million after-tax) for the previously announced MasterCard and Visa settlements. This year's quarter included the previously mentioned non-recurring $180 million ($113 million after-tax) benefit associated with the company's accounting for a net investment in consolidated foreign subsidiaries. Of this benefit, $135 million ($85 million after-tax) represents a correction of an error related to the accounting for cumulative translation adjustments in prior periods. The impact of the incorrect accounting was not material to any of the quarterly or annual periods in which it occurred. The error resulted in a $60 million ($38 million after-tax) income overstatement in the second quarter 2009, a $135 million ($85 million after-tax) income understatement in the fourth quarter 2008 and minimal amounts for all other periods affected dating back to third quarter 2007, when the incorrect accounting originated. A non-recurring $45 million ($28 million after-tax) related benefit was also recorded in the current quarter as a result of changes in the fair value of certain foreign exchange forward contracts that are economic hedges to foreign currency exposures of net investments in consolidated foreign subsidiaries. These amounts were more than offset by items that included higher tax expense due primarily to a revision in the company's estimated annual effective tax rate and increased funding costs.

*** The 2009 third Quarter Earnings Supplement will be available today on the American Express web site at HTTP://IR.AMERICANEXPRESS.COM. An investor conference call will be held at 5:00 p.m. (ET) today to discuss third-quarter earnings results. Live audio and presentation slides for the investor conference call will be available to the general public at the same web site. A replay of the conference call will be available later today at the same web site address. EXHIBIT 1 (A) "Owned," a GAAP basis measurement, reflects only cardmember loans included in the company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. (B) The managed basis presentation assumes that there have been no off-balance sheet securitization transactions, i.e., all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the company's balance sheets and income statements, respectively. The difference between the "owned basis" (GAAP) information and "managed basis" information is attributable to the effects of securitization activities. The company presents U.S. Card Services information on a managed basis because that is the way the company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Management also believes that use of a managed basis presentation presents a more comprehensive portrayal of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business. Irrespective of the on and off-balance sheet funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant in evaluating the company's performance and can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The company does not currently securitize international loans. -6-

(Preliminary) AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION (Billions, except percentages and where indicated) (A) Card billed business includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements, and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards. Card billed business is reflected in the United States or outside the United States based on where the cardmember is domiciled. (B) Total cards-in-force represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding. Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner and does not include additional supplemental cards issued on that account. Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force include basic and supplemental cards issued to employee cardmembers. Non-proprietary basic cards-in-force includes all cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements. (C) This calculation is designed to approximate merchant pricing. It represents the percentage of billed business (both proprietary and Global Network Services) retained by the Company from merchants it acquires, prior to payments to third parties unrelated to merchant acceptance. (D) Average basic cardmember spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only. Average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs, plus card fees included in interest and fees on loans (including related amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs), divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force. The card fees related to cardmember loans included in interest and fees on loans were $47 million and $35 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The adjusted average fee per card is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs (a portion of which is charge card related and included in net card fees and a portion of which is lending related and included in interest and fees on loans). The amount of amortization excluded was $57 million and $84 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company presents adjusted average fee per card because management believes that this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products. -5-
(Preliminary) AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED) (Billions, except percentages and where indicated) # - Denotes a variance of more than 100%. (A) "Owned," a GAAP basis measurement, reflects only cardmember loans included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. (B) For the quarter ended September 30, 2009, this amount primarily includes $25 million of reserves that were removed in connection with securitizations during the period. The offset is in the allocated cost of the associated retained subordinated securities. This amount also includes foreign currency translation adjustments. The prior period primarily included foreign currency translation adjustments. (C) See Appendix III for discussion of net interest yield on cardmember loans. (D) Includes on-balance sheet cardmember loans and off-balance sheet securitized cardmember loans.

(Preliminary) AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION (Billions, except percentages and where indicated) (A) Card billed business includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements, and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards. Card billed business is reflected in the United States or outside the United States based on where the cardmember is domiciled. (B) Total cards-in-force represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding. Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner and does not include additional supplemental cards issued on that account. Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force include basic and supplemental cards issued to employee cardmembers. Non-proprietary basic cards-in-force includes all cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements. (C) This calculation is designed to approximate merchant pricing. It represents the percentage of billed business (both proprietary and Global Network Services) retained by the Company from merchants it acquires, prior to payments to third parties unrelated to merchant acceptance. (D) Average basic cardmember spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only. Average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs, plus card fees included in interest and fees on loans (including related amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs), divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force. The card fees related to cardmember loans included in interest and fees on loans were $47 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, $45 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, $40 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2009, $41 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2008, and $35 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2008, respectively. The adjusted average fee per card is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs (a portion of which is charge card related and included in net card fees and a portion of which is lending related and included in interest and fees on loans). The amount of amortization excluded for these periods was $57 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, $62 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, $70 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2009, $76 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2008, and $84 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2008, respectively. The Company presents adjusted average fee per card because management believes that this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products. -10-
(Preliminary) AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED) (Billions, except percentages and where indicated) (A) In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company revised the time period in which past due cardmember receivables in U.S. Card Services are written off to 180 days past due, consistent with applicable regulatory guidance. Previously, receivables were written off when 360 days past due. The net write-offs for the fourth quarter of 2008 include write-offs of $341 million resulting from this write-off methodology change, which is not reflected in the net write-off rate for U.S. Card Services. Including the $341 million in write-offs, the net write-off rate was 11.0 percent for the fourth quarter of 2008. (B) "Owned," a GAAP basis measurement, reflects only cardmember loans included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. (C) This amount primarily includes reserves of $25 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 and $144 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 that were removed in connection with securitizations during the period. The offset is in the allocated cost of the associated retained subordinated securities. This amount also includes foreign currency translation adjustments. Prior periods included foreign currency translation and other adjustments primarily related to the reclassification of waived fee reserves to a contra-cardmember receivable. (D) See Appendix III for discussion of net interest yield on cardmember loans. (E) Includes on-balance sheet cardmember loans and off-balance sheet securitized cardmember loans. The difference between the "owned basis" (GAAP) information and "managed basis" information is attributable to the effects of securitization activities. Refer to the information set forth under U.S. Card Services Selected Financial Information for further discussion of the managed basis presentation. -11-

(Preliminary) U.S. CARD SERVICES SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION MANAGED BASIS PRESENTATION (Millions) # - Denotes a variance of more than 100%. For U.S. Card Services, the managed basis presentation assumes that there have been no off-balance sheet securitization transactions, i.e., all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the Company's balance sheets and income statements, respectively. For the managed basis presentation, revenue and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans are reflected in other commissions and fees (included above in discount revenue, net card fees and other), interest income, interest expense, and provisions for losses. On a managed basis, there is no securitization income, net as the managed basis presentation assumes no securitization transactions have occurred. The Company presents U.S. Card Services information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Management also believes that use of a managed basis presentation presents a more comprehensive portrayal of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business. Irrespective of the on and off-balance sheet funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant in evaluating the Company's performance and can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The Company does not currently securitize international loans. -13-

EXHIBIT 99.3 [AMERICAN EXPRESS(R) LOGO] 2009 Third Quarter Earnings Supplement The enclosed summary should be read in conjunction with the text and statistical tables included in American Express Company's (the "Company" or "AXP") Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Release. This presentation contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of the date on which they are made. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, including the Company's financial and other goals, are set forth on page 23 of this Supplement, pages 59-61 in the Company's 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders and in its 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and other reports, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2009 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS - - Third quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders of $0.54 decreased 27% versus $0.74 last year. Total revenues net of interest expense decreased 16%. Return on average common equity ("ROCE") was 10.4% and return on average tangible common equity ("ROTCE"), which excludes goodwill and intangibles, was 13.5%.* - 3Q '09 Income from continuing operations included a $180MM ($113MM after-tax) benefit related to the accounting for a net investment in the Company's consolidated foreign subsidiaries, as discussed further on page 4. Excluding that benefit, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.44 and decreased 41%.** - 3Q '08 Income from continuing operations included a $100MM ($62MM after-tax) charge to the fair market value of the Company's interest-only strip ("I/O Strip"). - The discontinued operations line in the Consolidated Financial Statements contains the results of operations, assets and liabilities related to various business sales. During 3Q '09 and 3Q '08, this primarily includes the results from American Express International Deposit Company ("AEIDC"), which was sold to Standard Chartered PLC ("Standard Chartered") this quarter, as discussed further on page 6. -- 3Q '09 results included $2MM of losses from discontinued operations versus $46MM of losses last year. - Including discontinued operations, diluted EPS on a net income basis attributable to common shareholders of $0.53 decreased 24% versus $0.70 last year. Excluding the 3Q '09 benefit referenced above, adjusted net income per share was $0.43 and decreased 39%.** BUSINESS METRICS - - Compared with the third quarter of 2008: - Worldwide billed business of $156.6B decreased 11% as the negative impact of the global economic slowdown continued to be evident within a lower level of card spending. A comparatively stronger U.S. dollar resulted in a 2% greater decline versus last year within the reported worldwide growth rate. - Worldwide total cards-in-force of 88.4MM decreased 4%, or 3.7MM, from last year, and 0.1MM from last quarter. The decrease versus last year reflects the cancellation of a total of 3.3MM inactive cards during 2009, partially offset by the migration of cards from GE's commercial card and corporate purchasing unit, Corporate Payment Services ("CPS"), to the American Express network, primarily in 1Q '09. The comparison to both periods also reflects a relatively low level of card acquisition investments in recent quarters. - Worldwide average spending per proprietary basic cards-in-force decreased 5% reflecting the impact of the weak economic environment in both the U.S. and international markets, which was partially offset by the effect of the inactive card cancellations referenced above. A comparatively stronger U.S. dollar resulted in a 2% greater decline versus last year within the reported average spending growth rate. - Worldwide owned cardmember lending balances of $31.5B decreased 31%. On a managed basis, including securitized loans, cardmember lending balances of $60.7B declined 20%. These decreases reflected the lower cardmember spending levels and the Company's credit-related actions in the U.S. and certain international markets. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS - - SECURITIZATION INCOME, NET: Decreased 65% to $71MM, primarily due to lower excess spread, net, driven by increased write-offs and lower interest and fee income on cardmember loans, partially offset by the 3Q '08 charge to the fair value of the I/O Strip and lower interest expense due to lower rates paid on variable-rate investor certificates. Securitization income, net represents the non-credit provision components of the gains/(losses) from securitization activities within the U.S. Card Services ("USCS") segment, fair value changes of the related I/O Strip and excess spread related to securitized loans and servicing income, net of related discounts or fees. As of September 30, 2009, the fair market value of the I/O Strip remained at $0 versus $38MM as of September 30, 2008. - - TOTAL INTEREST INCOME: Decreased 29%, primarily due to lower interest and fees on loans and lower yields on investment securities and deposits. The decreased interest and fees on loans was primarily driven by a lower average owned loan balance, reduced market interest rates and the impact of various customer assistance programs, partially offset by the benefits of certain repricing initiatives. - - TOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE: Decreased 39%, primarily reflecting a lower cost of funds driven by the benefit of lower market interest rates on variable-rate long-term and short-term debt, as well as a lower average balance of short-term borrowings, partially offset by higher average customer deposits. - --------- * Please refer to Appendix I of the Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Release for the components of return on average equity ("ROE"), ROCE and ROTCE on a consolidated basis and Appendix II for return on average segment capital ("ROSC") and return on average tangible segment capital ("ROTSC") on a segment basis. ** Management believes the adjusted per share numbers provide useful metrics to evaluate the ongoing operating performance of the Company. - 1 -
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2009 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED - - TOTAL PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES: Decreased 13%, primarily due to lower owned loan and receivable balances and improved charge card-related credit indicators, partially offset by a higher cardmember lending reserve level. Cardmember lending loss reserves of $3.4B increased $140MM versus 2Q '09. - - MARKETING AND PROMOTION EXPENSES: Decreased 22% versus last year due to the relatively lower discretionary spending level resulting from the Company's ongoing reengineering activities. Expenses rose 43%, or $152MM, versus 2Q '09, reflecting the increased spending resulting from the provision benefits related to the better than initially forecasted 3Q '09 credit performance, as discussed further on page 5. - - CARDMEMBER REWARDS EXPENSE: Decreased 13%, primarily reflecting lower overall rewards-related spending volumes, and the benefit of a revised, more restrictive, redemption policy related to 30 day past due accounts, partially offset by higher redemption costs. - - SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSE: Decreased 14%, primarily reflecting lower employee levels and related costs due to the Company's ongoing reengineering initiatives, partially offset by costs related to employee compensation program-related changes. - Compared with last year, the total employee count from continuing operations of 59,200 decreased by 7,300 employees, or 11%. Compared with last quarter, the employee count declined by 1,500 employees, or 3%. - - SEGMENT INTEREST EXPENSE ALLOCATIONS: Beginning 1Q '09, the Company changed the manner in which it assesses the performance of its reportable operating segments to exclude the impact of its excess liquidity funding levels. Accordingly, the debt and related cash/investment balances associated with the Company's excess liquidity funding and the related net negative interest spread are no longer included within the reportable operating segment results (primarily within USCS and Global Commercial Services, or "GCS") and are now being reported in the Corporate & Other segment. The segment results for quarters prior to 1Q '09 have not been revised for this change. CAPITAL - - CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM: On January 9, 2009, as part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury's (the "Treasury") Capital Purchase Program ("CPP"), the Company issued to the Treasury $3.39B of preferred shares. Additionally, the Company issued warrants with a 10-year term to purchase common shares for up to 15% of that amount, or 24.3MM shares, at a per share exercise price of $20.95. In 1Q '09, both the preferred shares and warrants were recorded in the equity section in the Company's balance sheet at $3.16B and $232MM, respectively. The preferred shares were scheduled to accrete to their face value over a five year period. On June 9, 2009, the Company announced that it had received notification from the Treasury that it had met all of the requirements to repurchase the CPP preferred shares. This included the pre-condition that the Company raise capital in the public markets, which it successfully did with its issuance of $3.0B of non-guaranteed senior debt on May 18, 2009 and the completion of a $500MM common equity offering on June 5, 2009. As such, the Company completed the repurchase of the CPP shares on June 17, 2009. Upon repurchase, the accretion of the preferred shares to face value was accelerated, amounting to a one-time negative EPS impact during 2Q '09 of $212MM, or $0.18 per basic and diluted common share. Additionally, the Company recorded $13MM in preferred shares dividends, as well as $9MM of related accretion of the preferred shares, for the period ended June 17, 2009 when the shares were repurchased, which further reduced 2Q '09 diluted EPS by approximately $0.02 per share. On July 1, 2009, the Company submitted notice to the Treasury of its intent to repurchase the warrants issued under the CPP program. On July 29, 2009, the Company repurchased the warrants for $340MM, which provided the Treasury with an annualized return on the Company's CPP participation of 26%. The warrant repurchase resulted in a reduction of cash and corresponding adjustment to Retained Earnings and Additional Paid-In Capital on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. There was no impact to the Company's Consolidated Net Income or EPS. - - CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION TO SHAREHOLDERS: During 3Q '09, approximately 77% of capital generated was distributed to shareholders through our quarterly common share dividend and the repurchase of the warrants issued under the CPP, as earnings were suppressed by the challenging economic environment. No shares have been repurchased over the last six quarters, as share repurchases were suspended during 1Q '08 in light of the challenging global economic environment and limitations while under the CPP. Since the inception of repurchase programs in December 1994, 670MM shares have been acquired under cumulative Board authorizations to repurchase up to 770MM shares. On a cumulative basis, since 1994 the Company has distributed 68% of capital generated through share repurchases and dividends.* - --------- * Without considering the 2Q '09 common stock issuance, the distribution to shareholders of capital generated through share repurchases and dividends on a cumulative basis since 1994 through 3Q '09 would have been approximately 69%. - 2 -
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2009 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED - SHARES OUTSTANDING AND REPURCHASE ACTIVITY: Total shares outstanding were flat during 3Q '09. - - CAPITAL RATIOS: As of September 30, 2009, the Company's key consolidated capital ratios* were as follows: FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY - - FUNDING SOURCES: The Company's primary funding activities focus on a mixture of retail deposits, unsecured debt and asset-backed securities. The Company currently has an objective to hold excess cash and readily marketable securities to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund normal business operations for in excess of a 12-month period, in addition to having access to significant additional contingent liquidity sources, in the event that access to its primary funding sources should become unavailable. As of September 30, 2009, the Company held $25B of excess cash and readily marketable securities on its balance sheet. The Company offers brokered deposits within its American Express Centurion Bank and American Express Bank, FSB subsidiaries (together, the "Banks"). These funds are insured up to $250,000 through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). In addition, during 2Q '09, the Company launched a direct deposit-taking program, Personal Savings from American Express. This program makes FDIC-insured certificates of deposit ("CDs") and high-yield savings account products available directly from American Express Bank, FSB to consumers. On March 3, 2009, the Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board announced the launch of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility ("TALF"), which is currently set to expire on March 31, 2010. Securitized credit and charge card receivables are eligible collateral under the TALF, provided the securities qualify for AAA ratings from two or more major nationally recognized statistical rating organizations ("NRSROs"). The Company believes that an additional $12.1B of securities backed by its cardmember loans or receivables would be eligible under this program. In addition to deposit, unsecured and asset-backed funding, the Company can draw upon various other funding sources: - COMMERCIAL PAPER: The Company had continuous access to the commercial paper market throughout the quarter. In addition, the Commercial Paper Financial Facility ("CPFF") became operational on October 27, 2008, and is currently set to expire on February 1, 2010.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2009 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED to qualify for participation in the CPFF. At September 30, 2009, the Company had $1.1B of commercial paper outstanding, none of which was placed with the CPFF. - DISCOUNT WINDOW: The Banks are insured depository institutions that have the capability of borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (i.e., access to the Federal Reserve Bank discount window), subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that they pledge. The Federal Reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window or its Term Auction Facility (TAF) program. - BANK LINES: At September 30, 2009, the Company maintained committed bank lines of credit totaling $12.0B, of which $3.1B was drawn as part of the Company's normal non-U.S. funding activities. The committed facilities have $2.0B of expirations in 2010 and $3.3B in 2011, with the remainder expiring in 2012. - - FUNDING ACTIVITIES: During 3Q '09, the Company funded its business through payments received from customers on loan and receivable balances, its deposit-taking activities within the Banks, asset-backed securitization activity and unsecured non-guaranteed debt issuance. - DEPOSITS: The Company held the following deposits as of 3Q '09. The average duration and rate on outstanding U.S. retail CDs was 26 months and 2.5%, respectively. - TALF-ELIGIBLE ABS: On September 11, 2009, the Company closed on a $1.25B 5-year, TALF-eligible, Class A security offering, priced at one-month LIBOR plus 125bps. The Company issued and retained $265MM of subordinated securities related to this transaction. - UNSECURED NON-GUARANTEED DEBT: During the quarter, the Company completed a 5-year unsecured, non-guaranteed debt transaction through its Credco subsidiary, with the issuance of $1.5B of notes on August 25, 2009, with a coupon of 5.125%. In addition, on October 1, 2009, Credco issued GBP 750MM of 5-year notes with a coupon of 5.375%. On October 5, 2009, the Company issued through its American Express Canada Credit Corporation subsidiary CAD $800MM of 5-year notes with a coupon of 4.853% and CAD $150MM of 2-year notes priced at 3-month CDOR (Canadian Deposit Offered Rate) plus 170bps. - - FUNDING REQUIREMENTS: The maturities of the Company's long-term debt, debt issued in connection with off-balance sheet securitizations and long-term CDs for the following four quarters are as follows: OTHER ITEMS OF NOTE - - BENEFIT RECORDED RELATED TO A NET INVESTMENT IN CONSOLIDATED FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES: In 3Q '09, the Company recorded a $180MM ($113MM after-tax) benefit, reflected in the "other, net" expense line in the Corporate & Other segment, associated with the Company's accounting for a net investment in consolidated foreign subsidiaries. $135MM ($85MM after-tax) of this benefit represents a correction of an error related to the accounting for cumulative translation adjustments in prior periods. The impact of the incorrect accounting was not material to any of the quarterly or annual periods in which it occurred. The error resulted in: a $60MM ($38MM after-tax) income overstatement in 2Q '09, a $135MM ($85MM after-tax) income understatement in 4Q '08 and minimal amounts for all other periods affected dating back to 3Q '07, when the incorrect accounting originated. A non-recurring $45MM ($28MM after-tax) related benefit was also recorded in 3Q '09 as a result of changes in the fair value of certain foreign exchange forward contracts that are economic hedges to foreign currency exposures of net investments in consolidated foreign subsidiaries. - - REENGINEERING INITIATIVES: On October 30, 2008, the Company announced various reengineering initiatives which were expected to produce cost benefits of approximately $1.8B in 2009 versus the previously anticipated spending levels. These initiatives include: reducing staffing levels - --------- * Includes all deposits outstanding through the Company's brokered retail CD and sweep programs, in addition to its Personal Savings direct deposit program. - 4 -
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2009 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED and compensation expenses (expected benefit of $700MM in 2009), reducing certain operating costs (expected benefit of $125MM in 2009) and scaling back investment spending (expected benefit of $1B in 2009). The Company began the execution and implementation of these initiatives in 4Q '08, and as such, recorded a 4Q '08 restructuring charge of $404MM ($262MM after-tax) in continuing operations, primarily associated with severance and other costs related to the elimination of approximately 7,000 positions. On May 18, 2009, the Company announced another phase of reengineering initiatives which were expected to produce incremental cost benefits of approximately $0.8B in 2009. These initiatives include: reducing staffing levels and compensation expenses, (expected benefit of $175MM in 2009), scaling back investment spending on marketing and business development (expected benefit of $500MM in 2009) and cutting certain professional services, travel and general overhead expenses (expected benefit of $125MM in 2009). The Company began to implement these initiatives in 2Q '09, and as such, recorded a 2Q '09 net reengineering charge of $182MM ($118MM after-tax) in continuing operations, primarily associated with severance and other costs related to the elimination of approximately 4,000 positions. Cumulatively through these reengineering initiatives, the Company expects to eliminate approximately 11,000 positions, which accounted for approximately 17% of its global workforce as of September 30, 2008. As the Company has previously indicated, provision benefits related to better than initially forecasted credit trends during 2009 are being utilized to selectively increase spending on marketing and other business initiatives during the second half of the year, and, therefore, will partially reduce the initial expected total 2009 reengineering benefit of $1.5B related to reduced investment spending. Separately, 3Q '09 and 3Q '08 income from continuing operations included $12MM ($9MM after-tax) and $11MM ($7MM after-tax) of net reengineering costs, respectively, across the Company's reportable operating segments. - - INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA ("ICBC") SALE: On April 28, 2009, the Company announced that it divested 50% of its investment in ICBC, or 638MM of ICBC's Class H shares, through a private sale and realized a $211MM ($135MM after-tax) gain from the sale, which was reported in the "other revenues" line within the Corporate & Other segment in 2Q '09. The Company had previously acquired its interest in 2006 and, per its agreement with ICBC, was not permitted to sell any portion of this investment prior to the date of the actual sale. The agreement allows for the Company to divest its stake in two 50% increments, with the remaining shares eligible for sale after October 20, 2009. However, on October 19, 2009, the Company announced that while it will reevaluate its shareholding from time to time depending on market conditions, it has no current plans to sell its shares. - - MASTER TRUST: On May 22, 2009, the Company announced its plans to take certain actions which would benefit the outstanding investor certificates of the American Express Credit Account Master Trust ("Master Trust") and the related American Express Credit Account Secured Note Trusts (the "Note Trusts"). These actions consisted of the issuance of two new series of asset-backed securities totaling $1.5B, which provide additional credit enhancement to all existing outstanding series, and the exercise of a discount option with respect to new principal receivables arising in the Master Trust. In addition to improving the levels of credit enhancement for existing series of securities issued by the Master Trust and the Note Trusts, these actions increased the yield (or trust excess spread rate) on assets in the Master Trust by 400-600 basis points beginning with the July monthly reporting period. The Master Trust modifications had no impact on the Company's Consolidated Income Statement. Within the 2Q '09 Consolidated Balance Sheet, $1.5B of owned cardmember loans less associated reserves have been transferred to retained subordinated securities within investment securities. As a result of the modifications, the Master Trust's assets are now included within risk-weighted assets for regulatory capital purposes. Separately, on August 20, 2009, approximately $3B of loans generated from cardmember accounts were newly designated for addition to the Master Trust from the owned portfolio. - - VISA AND MASTERCARD LITIGATION SETTLEMENTS: In November of 2004, the Company filed suit against Visa Inc., Visa USA and Visa International (collectively "Visa"), MasterCard Inc. ("MasterCard") and certain of their member banks to seek monetary damages for the lost business opportunity that resulted from the illegal conspiracy to boycott American Express from partnering with U.S. credit card issuing banks. The Company reached agreements with Visa on November 7, 2007 and with MasterCard on June 25, 2008. All defendants were removed and the case was dismissed. Under the terms of the settlement agreements, the Company will receive aggregate maximum payments of up to $2.25B from Visa and $1.8B from MasterCard. The settlement with Visa is comprised of an initial payment of $1.13B ($700MM after-tax) that was recorded in 4Q '07 and received in March 2008, and quarterly payments of up to $70MM ($43MM after-tax) for four years from 1Q '08 through 4Q '11. The settlement with MasterCard is comprised of quarterly payments of up to $150MM ($93MM after-tax) for three years from 3Q '08 through 2Q '11. The Company recognized $70MM from Visa for each of the past seven quarters and $150MM from MasterCard for each of the past five quarters pursuant to these agreements. The installment payments from both parties are subject to the Company achieving certain quarterly performance criteria in the Global Network Services ("GNS") business within the U.S., which the Company believes it is positioned to meet. Payments earned through September 2009 have been recorded as a reduction to the "other, net" expense line within the Corporate & Other segment. - 5 -
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2009 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED - - ACQUISITION OF CPS: On March 28, 2008, the Company completed its purchase of CPS for $1.1B in cash and the repayment of $1.2B in CPS debt. The purchase included card relationships with GE, as well as more than 300 large corporate clients, which cumulatively generated over $14B in global purchase volume in 2007. As of March 31, 2009, the GE commercial card relationships that have agreed to become GCS clients have migrated to the AXP network as the Company issues commercial cards to their employees. Therefore, the cards issued and spending related to these relationships are now recorded as "cards-in-force" and "billed business", and the associated receivables are reflected in the "cardmember receivables" line. In addition, where applicable, CPS revenues and expenses that were previously reported in "other revenues" and "other, net expense" are now reported in the relevant revenue and expense line items. - - AEB AND AEIDC: On September 18, 2007, the Company announced that it entered into an agreement to sell AEB, its international banking subsidiary, and AEIDC, a subsidiary that issues investment certificates to AEB's customers, to Standard Chartered. On February 29, 2008, Standard Chartered completed its purchase of the AEB portion of this transaction. In 2Q '08, the Company and Standard Chartered agreed on the final purchase price of $796MM, equaling the final net asset value of the businesses that were sold plus $300MM. In 3Q '09, the AEIDC portion of the transaction was completed for total consideration of $1MM. Therefore, for all periods presented, the AEB and AEIDC results, assets and liabilities are reported within Discontinued Operations on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2009 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED - - CONSOLIDATED TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE: Consolidated total revenues net of interest expense decreased 16%, reflecting decreases versus last year of 16% in USCS, 7% in International Card Services ("ICS"), 17% in GCS and 10% in Global Network & Merchant Services ("GNMS"). Total revenues net of interest expense decreased due to lower discount revenues, lower total interest income, reduced securitization income, net, lower other commissions and fees, reduced travel commissions and fees, decreased other revenues and slightly lower net card fees, partially offset by lower total interest expense. Translation of foreign currency resulted in an approximately 2% greater decline in the reported revenues net of interest expense growth rate. - - CONSOLIDATED PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES: Consolidated provisions for losses decreased 13% versus last year, reflecting decreases of 10% in USCS, 21% in ICS, 33% in GCS and 3% in GNMS. The provision decreased primarily due to the impact of lower owned loan and receivable balances and improved charge card credit indicators, partially offset by a higher cardmember lending reserve level. Translation of foreign currency reduced the reported consolidated provisions for losses growth rate by approximately 2%. - - CONSOLIDATED EXPENSES: Consolidated expenses decreased 17%, reflecting decreases of 11% in USCS, 16% in ICS, 17% in GCS and 11% in GNMS. The total expense decline reflected decreased other, net expenses, reduced salaries and employee benefits expenses, lower cardmember rewards expenses, decreased marketing and promotion expenses, lower professional services expenses, reduced occupancy and equipment expenses, lower cardmember services expenses and decreased communications expenses. Translation of foreign currency resulted in an approximately 2% greater decline in the reported consolidated expenses growth rate. - - PRETAX MARGIN: Was 15.3% of total revenues net of interest expense in 3Q '09 compared with 15.0% in 3Q '08. - - EFFECTIVE TAX RATE: Was 30% in 3Q '09 versus 20% in 3Q '08. The 3Q '09 tax rate reflects higher tax expense during the quarter primarily due to an increase in the Company's estimated annual effective tax rate. The 3Q '08 rate reflects the impact of a benefit related to a reduction during the quarter of the estimated annual effective tax rate. - - DISCOUNT REVENUE: Decreased 12% on an 11% decrease in billed business. The greater revenue versus billed business decline primarily reflects the relatively faster growth in billed business related to GNS, where we share discount revenue with our card issuing partners. - The average discount rate* was 2.54% in 3Q '09 versus 2.55% in 2Q '09 and 2.56% in 3Q '08. As indicated in prior quarters, selective repricing initiatives, changes in the mix of business and volume-related pricing discounts will likely result in some erosion of the average discount rate over time. * For additional information about billed business and discount rate calculations, please refer to the Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Release, American Express Company Selected Statistical Information pages. ** Proprietary card activity only. - 9 -
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2009 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED - - WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS: The 11% decrease in worldwide billed business reflected decreases of 13% in USCS, 12% in ICS and 14% in GCS, respectively, partially offset by a 2% increase in GNS. The table below summarizes selected billed business related statistics for 3Q '09: *Captions not designated as "proprietary" include both proprietary and GNS data. **Included in USCS. +Included in GCS. ++Included in ICS. -- U.S. non-T&E-related volume categories (which represented approximately 71% of total U.S. billed business) declined 10%, while T&E volumes declined 14%. -- U.S. airline-related volume, which represented approximately 9% of total U.S. volumes during the quarter, decreased 18% due to a 22% decrease in the average airline charge partially offset by a 6% increase in airline transactions. -- Worldwide airline volumes, which represented approximately 10% of total volumes during the quarter, decreased 21% due to a 22% decrease in the average airline charge partially offset by a 2% increase in airline transactions. -- Assuming no changes in foreign exchange rates: Total billed business outside the U.S. reflected mid-single-digit volume increases in Latin America, a slight increase in Asia Pacific and high-single-digit declines in Canada and Europe. - TOTAL CARDS-IN-FORCE: Declined 4% worldwide due to decreases of 11% in USCS and 7% in ICS, partially offset by increases of 1% in GCS and 10% in GNS. The declines in USCS and ICS reflect the cancellation of approximately 3.3MM inactive cards during 2009 within these segments. The increase in GCS was driven by the migration of CPS cards to the American Express network in 1Q '09. -- During the quarter, total cards-in-force decreased by 400K in the U.S., but increased by 300K outside the U.S. despite the cancellation of approximately 150K inactive cards within ICS. - - NET CARD FEES: Decreased 1% as the decline in total proprietary cards-in-force more than offset a 9% increase in the average fee per card. - - TRAVEL COMMISSIONS AND FEES: Decreased 23%, primarily reflecting a 29% decrease in worldwide travel sales, partly offset by a higher sales commission rate. - - OTHER COMMISSIONS AND FEES: Decreased 22%, driven primarily by lower delinquency fees reflecting decreased owned loan balances and the impacts of various customer assistance programs, in addition to reduced spending-related foreign currency conversion revenues. - - SECURITIZATION INCOME, NET: Decreased 65% to $71MM, primarily due to lower excess spread, net, driven by increased write-offs and lower interest and fee income on cardmember loans, partially offset by the 3Q '08 charge to the fair value of the I/O Strip and lower interest expense due to lower rates paid on variable-rate investor certificates. Securitization income, net represents the non-credit provision components of the gains/(losses) from securitization activities within the USCS segment, fair value changes of the related I/O Strip and excess spread related to securitized loans and servicing income, net of related discounts or fees. - 10 -
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2009 OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATED - Components of Securitization Income, Net: # Denotes a variance of more than 100%. * Excess spread, net is the net cash flow from interest and fee collections allocated to the investors' interests after deducting the interest paid on investor certificates, credit losses, contractual servicing fees, other expenses and changes in the fair value of the I/O Strip. **Excludes $119MM and ($252MM) of impact from cardmember loan sales and maturities in 3Q '09 and $189MM and ($38MM) of impact from cardmember loan sales and maturities in 3Q '08, which are reflected in provisions for losses for each respective period. - The average balance of cardmember lending securitizations was $28.4B in 3Q '09 compared with $28.1B in 3Q '08. - - OTHER REVENUES: Decreased 19%, primarily reflecting decreased revenues from the CPS acquisition versus 3Q '08 due to the migration of clients to the AXP network as well as lower publishing revenues. - - TOTAL INTEREST INCOME: Decreased 29%. - INTEREST AND FEES ON LOANS: Decreased 32%, due to a 32% decline in the average owned loan balance, reduced market interest rates and the impact of various customer assistance programs, partially offset by the benefits of certain repricing initiatives. - INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES: Increased 15%, primarily reflecting increased investment levels partially offset by reduced investment yields. - DEPOSITS WITH BANKS AND OTHER: Was $9MM versus $74MM in 3Q '08, primarily due to a reduced yield and a lower balance of deposits in other banks. - - TOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE: Decreased 39%. - DEPOSITS: Was unchanged versus last year, as the significant increase in balances was offset by a lower cost of funds. - SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS: Decreased 98%, due to significantly lower short-term debt levels and a lower cost of funds. - LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER: Decreased 35%, primarily reflecting a lower cost of funds driven by reduced market rates on variably-priced debt, as well as a lower average balance of long-term debt outstanding. - - CHARGE CARD PROVISION FOR LOSSES: Decreased 59%, driven by improved credit indicators and lower receivable levels. - WORLDWIDE CHARGE CARD:* -- The write-off rates were mixed versus last year and last quarter. Past due rates were lower versus last year and last quarter. *There are no off-balance sheet Charge Card securitizations. Therefore, all credit quality statistics for the Charge Card portfolio are on an "Owned Basis." +In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company revised the time period in which past due cardmember receivables in USCS are written off to 180 days past due, consistent with applicable regulatory guidance. Previously, receivables were written off when 360 days past due. - - CARDMEMBER LENDING PROVISION FOR LOSSES: Increased 3%, primarily reflecting a higher cardmember reserve level, partially offset by a lower owned loan balance. - 11 -

Expenses rose 43%, or $152MM, versus 2Q '09, reflecting the increased spending resulting from the provision benefits related to better than initially forecasted 3Q '09 credit performance. - - CARDMEMBER REWARDS EXPENSE: Decreased 13%, primarily reflecting lower overall rewards-related spending volumes, and the benefit of a revised, more restrictive redemption policy related to 30 day past due accounts, partially offset by higher redemption costs. - - CARDMEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES: Decreased 11%. - - SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSE: Decreased 14%, primarily reflecting lower employee levels and related costs due to the Company's ongoing reengineering initiatives, partially offset by costs related to employee compensation program-related changes. - - PROFESSIONAL SERVICES EXPENSE: Decreased 5%, reflecting lower technology-related and legal costs, partially offset by higher credit and collection expenses. - - OCCUPANCY AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSE: Decreased 6%, on lower technology-related expenses. - - COMMUNICATIONS EXPENSE: Decreased 11%, driven by lower volume-related costs. - - OTHER, NET EXPENSE: Was a $14MM credit versus $209MM expense last year, reflecting the $180MM benefit in 3Q '09 related to the accounting for a net investment in the Company's consolidated foreign subsidiaries as further discussed on page 4, as well as lower travel and entertainment and other expenses due to the Company's ongoing reengineering activities. - 12 -

Please refer to Appendix II of the Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Release for the components of ROSC and ROTSC. - BILLED BUSINESS: The 13% decrease in billed business reflects the lower average spending per proprietary basic cards-in-force and the reduced basic cards-in-force level. -- Within the U.S. consumer business, billed business decreased 12%; small business volumes declined by 15%. - TOTAL CARDS-IN-FORCE: Decreased by 4.9MM, or 11%, versus last year, reflecting the effects of certain credit-related actions, including the cancellation of a total of approximately 2.7MM inactive cards during 2009, as well as reduced card acquisition activities in recent quarters. P&L DISCUSSION: - - SEGMENT INCOME: Decreased 55% to $109MM, as total revenues net of interest expense declined 16%, provisions for losses decreased 10% and expenses declined by 11%. - 3Q '09 included $2MM ($1MM after-tax) of adjustments related to the Company's ongoing reengineering initiatives. - 3Q '08 included the $100MM ($62MM after-tax) charge to the fair market value of the I/O Strip. - PRETAX MARGIN: Was 4.8% in 3Q '09 compared with 10.5% in 3Q '08. - EFFECTIVE TAX RATE: Was 22% in 3Q '09 compared with 33% in 3Q '08.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2009 OVERVIEW U.S. CARD SERVICES - - SECURITIZATION INCOME, NET: Decreased 65% to $71MM, primarily due to lower excess spread, net, driven by increased write-offs and lower interest and fee income on cardmember loans, partially offset by the 3Q '08 charge to the fair value of the I/O Strip and lower interest expense due to lower rates paid on variable-rate investor certificates. - - INTEREST INCOME: Decreased 35%, due to a decline of 36% in the average owned lending balance and a lower portfolio yield, driven by reduced market interest rates and the impact of various customer assistance programs, and the movement of liquidity-related investment income to the Corporate & Other segment. These items were partially offset by the benefits of certain repricing initiatives. - - INTEREST EXPENSE: Decreased 61%, due to a lower market interest rate-driven cost of funds and reduced average owned cardmember lending and receivable and liquidity investment balances. - - PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES: Decreased 10%, principally due to lower loan and receivable balances and decreased write-offs in the charge portfolio, partially offset by a higher cardmember lending reserve level. - CHARGE CARD: * -- The net write-off and past due rates decreased versus last year and last quarter. - CARDMEMBER LENDING: ** -- The net write-off and past due rates increased versus last year but decreased versus last quarter. The write-off and past due rates during 2009 reflect the impact of various customer assistance programs. * There are no off-balance sheet Charge Card securitizations.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2009 OVERVIEW U.S. CARD SERVICES MANAGED BASIS For USCS, the managed basis presentation assumes that there have been no off-balance sheet securitization transactions, i.e., all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the Company's balance sheets and income statements, respectively. For the managed basis presentation, revenue and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans are reflected in other commissions and fees (included in discount revenue, net card fees and other), interest income, interest expense and provisions for losses. On a managed basis, there is no securitization income, net, as the managed basis presentation assumes no securitization transactions have occurred. The Company presents USCS information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company's management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Management also believes that use of a managed basis presentation presents a more comprehensive portrayal of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business. Irrespective of the on- and off-balance sheet funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant in evaluating the Company's performance and can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The Company does not currently securitize international loans. On a GAAP basis, revenue and expenses from securitized cardmember loans are reflected in the Company's income statements in securitization income, net, fees and commissions, and provisions for losses for cardmember lending. At the time of a securitization transaction, the securitized cardmember loans are removed from the Company's balance sheet, and the resulting gain on sale is reflected in securitization income, net as well as an impact to provision for losses (credit reserves are no longer recorded for the cardmember loans once sold). Over the life of a securitization transaction, the Company recognizes servicing fees and other net revenues (referred to as "excess spread") related to the interests sold to investors (i.e. the investors' interests). These amounts, in addition to changes in the fair value of the interest-only strips, are reflected in securitization income, net, and fees and commissions. The Company also recognizes total interest income over the life of the securitization transaction related to the interest it retains (i.e. the seller's interest). At the maturity of a securitization transaction, cardmember loans on the balance sheet increase, and the impact of the incremental required loss reserves is recorded in provisions for losses. As presented, in aggregate over the life of a securitization transaction, the pretax income impact to the Company is the same whether or not the Company had securitized cardmember loans or funded these loans through other financing activities (assuming the same financing costs). The income statement classifications, however, of specific items will differ. The following information reconciles the GAAP basis presentation for certain USCS income statement line items to the managed basis presentation, where different: 16
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY THIRD QUARTER 2009 OVERVIEW U.S. CARD SERVICES MANAGED P&L DISCUSSION - - DISCOUNT REVENUE, NET CARD FEES AND OTHER: Decreased 14%, due to lower billed business volumes, reduced other commissions and fees, decreased net card fees, lower travel commissions and fees and slightly lower other revenues. - - INTEREST INCOME: Decreased 28%, due to a decline of 18% in the average managed lending balance and a lower portfolio yield, driven by reduced market interest rates and the impact of various customer assistance programs, and the movement of the liquidity-related investment income to the Corporate & Other segment. These items were partially offset by the benefits of certain repricing initiatives. - - INTEREST EXPENSE: Decreased 63%, due to a lower market interest rate-driven cost of funds and lower average managed cardmember lending and receivable and liquidity investment balances. - - PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES: Decreased 12%, principally due to lower loan and receivable balances and lower write-offs in the charge portfolio, partially offset by higher net write-offs versus last year in the lending portfolio. - CARDMEMBER LENDING: * -- Net write-off and past due rates increased versus last year but decreased versus last quarter. The write-off and past due rates during 2009 both reflect the impact of various customer assistance programs. *Managed basis. There are no off-balance sheet Charge Card securitizations.

Please refer to Appendix II of the Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Release for the components of ROSC and ROTSC. - BILLED BUSINESS: The 12% decrease in billed business reflects a 5% decrease in average spending per proprietary basic cards-in-force and a 8% decrease in basic cards-in-force. -- Adjusting for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, billed business decreased 6% and average spending per proprietary basic cards-in-force increased 1%. Volume comparisons within the major geographic regions ranged from a low-single-digit increase in Latin America to high-single-digit decreases in Canada, Asia Pacific and Europe. - TOTAL CARDS-IN-FORCE: Decreased by 1.2MM, or 7%, versus last year, reflecting reduced card acquisition activities and the effects of certain credit-related actions, including the cancellation of a total of approximately 550K inactive accounts during 2009.

Both the revenue and expense declines were inflated by the translation impact of foreign currency. - 3Q '09 and 3Q '08 included $1MM ($1MM after-tax) and $1MM ($0MM after-tax) of adjustments, respectively, related to the Company's ongoing reengineering initiatives. - PRETAX MARGIN: Was 11.1% in 3Q '09 compared with 0.1% in 3Q '08. - EFFECTIVE TAX RATE: The tax rate was not meaningful in 3Q '09 and 3Q '08.

As indicated in previous quarters, this segment reflects the favorable impact of the consolidated tax benefit related to its ongoing funding activities outside the U.S., which is allocated to ICS under the Company's internal tax allocation process and is likely to continue going forward. 18
