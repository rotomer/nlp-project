American Express Company (the Company) is hereby furnishing below owned and managed basis delinquency and write-off statistics for the lending portfolio of its U.S. Card Services (USCS) operating segment for the months ended September 30, October 31 and November 30, 2009.  As previously stated in its reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission), the Company believes that its managed basis presentation provides the Companys investors with a more comprehensive portrayal of the key dynamics of the Companys U.S. cardmember lending business over time.
As of and for the months ended September 30, October 31 and November 30, 2009
(Billions, except percentages)
 
 
The statistics presented above provide information that is additional to the data reported by the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust) in its monthly Form 10-D report filed with the Commission.  The loans that have been securitized through the off-balance sheet Lending Trust do not possess identical characteristics with those of the total (i.e., managed) portfolio of USCS loans, which reflects the aggregate of securitized and owned loans.  Thus, the reported credit performance of the Lending Trust may, on a month-to-month basis, be better or worse than the credit performance of the managed portfolio.  Reported differences may arise as a result of, among other things, differences in the mix and vintage of loans between the Lending Trust and the managed portfolio (including, among other things, the larger proportion of small business loans in the owned portfolio), the number of days in the reporting period covered by the Form 10-D being filed by the Lending Trust, the use of end-of-period principal loan balances to calculate write-off statistics in the Lending Trust compared to the use of average loan balances over the reporting period used in the managed statistics, as well as other mechanics of the calculation for the owned net write-off rate, which is impacted by the additions, issuances and maturities relating to the securitization trust within a particular period.  In addition, the reporting period for the managed portfolio is based on a calendar month, as compared to the reporting period covered by the Form 10-D reports for the Lending Trust, which is generally based on a monthly period beginning on or around the 25th day of each calendar month.
Set forth below is certain information regarding the credit performance of the Lending Trust for its three most recent monthly reporting periods, as reported in its Form 10-D report filed with respect to each such period.

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made.  The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following:  the Company's ability to manage credit risk related to consumer and small business loans and other credit trends, which will depend in part on the economic environment, including, among other things, the housing market, the rates of bankruptcies and unemployment, which can affect spending on card products and debt payments by individuals and small business customers, and on the effectiveness of the Company's credit models; the impact of the Company's efforts to deal with delinquent cardmembers in the current challenging economic environment, which may affect payment patterns of cardmembers, the actual level of cardmember delinquencies in the future and the perception of the Company's services, products and brands; the Company's near-term write-off rates, including those for the fourth quarter of 2009, which will depend in part on changes in the level of the Company's loan balances, delinquency rates of cardmembers and bankruptcy filings and unemployment rates; and the actual amount to be spent by the Company on marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services based on management's assessment of competitive opportunities and other factors affecting its judgment, and during the remainder of 2009, the extent of provision benefit, if any, from lower than expected write offs.  A further description of these and other risks and uncertainties can be found in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2009, and its other reports filed with the SEC.
