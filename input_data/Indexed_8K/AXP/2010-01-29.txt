(e)  On January 25, 2010, the Compensation and Benefits Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors of American Express Company (the Company) approved increases to the annual base salaries (effective February 1, 2010) of the following named executive officers (as determined by reference to the Companys proxy statement in respect of its 2009 annual meeting of shareholders):
The increases in base salary reflect the Committees review of the Companys executive compensation program.  The Committee approved a shift in compensation mix by increasing base salary, while reducing the aggregate compensation that generally could be earned through annual incentive awards and the Companys cash-based portfolio grant program.  The Companys overall executive compensation program for named executive officers continues to be weighted toward longer-term incentives, particularly stock-based awards.
