New York  July 22, 2010 -today reported second-quarter net income of $1 billion, up from $337 million a year ago. Diluted per share net income was $0.84, up from $0.09 a year ago. The year-ago results include a per share reduction of $0.18 from a repurchase of preferred shares from the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
American Express Company (NYSE: AXP)
 
Consolidated total revenues net of interest expense were $6.9 billion, up 13% percent from $6.1 billion a year ago. The increase was the result of the consolidation of securitized cardmember loans and related debt onto the balance sheet in the first quarter. Revenues also reflect higher cardmember spending, offset by a smaller loan portfolio and lower yields on both the securitized and non-securitized portions of the portfolio.
3
Consolidated provisions for losses totaled $652 million compared to $1.6 billion in the year-ago period, reflecting continued improvement in credit quality for the charge and credit card portfolios.
3
Consolidated expenses totaled $4.6 billion, up 13 percent from $4.1 billion a year ago, reflecting higher investment in business building initiatives and higher rewards costs.
The company's return on average equity (ROE) was 23.5 percent, up from 13.2 percent a year ago. Return on average common equity (ROCE) was 23.2 percent,  up from 12 percent a year ago.
Cardmember spending rose 16 percent and improved credit indicators continued the year-long trend that began last spring, said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive officer.
Spending rose across all segments with the largest increases coming from corporate cards, cards issued by our bank partners, charge cards and premium co-brand products where many cardmembers tend to pay in full each month.
 
While the economic environment remains uneven, our net income and billed business are back at, or near, their pre-recession levels. Some of the year-over-year improvement represents an initial return on our investments in the business, but the large percentage increases also reflect comparisons with last year's recessionary levels.
 
 
 
-2-
 
While spending among affluent consumers and businesses remains strong, today's cardmembers are borrowing less and paying down more of their outstanding debt. Over the last several quarters, this has translated into lower interest revenue.
We remain focused on charge  or pay-in-full - products, fee-based revenues, and on expanding our high quality cardmember base. In all, these factors have helped to improve our risk profile during the past year.
We remain cautious about the economy and the challenging regulatory environment. We also recognize that the grow-over comparisons will be more difficult in the second half. Nonetheless, there are significant opportunities to build on the momentum of the last year. We plan to maintain our investments in the business at substantial levels, and dedicate resources to select partnerships and acquisitions.
Year-ago results included $182 million ($118 million after-tax) of net reengineering charges and a $211 million ($135 million after-tax) gain on the sale of a portion of the company's equity holding in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC).
The effective tax rate of 36 percent for the second quarter of 2010 includes the impact of a $44 million tax-related charge.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements
 
This release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to risks and uncertainties.  The forward-looking statements, which address the Companys expected business and financial performance, among other matters, contain words such as believe, expect, anticipate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, may, should, could, would, likely, and similar expressions.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made.  The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. 60; Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following:  the Companys net interest yield on U.S. cardmember loans not trending over time to historical levels as expected, which will be influenced by, among other things, the effects of The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the CARD Act) and regulations adopted pursuant thereto, including the regulations requiring the Company to periodically reevaluate APR increases, interest rates, changes in consumer behavior that affect loan balances, such as paydown rates, the Companys cardmember acquisition strategy, product mix, credit actions, including line size and other adjustments to credit availability, and pricing changes; changes in laws or government regulations, including, in the United States, the impact of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Fran k Act), which is subject to further extensive rulemaking and the implications of which are not fully known at this time; the impact of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act permitting merchants to discount or provide in-kind incentives for the use of one form of payment versus another, which will depend in part on merchants inclination to implement and invest in differentiated pricing and consumers behavior in choosing among different value propositions offered through various payment products; the difference between the Companys discount rate to merchants and the discount rate for debit transactions to be established by the Federal Reserve; the Companys ability to exceed for 2010 its on-average, over-time earnings per share growth target of 12 percent to 15 percent per annum, which will depend on, among other things, the factors described above and below, including the level of consumer and business spending, credit trends, expense management, currency and interest rate flu ctuations and general economic conditions, such as consumer confidence, unemployment, the housing market, the health of state economies and GDP growth; consumer and business spending on the Companys credit and charge card products and Travelers Cheques and other prepaid products and growth in card lending balances, which depend in part on the ability to issue new and enhanced card and prepaid products, services and rewards programs, and increase revenues from such products, attract new cardmembers, reduce cardmember attrition, capture a greater share of existing cardmembers spending, and sustain premium discount rates on its card products in light of regulatory and market pressures, increase merchant coverage, and expand the Global Network Services business; the potential impact of the CARD Act and regulations adopted by federal bank regulators relating to certain credit and charge card practices, including, among others, the imposition by card issuers of interest rate increases on outstanding balances and the allocation of payments in respect of outstanding balances with different interest rates, which could have an adverse impact on the Companys revenues and net income to the extent that the Companys efforts to offset the effects of the legislation and the rules are not effective; the potential impact of the regulations under the CARD Act that limit the fees that may be assessed to cardmembers for late payments, which depends on, among other things, cardmember payment behavior and the number of late paying cardmembers; the Companys ability to manage credit risk related to consumer debt, business loans, merchants and other credit trends, which will depend in part on (i) the economic environment, including, among other things, the housing market, the rates of bankruptcies and unemployment, which can affect spending on card products, debt payments by individual and corporate customers and businesses that accept the Companys card products, (ii) the effectiveness of the Companys credit models and (iii) the impact of recently enacted statutes and proposed legislative initiatives affecting the credit card business, including, without limitation, the CARD Act; the impact of the Companys efforts to deal with delinquent cardmembers in the current challenging economic environment, which may affect payment patterns of cardmembers and the perception of the Companys services, products and brands; the Companys write-off rates over the next several quarters may increase or decrease from current levels, which will depend in part on changes in the level of the Companys loan balances, delinquency rates of cardmembers, including the roll rates of loans going from current to past due status, unemployment rates, the volume of bankruptcies and recoveries of previously written-off loans; fluctuations in interest rates (including fluctuations in benchmarks, such as LIBOR and other benchmark rates that may give rise to basis risk, an d credit spreads), which impact the Companys borrowing costs, return on lending products and the value of the Companys investments; the actual amount to be spent by the Company on investments in the business for the remainder of 2010, including on marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services and certain other operating expenses, which will be based in part on managements assessment of competitive opportunities and the extent of provision benefit, if any, the Company receives from improved credit performance in its card portfolios; the ability to control and manage operating, infrastructure, advertising and promotion expenses as business expands or changes, including the ability to accurately estimate the provision for the cost of the Membership Rewards program; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the Companys ability to grow its business and generate excess capital and earnings in a manner and at levels that will allow the Company to return a portion of capit al to shareholders, which will depend on the Companys ability to manage its capital needs, and the effect of business mix, acquisitions and rating agency and regulatory requirements, including those arising from the Companys status as a bank holding company; the ability of the Company to meet its objectives with respect to the growth of its brokered retail CD program, brokerage sweep account program and its direct deposit initiative, which will depend in part on customer demand, the perception of the Companys brand and regulatory capital requirements; the success of the Global Network Services business in partnering with banks in the United States, which will depend in part on the extent to which such business further enhances the Companys brand, allows the Company to leverage its significant processing scale, expands merchant coverage of the network, provides Global Network Services bank partners in the United States with the benefits of greater cardmember loyalty and high er spend per customer and benefits merchants through, among other things, greater

transaction volume and additional higher spending customers; the ability of the Global Network Services business to meet the performance requirements called for by the Companys settlements with MasterCard and Visa; trends in travel and entertainment spending and the overall level of consumer confidence; the uncertainties associated with business acquisitions, including, among others, the failure to realize anticipated business retention, growth and cost savings, as well as the ability to effectively integrate the acquired business into the Companys existing operations; the success, timeliness and financial impact (including costs, cost savings, and other benefits, including increased revenues), and beneficial effect on the Companys operating expense to revenue ratio, both in the short-term and over time, of reengineering initiatives being implemented or considered by the Company, including cost management, structural and strategic measures such as vendor, process, facilities and operations consolidation, outsourcing (including, among others, technologies operations), relocating certain functions to lower-cost overseas locations, moving internal and external functions to the internet to save costs, and planned staff reductions relating to certain of such reengineering actions, including, the ability of the Company to generate an annualized level of greater than $500 million of gross expense savings by 2012 from reengineering actions in its Global Services unit; the Companys ability to reinvest the benefits arising from such reengineering actions in its businesses; bankruptcies, restructurings, consolidations or similar events affecting the airline or any other industry representing a significant portion of the Companys billed business, including any potential negative effect on particular card products and services and billed business generally that could r esult from the actual or perceived weakness of key business partners in such industries; the triggering of obligations to make payments to certain co-brand partners, merchants, vendors and customers under contractual arrangements with such parties under certain circumstances; a downturn in the Companys businesses and/or negative changes in the Companys and its subsidiaries credit ratings, which could result in contingent payments under contracts, decreased liquidity and higher borrowing costs; the ability of the Company to satisfy its liquidity needs and execute on its funding plans, which will depend on, among other things, the Companys future business growth, its credit ratings, market capacity and demand for securities offered by the Company, performance by the Companys counterparties under its bank credit facilities and other lending facilities, regulatory changes, the Companys ability to securitize and sell receivables and the performance of receivables previous ly sold in securitization transactions; accuracy of estimates for the fair value of the assets in the Companys investment portfolio and, in particular, those investments that are not readily marketable; the Companys ability to invest in technology advances across all areas of its business to stay on the leading edge of technologies applicable to the payments industry; the Companys ability to attract and retain executive management and other key employees; the Companys ability to protect its intellectual property rights (IP) and avoid infringing the IP of other parties; the potential negative effect on the Companys businesses and infrastructure, including information technology, of terrorist attacks, natural disasters, intrusion into our infrastructure by hackers or other catastrophic events in the future; political or economic instability in certain regions or countries, which could affect lending and other commercial activities, among other businesses, or res trictions on convertibility of certain currencies; the potential failure of the United States Congress to extend the active financing exception to Subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code, which could increase the Companys effective tax rate and have an adverse impact on net income; outcomes and costs associated with litigation and compliance and regulatory matters; and competitive pressures in all of the Companys major businesses.  A further description of these and other risks and uncertainties can be found in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2010, and its other reports filed with the SEC.

(A)  Card billed business includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements, and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards.  Card billed business is reflected in the United States or outside the United States based on where the cardmember is domiciled.
 
(B) Total cards-in-force represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding.  Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner and does not include additional supplemental cards issued on that account.  Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force include basic and supplemental cards issued to employee cardmembers.  Non-proprietary basic cards-in-force includes all cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements.
 
(C)  This calculation is designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general purpose American Express cards.  It represents the percentage of billed business (both proprietary and Global Network Services) retained by the Company from merchants it acquires, prior to payments to third parties unrelated to merchant acceptance.
 
(D)  Average basic cardmember spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only.  Average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs, plus card fees included in interest and fees on loans (including related amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs), divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force.  The card fees related to cardmember loans included in interest and fees on loans were $48 million and $45 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The adjusted average fee per card is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs (a portion of which is charge card related and included in net card fees and a portio n of which is lending related and included in interest and fees on loans).  The amount of amortization excluded was $56 million and $62 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  The Company presents adjusted average fee per card because management believes that this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products.

(A)  Represents loss provisions for cardmember receivables consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee reserve components. Adjustments to cardmember receivables resulting from unauthorized transactions have been reclassified from this line to Other for all periods presented.
 
(B) For periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, the Companys cardmember loans and related debt performance information on a GAAP basis was referred to as the owned basis presentation.  The information presented on a GAAP basis for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 includes only non-securitized cardmember loans that were included in the Companys balance sheet. Effective January 1, 2010, the Companys securitized portfolio of cardmember loans and related debt is also consolidated on its balance sheet upon the adoption of GAAP governing the accounting for transfers of financial assets and consolidation of variable interest entities (the new GAAP). Accordingly, beginning January 1, 2010, the GAAP basis presentation includes both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Refer to page 20 for a discussion of  GAAP basis information.
 
(C)  See Appendix III for calculations of net interest yield on cardmember loans, a non-GAAP measure and net interest income divided by average loans, a GAAP measure. The Company believes net interest yield on cardmember loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of the Companys cardmember loans portfolio.
 
(D)  This calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the cardmember loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on cardmember loans. The calculation includes interest income and interest expense attributable to investment securities and other interest-bearing deposits as well as to cardmember loans, and interest expense attributable to other activities, including cardmember receivables.
 
(E)  For periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, information presented is based on the Companys historical non-GAAP, or managed basis presentation. Unlike the GAAP basis presentation, the information presented on a managed basis in such periods includes both the securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans.  The adoption of new GAAP on January 1, 2010  resulted in accounting for both the Companys securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans in the consolidated financial statements.  As a result, the Companys 2010 GAAP presentations and managed basis presentations prior to 2010 are generally comparable.  Refer to page 20 for a discussion of managed basis information.

The adjusted average fee per card is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs (a portion of which is charge card related and included in net card fees and a portion of which is lending related and included in interest and fees on loans).

(B)  Effective January 1, 2010, the Company revised the time period in which past due cardmember receivables in International Card Services and Global Commercial Services are written off when they are 180 days past due or earlier, consistent with applicable bank regulatory guidance and the write-off methodology adopted for U.S. Card Services in the fourth quarter of 2008. Previously, receivables were written off when they were 360 days past billing or earlier. Therefore, the net write-offs for the first quarter of 2010 include net write-offs of approximately $60 million for International Card Services and approximately $48 million for Global Commercial Services resulting from this write-off methodology change, which increased the net loss ratios and decreased the 90 days past billing metrics for these segments , but did not have a substantial impact on provisions for losses. If these amounts had been excluded from net write-offs, the combined net loss ratio for International Card Services/Global Commercial Services for the first quarter of 2010 would have been 0.13%.
(C)  Beginning with the first quarter of 2010, the Company has revised the net loss ratio to exclude net write-offs related to unauthorized transactions, consistent with the methodology for calculation of the net write-off rate for U.S. Card Services. The metrics for prior periods have not been restated for this change as it was deemed immaterial.
 
(D)  For periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, the Companys cardmember loans and related debt performance information on a GAAP basis was referred to as the owned basis presentation. The information presented on a GAAP basis for such periods includes only non-securitized cardmember loans that were included in the Companys balance sheet. Effective January 1, 2010, the Companys securitized portfolio of cardmember loans and related debt is also consolidated on its balance sheet upon the adoption of the new GAAP. Accordingly, beginning January 1, 2010, the GAAP basis presentation includes both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans . Refer to page 20 for a discussion of  GAAP basis information.
 
(E)  Reflects the new GAAP effective January 1, 2010, which resulted in the consolidation of the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust), reflecting $29.0 billion of additional cardmember loans along with a $2.5 billion loan loss reserve on the Companys balance sheets.
 
(F)  See Appendix III for calculations of net interest yield on cardmember loans, a non-GAAP measure and net interest income divided by average loans, a GAAP measure. The Company believes net interest yield on cardmember loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of the Companys cardmember loans portfolio.
 
(G)  This calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the cardmember loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on cardmember loans. The calculation includes interest income and interest expense attributable to investment securities and other interest-bearing deposits as well as to cardmember loans, and interest expense attributable to other activities, including cardmember receivables.
 
(H)  For periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, information presented is based on the Companys historical non-GAAP, or managed basis presentation. Unlike the GAAP basis presentation, the information presented on a managed basis in such periods includes both the securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. The adoption of new GAAP on January 1, 2010  resulted in accounting for both the Companys securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, the Companys 2010 GAAP presentations and managed basis presentations prior to 2010 are generally comparable.  Refer to page 20 for a discussion of managed basis information.

The following table sets forth portfolio financial information for the quarters ended June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2009. The June 30, 2010 financial information was determined in accordance with the new GAAP effective January 1, 2010. The June 30, 2009 information includes the GAAP (owned basis) presentation, together with the adjustments for securitization activity to arrive at the managed (non-GAAP) basis presentation. For additional information, see Cardmember Loan Portfolio Presentations below.
 
 
(A) In accordance with the new GAAP effective January 1, 2010, the Company no longer reports securitization income, net in its income statement.
 
(B) Includes provisions for losses for off-balance sheet cardmember loans based on the same methodology as applied to on-balance sheet cardmember loans, except that any quarterly adjustment to reserve levels for on-balance sheet loans to address external environmental factors was not applied to adjust the provision expense for the securitized portfolio. 
For periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, the Companys non-securitized cardmember loans and related debt performance information on a GAAP basis was referred to as the owned basis presentation. For such periods, the Company also provided such information on a non-GAAP managed basis. Unlike the GAAP basis presentation, the managed basis presentation in such periods assumed there had been no off-balance sheet securitizations for the Companys U.S. Card Services segment (the Company does not currently securitize its international cardmember loans), resulting in the inclusion of all securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans and related debt in the Companys performance information.
Under the GAAP basis presentation for periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, prior to a securitization, revenues and expenses from cardmember loans and related debt were reflected in the Companys income statements in other commissions and fees, net interest income and provisions for losses for cardmember loans. At the time of a securitization transaction, the securitized cardmember loans were removed from the Companys balance sheet, and the resulting gain on sale was reflected in securitization income, net, as well as a reduction to provisions for losses (credit reserves were no longer recorded for the cardmember loans once sold). Over the life of a securitization transaction, the Company recognized the net cash flow from interest and fee collections on interests sold to investors (the investors&# 8217; interests) after deducting interest paid on the investors certificates, credit losses, contractual service fees, other expenses and changes in the fair value of the interest-only strip (referred to as excess spread). These amounts, in addition to servicing fees and the non-credit components of the gains/(losses) from securitization activities were reflected in securitization income, net. The Company also recognized interest income over the life of the securitization transaction related to the interest it retained (i.e., the sellers interest).
 
At the maturity of a securitization transaction, cardmember loans on the balance sheet increased, and the impact of the incremental required loss reserves was recorded in provisions for losses.
 
Under the managed basis presentation for periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, revenues and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans and related debt are reflected in other commissions and fees (included in discount revenue, net card fees and other), interest income, interest expense and provisions for losses. In addition, there is no securitization income, net as this presentation assumes no securitization transactions have occurred.
 
Historically, the Company included U.S. Card Services information on a managed basis, as that was the manner in which the Companys management viewed and managed the business. Management believed that a full picture of trends in the Companys cardmember loans business could only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans, as the presentation of the entire cardmember loan portfolio was more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and related trends over time. The managed basis presentation also provided investors a more comprehensive assessment of the information necessary for the Company and investors to evaluate the Companys market share.
 
The adoption of new GAAP on January 1, 2010 resulted in accounting for both the Companys securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans in the consolidated financial statements.  As a result, the Companys 2010 GAAP presentations and managed basis presentations prior to 2010 are generally comparable.

CONSOLIDATED
CAPITAL
On July 29, 2009, the Company repurchased the warrants issued under the CPP Program for $340MM, which provided the Treasury with an annualized return on the Companys CPP participation of 26%.  The warrant repurchase resulted in a reduction of cash and corresponding adjustment to Retained Earnings and Additional Paid-In Capital on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet.  There was no impact to the Companys net income or EPS.
No shares have been repurchased over the last nine quarters, as share repurchases were suspended during Q108 in light of the challenging global economic environment and limitations while participating in the CPP.  Since the inception of repurchase programs in December 1994, 670MM shares have been acquired under cumulative Board authorizations to repurchase up to 770MM shares.  On a cumulative basis, since 1994 the Company has distributed 65% of capital generated through share repurchases and dividends.

FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY
 
The weighted average original and remaining maturity on outstanding U.S. retail Certificate of Deposits (CDs) was 32 and 21 months, respectively. The average rate at issuance was 2.4%.
 
During the second quarter of 2010 the Company adjusted its deposit strategy to focus on direct deposits gathered through Personal Savings from American Express, in particular the High Yield Savings Account and longer tenored CDs, rather than CDs distributed through third party distribution channels.
 
The Company offers deposits within its American Express Centurion Bank and American Express Bank, FSB (FSB) subsidiaries (together, the Banks).  These funds are insured up to $250,000 through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  During Q209, the Company, through FSB, launched a direct deposit-taking program, Personal Savings from American Express, to supplement its distribution of deposit products through third-party distribution channels.  This program makes FDIC-insured CDs and high-yield savings account products available directly to consumers.
The Company currently has an objective to hold excess cash and readily marketable securities to satisfy all maturing long-term funding obligations for a 12-month period, in addition to having access to significant additional contingent liquidity sources in the event that access to its primary funding sources should become unavailable.  As of June 30, 2010, the Company held $25B of excess cash and readily marketable securities versus $20B of long-term debt and CDs maturing over the next twelve months.

OTHER ITEMS OF NOTE
As the Company has previously indicated, beginning in Q309, benefits related to better than initially forecasted credit and business trends for 2009, which have continued into 2010, were utilized to increase spending on marketing and other business-building initiatives during the second half of the year.  This has reduced the expected carryover into 2010 of the reengineering benefits previously discussed in 2009 related to investment spending and position eliminations, although the employee count decline of 7,500, or 11%, since September 30, 2008, primarily due to these initiatives, will continue to provide benefits.
In Q210, income from continuing operations reflects $4MM ($3MM after-tax) of net reengineering benefit.
 
Under the terms of the settlement agreements, the Company will receive aggregate maximum payments of up to $2.25B from Visa and $1.8B from MasterCard.  The settlement with Visa is comprised of an initial payment of $1.13B ($700MM after-tax) that was recorded in Q407 and received in March 2008, and quarterly payments of up to $70MM ($43MM after-tax) for four years from Q108 through Q411. The settlement with MasterCard is comprised of quarterly payments of up to $150MM ($93MM after-tax) for three years from Q308 through Q211.  The Company recognized $70MM from Visa for each of the past ten quarters and $150MM from MasterCard for each of the past eight quarters pursuant to these agreements.
The installment payments from both parties are subject to the Company achieving certain quarterly performance criteria in the Global Network Services (GNS) business within the U.S., which the Company believes it is positioned to meet.  Payments earned through June 2010 have been recorded as a reduction to the other, net expense line within the Corporate & Other segment.

Supplemental Information  Tangible Common Equity and Total Adjusted Assets
During the third quarter of 2006, the Company issued $750MM of 6.80% Subordinated Debentures due 2036 (Subordinated Debentures), which are automatically extendable until 2066 unless certain events occur prior to that date. In connection with the Subordinated Debentures, the Company has undertaken to disclose on a quarterly basis the amount of its tangible common equity and total adjusted assets, as defined in the Subordinated Debentures.  The Companys consolidated tangible common equity amount as of the end of any fiscal quarter means the total shareholders equity, excluding preferred stock, of the Company as reflected on its consolidated balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP as of such fiscal quarter end minus (i) intangible assets and goodwill an d (ii) deferred acquisition costs, as determined in accordance with GAAP and reflected in such consolidated balance sheet.  The Companys total adjusted assets as of the end of any fiscal quarter is calculated as the sum of (i) total consolidated assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet minus (ii) non-securitized Cardmember loan receivables (without deduction for reserves), which are set forth on the Companys balance sheet, plus (iii) managed (i.e., securitized and non-securitized) worldwide Cardmember loan receivables as reported by the Company for such fiscal quarter.  Upon the adoption of new GAAP effective  January 1, 2010, the Companys total consolidated assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet now are the same amount as would be calculated as total adjusted assets as defined in the Subordinated Debentures before the change in GAAP.  As of June 30, 2010, the Company ;s tangible common equity was $11B and its total adjusted assets as defined in the Subordinated Debentures, were $144B.  As of June 30, 2010, the consolidated assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet were also $144B.

Cardmember Loan Portfolio Presentations
 
For periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, the Companys non-securitized cardmember loans and related debt performance information on a GAAP basis was referred to as the owned basis presentation. For such periods, the Company also provided such information on a non-GAAP managed basis. Unlike the GAAP basis presentation, the managed basis presentation in such periods  assumed there had been no off-balance sheet securitizations for the Companys USCS segment (the Company does not currently securitize its international cardmember loans), resulting in the inclusion of all securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans and related debt in the Companys performance information.
 
Under the GAAP basis presentation prior to a securitization for periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, revenues and expenses from cardmember loans and related debt were reflected in the Companys income statements in other commissions and fees, net interest income and provisions for losses for cardmember loans. At the time of a securitization transaction, the securitized cardmember loans were removed from the Companys balance sheet, and the resulting gain on sale was reflected in securitization income, net, as well as a reduction to provisions for losses (credit reserves were no longer recorded for the cardmember loans once sold). Over the life of a securitization transaction, the Company recognized the net cash flow from interest and fee collections on interests sold to investors (the investors interests) after deducting interest paid on the investors certificates, credit losses, contractual service fees, other expenses and changes in the fair value of the interest-only strip (referred to as excess spread). These amounts, in addition to servicing fees and the non-credit components of the gains/(losses) from securitization activities were reflected in securitization income, net. The Company also recognized interest income over the life of the securitization transaction related to the interest it retained (i.e., the sellers interest). At the maturity of a securitization transaction, cardmember loans on the balance sheet increased, and the impact of the incremental required loss reserves was recorded in provisions for losses.
 
Under the managed basis presentation for periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, revenues and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans and related debt are reflected in other commissions and fees (included in discount revenue, net card fees and other), interest income, interest expense and provisions for losses. In addition, there is no securitization income, net as this presentation assumes no securitization transactions have occurred.
 
Historically, the Company included USCS information on a managed basis, as that was the manner in which the Companys management viewed and managed the business. Management believed that a full picture of trends in the Companys cardmember loans business could only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans, as the presentation of the entire cardmember loan portfolio was more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and related trends over time. The managed basis presentation also provided investors a more comprehensive assessment of the information necessary for the Company and investors to evaluate the Companys market share.
 
The adoption of new GAAP on January 1, 2010 resulted in accounting for both the Companys securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans in the consolidated financial statements.  As a result, the Companys 2010 GAAP presentations and managed basis presentations prior to 2010 are generally comparable.
 
For additional information on the differences between the Companys historical GAAP and managed basis presentations, see the Companys 2009 Financial Review included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2009.

The following table sets forth portfolio financial information for Q210 and Q209.  The Q210 financial information was determined in accordance with the new GAAP  effective January 1, 2010.  The Q209 information includes the GAAP (owned) basis presentation, together with the adjustments for securitization activity to arrive at the managed (non-GAAP)  basis presentation.  For additional information, please see the Cardmember Loan Portfolio Presentations discussion on page 17.

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made.  The Company undertakes no obligation t o update or revise any forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following:  the Companys ability to exceed for 2010 its on-average, over-time earnings per share growth target of 12 percent to 15 percent per annum, which will depend on, among other things, the factors described below, including the level of consumer and business spending, credit trends, expense management, currency and interest rate fluctuations and general economic conditions, such as unemployment and GDP growth; the Companys ability to manage credit risk related to consumer debt, business loans, merchants and other credit trends, which will depend in part on (i) the economic environment, including, among other things, the housing market, the rates of bankruptcies and unemployment, which can affect spending on card products, debt payments by individual and corporate customers and busine sses that accept the Companys card products, (ii) the effectiveness of the Companys credit models and (iii) the impact of recently enacted statutes and proposed legislative initiatives affecting the credit card business, including, without limitation, The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the CARD Act); the impact of the Companys efforts to deal with delinquent cardmembers in the current challenging economic environment, which may affect payment patterns of cardmembers and the perception of the Companys services, products and brands; the Companys near-term write-off rates, including those for the second quarter of 2010, which will depend in part on changes in the level of the Companys loan balances, delinquency rates of cardmembers, unemployment rates, the volume of bankruptcies and recoveries of previously written-off loans; consumer and business spending on the Companys credit and charge card products and Tra velers Cheques and other prepaid products and growth in card lending balances, which depend in part on the economic environment, and the ability to issue new and enhanced card and prepaid products, services and rewards programs, and increase revenues from such products, attract new cardmembers, reduce cardmember attrition, capture a greater share of existing cardmembers spending, and sustain premium discount rates on its card products in light of regulatory and market pressures, increase merchant coverage, retain cardmembers after low introductory lending rates have expired, and expand the Global Network Services business; the write-off and delinquency rates in the medium- to long-term of cardmembers added by the Company during the past few years, which could impact their profitability to the Company; the Companys ability to effectively implement changes in the pricing of certain of its products and services; fluctuations in interest rates (including fluctuations in benchmarks, such as LIBOR an d other benchmark rates that may give rise to basis risk, and credit spreads), which impact the Companys borrowing costs, return on lending products and the value of the Companys investments; the Companys net interest yield on cardmember loans trending downward over time closer to historical levels, which will be impacted by the affects of the CARD Act and changes in consumer behavior that affect loan balances; the actual amount to be spent by the Company on marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services based on managements assessment of competitive opportunities and other factors affecting its judgment and during 2010, the extent of provision benefit, if any, from lower than expected write-offs; the ability to control and manage operating, infrastructure, advertising and promotion expenses as business expands or changes, including the ability to accurately estimate the provision for the cost of the Membership Rewards program; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate s; the Companys ability to grow its business and generate excess capital and earnings in a manner and at levels that will allow the Company to return a portion of capital to shareholders, which will depend on the Companys ability to manage its capital needs, and the effect of business mix, acquisitions and rating agency and regulatory requirements, including those arising from the Companys status as a bank holding company; the ability of the Company to meet its objectives with respect to the growth of its brokered retail CD program, brokerage sweep account program and the direct deposit initiative, which will depend in part on customer demand, the perception of the Companys brand and regulatory capital requirements; the success of the Global Network Services business in partnering with banks in the United States, which will depend in part on the extent to which such business further enhances the Companys brand, allows the Company to leverage its significant processing scale , expands merchant coverage of the network, provides Global Network Services bank partners in the United States with the benefits of greater cardmember loyalty and higher spend per customer  and benefits merchants through, among other things, greater transaction volume and additional higher spending customers; the ability of the Global Network Services business to meet the performance requirements called for by the Companys settlements with MasterCard and Visa; trends in travel and entertainment spending and the overall level of consumer confidence; the uncertainties associated with business acquisitions, including, among others, the failure to realize anticipated business retention, growth and cost savings, as well as the ability to effectively integrate the acquired business into the Companys existing operations; the success, timeliness and financial impact (including costs, cost savings, and other benefits, including increased revenues), and beneficial effect on the Company& #8217;s operating expense to revenue ratio, both in the short-term and over time, of reengineering initiatives being implemented or considered by the Company, including cost management, structural and strategic measures such as vendor, process, facilities and operations consolidation, outsourcing (including, among others, technologies operations), relocating certain functions to lower-cost overseas locations, moving internal and external functions to the internet to save costs, and planned staff reductions relating to certain of such reengineering actions, including, the ability of the Company to generate an annualized level of greater than $500 million of gross expense savings by 2012 from reengineering actions in its Global Services unit; the Companys ability to reinvest the benefits arising from such reengineering actions in its businesses; bankruptcies, restructurings, consolidations or similar events affecting the airline or any other industry representing a significant portion of the CompanyR 17;s billed business, including any potential negative effect on particular card products and services and billed business generally that could result from the actual or perceived weakness of key business partners in such industries; the triggering of obligations to make payments to certain co-brand partners, merchants, vendors and customers under contractual arrangements with such parties under certain circumstances; a downturn in the Companys businesses and/or negative changes in the Companys and its subsidiaries credit ratings, which could result in contingent payments under contracts, decreased liquidity and higher borrowing costs; the ability of the Company to satisfy its liquidity needs and execute on its funding plans, which will depend on, among other things, the Companys future business growth, its credit ratings, market capacity and demand for securities offered by the Company, performance by the Companys counterparties under its bank credit facilities and other l ending facilities, regulatory changes, including changes to the policies, rules and regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the Companys ability to securitize and sell receivables and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions; accuracy of estimates for the fair value of the assets in the Companys investment portfolio and, in particular, those investments that are not readily marketable; the ability of the Companys charge card and lending trusts to maintain excess spreads at levels sufficient to avoid material set-asides or early amortization of the Companys charge card and lending securitizations, which will depend on various factors such as income derived from the relevant portfolios and their respective credit performances; the increase in excess spread resulting from the designation of discount option receivables with respect to the American Express Credit Account Mast er Trust, which will depend in part on the monthly principal payment rate posted to accounts in, and the credit performance of, the securitized lending portfolio; the Companys ability to invest in technology advances across all areas of its business to stay on the leading edge of technologies applicable to the payments industry; the Companys ability to attract and retain executive management and other key employees; the Companys ability to protect its intellectual property rights (IP) and avoid infringing the IP of other parties; the potential negative effect on the Companys businesses and infrastructure, including information technology, of terrorist attacks, natural disasters, intrusion into our infrastructure by hackers or other catastrophic events in the future; political or economic instability in certain regions or countries, which could affect lending and other commercial activities, among other businesses, or restrictions on convertibility of certain currenci es; changes in laws or government regulations; the administrations proposal to impose a Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee at the rate of approximately 15 basis points on certain liabilities of banks, bank holding companies and other financial institutions with consolidated assets of at least $50 billion; the potential failure of the U.S. Congress to extend the active financing exception to Subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code, which could increase the Companys effective tax rate and have an adverse impact on net income; the potential impact of the CARD Act and regulations adopted by federal bank regulators relating to certain credit and charge card practices, including, among others, the imposition by card issuers of interest rate increases on outstanding balances and the allocation of payments in respect of outstanding balances with different interest rates, which could have an adverse impact on the Companys net income; accounting changes, including the implementation of changes to the accounting for off-balance sheet activities or other potential regulatory interpretations in this area, which, effective January 1, 2010, required the Company to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the lending securitization trust, thereby requiring the Company to reestablish loss reserves, which has in turn resulted in a reduction to the Companys regulatory capital ratios and has also resulted in a change with respect to the presentation of its financial statements beginning with the first quarter of 2010, and which also could result in lower credit ratings on securities issued by the Companys off-balance sheet securitization trusts as a result of the uncertainty with respect to the ability of rating agencies to continue to rely on the FDICs safe harbor rule regarding the isolation of securitized assets in the event of a sponsoring banks receivership or conservatorship, which in turn could adversely impact the Companys ability to utilize securitizations as a comp onent of its funding strategy; outcomes and costs associated with litigation and compliance and regulatory matters; and competitive pressures in all of the Companys major businesses.  A further description of these and other risks and uncertainties can be found in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and the Companys other reports filed with the SEC.
