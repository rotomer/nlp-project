FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
# Denotes a variance of more than 100%

New York  October 21, 2010 -today reported third-quarter net income of $1.1 billion, up 71 percent from $640 million a year ago. Diluted per share net income was $0.90, up 70 percent from $0.53 a year ago.
American Express Company (NYSE: AXP)
 
Consolidated total revenues net of interest expense were $7.0 billion, up 17 percent from $6.0 billion a year ago.  The increase reflects the consolidation of securitized cardmember loans and related debt onto the balance sheet in the first quarter. Revenues also reflect higher cardmember spending and higher travel commissions and fees, offset by lower interest income due to a smaller loan portfolio and lower yields on both the securitized and non-securitized portions of the portfolio.
3
Consolidated provisions for losses totaled $373 million compared to $1.2 billion in the year-ago period, reflecting continued improvement in credit quality for the charge and credit card portfolios.
3
Consolidated expenses totaled $5.0 billion, up 28 percent from $3.9 billion a year ago, reflecting higher investment in business building initiatives and higher rewards costs.
The company's return on average equity (ROE) was 25.9 percent, up from 11.7 percent a year ago.
Cardmember spending rose a strong 14 percent with the largest increases coming from businesses where weve been making significant investments: charge and premium co-brand products, corporate cards and cards issued by our bank partners, said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive officer.
Lending volumes, however, remain below pre-recessionary levels as cardmembers continued to manage their finances carefully and pay down outstanding debt. While this translated into lower net interest income, it also helped to improve our overall risk profile.
Our credit indicators, in fact, continued to lead the market and our write-off rate dropped below 5 percent in September for the first time since early 2008.
Against the backdrop of regulatory and legislative changes that are reshaping the industry, we have been able to improve our competitive position relative to those issuers who rely more heavily on revolving credit and back-end fees.
While we remain cautious about the economic outlook, we plan to capitalize on that advantage by investing to strengthen relationships with high spending cardmembers and the merchants who accept our products.

(A)  Card billed business includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements (non-proprietary billed business), and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards.  In-store spend activity within retail co-brand portfolios in Global Network Services, from which the Company earns no revenue, is not included in non-proprietary billed business.  Card billed business is reflected in the United States or outside the United States based on where the cardmember is domiciled.
(B)  Total cards-in-force represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding.  Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner and does not include additional supplemental cards issued on that account.  Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force include basic and supplemental cards issued to employee cardmembers.  Non-proprietary cards-in-force includes all cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for retail co-brand cardmember accounts which have no out-of-store spend activity during the prior 12 month period.
(C)  This calculation is designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general purpose American Express cards.  It represents the percentage of billed business (both proprietary and Global Network Services) retained by the Company from merchants it acquires, prior to payments to third parties unrelated to merchant acceptance.
(D)  Average basic cardmember spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only.  Average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs, plus card fees included in interest and fees on loans (including related amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs), divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force.  The card fees related to cardmember loans included in interest and fees on loans were $58 million and $47 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The adjusted average fee per card is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs (a portion of which is charge card related and included in net card fe es and a portion of which is lending related and included in interest and fees on loans).  The amount of amortization excluded was $49 million and $57 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  The Company presents adjusted average fee per card because management believes that this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products.

(A)  Represents loss provisions for cardmember receivables consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee reserve components. Adjustments to cardmember receivables resulting from unauthorized transactions have been reclassified from this line to "Other" for all periods presented.
(B) For periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, the Companys cardmember loans and related debt performance information on a GAAP basis was referred to as the "owned" basis presentation.  The information presented on a GAAP basis for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 includes only non-securitized cardmember loans that were included in the Companys balance sheet. Effective January 1, 2010, the Companys securitized portfolio of cardmember loans and related debt is also consolidated on its balance sheet upon the adoption of GAAP governing the accounting for transfers of financial assets and consolidation of variable interest entities (the new GAAP). Accordingly, beginning January 1, 2010, the GAAP basis presentation includes both securitized and non-securitized cardmem ber loans. Refer to page 19 for a discussion of  GAAP basis information.
 
(C)  See Appendix III for calculations of net interest yield on cardmember loans, a non-GAAP measure and net interest income divided by average loans, a GAAP measure. Management believes net interest yield on cardmember loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of the Companys cardmember loans portfolio.
(D)  This calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the cardmember loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on cardmember loans. The calculation includes interest income and interest expense attributable to investment securities and other interest-bearing deposits as well as to cardmember loans, and interest expense attributable to other activities, including cardmember receivables.
(E)  For periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, information presented is based on the Companys historical non-GAAP, or managed basis presentation. Unlike the GAAP basis presentation, the information presented on a managed basis in such periods includes both the securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans.  The adoption of new GAAP on January 1, 2010  resulted in accounting for both the Company's securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans in the consolidated financial statements.  As a result, the Company's 2010 GAAP presentations and managed basis presentations prior to 2010 are generally comparable. Refer to page 19 for a discussion of managed basis information.

(A)  Represents loss provisions for cardmember receivables consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee reserve components. Adjustments to cardmember receivables resulting from unauthorized transactions have been reclassified from this line to "Other" for all periods presented.
(B)  Effective January 1, 2010, the Company revised the time period in which past due cardmember receivables in International Card Services and Global Commercial Services are written off to when they are 180 days past due or earlier, consistent with applicable bank regulatory guidance and the write-off methodology adopted for U.S. Card Services in the fourth quarter of 2008. Previously, receivables were written off when they were 360 days past billing or earlier. Therefore, the net write-offs for the first quarter of 2010 include net write-offs of approximately $60 million for International Card Services and approximately $48 million for Global Commercial Services resulting from this write-off methodology change, which increased the net loss ratios and decreased the 90 days past billing metrics for these segme nts, but did not have a substantial impact on provisions for losses. If these amounts had been excluded from net write-offs, the combined net loss ratio for International Card Services/Global Commercial Services for the first quarter of 2010 would have been 0.13%.
(C)  Beginning with the first quarter of 2010, the Company has revised the net loss ratio to exclude net write-offs related to unauthorized transactions, consistent with the methodology for calculation of the net write-off rate for U.S. Card Services. The metrics for prior periods have not been revised for this change as it was deemed immaterial.
(D) For periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, the Company's cardmember loans and related debt performance information on a GAAP basis was referred to as the "owned" basis presentation. The information presented on a GAAP basis for such periods includes only non-securitized cardmember loans that were included in the Companys balance sheet. Effective January 1, 2010, the Companys securitized portfolio of cardmember loans and related debt is also consolidated on its balance sheet upon the adoption of the new GAAP. Accordingly, beginning January 1, 2010, the GAAP basis presentation includes both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans . Refer to page 19 for a discussion of  GAAP basis information.

(F)  See Appendix III for calculations of net interest yield on cardmember loans, a non-GAAP measure and net interest income divided by average loans, a GAAP measure. Management believes net interest yield on cardmember loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of the Companys cardmember loans portfolio.
(G)  This calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the cardmember loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on cardmember loans. The calculation includes interest income and interest expense attributable to investment securities and other interest-bearing deposits as well as to cardmember loans, and interest expense attributable to other activities, including cardmember receivables.

(B) Includes provisions for losses for off-balance sheet cardmember loans based on the same methodology as applied to on-balance sheet cardmember loans, except that any quarterly adjustment to reserve levels for on-balance sheet loans to address external environmental factors was not applied to adjust the provision expense for the securitized portfolio.
Cardmember Loan Portfolio Presentation
For periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, the Companys non-securitized cardmember loans and related debt performance information on a GAAP basis was referred to as the owned basis presentation. For such periods, the Company also provided information on a non-GAAP managed basis. Unlike the GAAP basis presentation, the managed basis presentation in such periods assumed there had been no off-balance sheet securitizations for the Companys U.S. Card Services segment (the Company does not currently securitize its international cardmember loans), resulting in the inclusion of all securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans and related debt in the Companys performance information.
Under the GAAP basis presentation prior to securitization for periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, revenues and expenses from cardmember loans and related debt were reflected in the Companys income statements in other commissions and fees, net interest income and provisions for losses for cardmember loans. At the time of a securitization transaction, the securitized cardmember loans were removed from the Companys balance sheet, and the resulting gain on sale was reflected in securitization income, net, as well as a reduction to provisions for losses (credit reserves were no longer recorded for the cardmember loans once sold). Over the life of a securitization transaction, the Company recognized the net cash flow from interest and fee collections on interests sold to investors (the investors 7; interests) after deducting interest paid on the investors certificates, credit losses, contractual service fees, other expenses and changes in the fair value of the interest-only strip (referred to as excess spread).  These amounts, in addition to servicing fees and the non-credit components of the gains/(losses) from securitization activities were reflected in securitization income, net. The Company also recognized interest income over the life of the securitization transaction related to the interest it retained (i.e., the sellers interest).
At the maturity of a securitization transaction, cardmember loans on the balance sheet increased, and the impact of the incremental required loss reserves was recorded in provisions for losses.
Under the managed basis presentation for periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, revenues and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans and related debt were reflected in other commissions and fees (included in discount revenue, net card fees and other), interest income, interest expense and provisions for losses. In addition, there was no securitization income, net as this presentation assumed no securitization transactions had occurred.
Historically, the Company included U.S. Card Services information on a managed basis, as that was the manner in which the Companys management viewed and managed the business. Management believed that a full picture of trends in the Companys cardmember loans business could only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans, as the presentation of the entire cardmember loan portfolio was more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and related trends over time. The managed basis presentation also provided investors a more comprehensive assessment of the information necessary for the Company and investors to evaluate the Companys market share.
The adoption of new GAAP on January 1, 2010 resulted in accounting for both the Company's securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans in the consolidated financial statements.  As a result, the Company's 2010 GAAP presentations and managed basis presentations prior to 2010 are generally comparable.

(B) Refer to Appendix II for components of return on average segment capital and return on average tangible segment capital.
(C) Effective January 1, 2010, the Company revised the time period in which past due cardmember receivables in International Card Services are written off to when they are 180 days past due or earlier, consistent with applicable bank regulatory guidance and the write-off methodology adopted for U.S. Card Services in the fourth quarter of 2008. Previously, receivables were written off when they were 360 days past billing or earlier. Therefore, the net write-offs for the first quarter of 2010 include net write-offs of approximately $60 million for International Card Services resulting from this write-off methodology change, which increased the net loss ratio and decreased the 90 days past billing metric for this segment, but did not have a substantial impact on provisions for losses. If this amount had been excluded from net write-offs, the net loss ratio for International Card Services for the first quarter of 2010 would have been 0.17%.
(D) Beginning with the first quarter of 2010, the Company has revised the net loss ratio to exclude net write-offs related to unauthorized transactions, consistent with the methodology for calculation of the net write-off rate for U.S. Card Services.

Previously, receivables were written off when they were 360 days past billing or earlier. Therefore, the net write-offs for the first quarter of 2010 include net write-offs of approximately $48 million for Global Commercial Services resulting from this write-off methodology change, which increased the net loss ratio and decreased the 90 days past billing metric for this segment, but did not have a substantial impact on provisions for losses. If this amount had been exclu ded from net write-offs, the net loss ratio for Global Commercial Services for the first quarter of 2010 would have been 0.11%.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

CAPITAL
On July 29, 2009, the Company repurchased the warrants issued under the CPP Program for $340MM, which provided the Treasury with an annualized return on the Companys CPP participation of 26%.  The warrant repurchase resulted in a reduction of cash and corresponding adjustment to Retained Earnings and Additional Paid-In Capital on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet.  There was no impact to the Companys net income or EPS.
No shares have been repurchased over the last ten quarters, as share repurchases were suspended during Q108 in light of the challenging global economic environment and limitations while participating in the CPP.
Since the inception of repurchase programs in December 1994, 670MM shares have been acquired under cumulative Board authorizations to repurchase up to 770MM shares.  On a cumulative basis, since 1994 the Company has distributed 64% of capital generated through share repurchases and dividends.

FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY
 
The weighted average original and remaining maturity on outstanding U.S. retail Certificate of Deposits (CDs) was 34 and 20 months, respectively. The average rate at issuance was 2.6%.
During the third quarter of 2010, the Company continued to focus its deposit strategy on direct deposits gathered through Personal Savings from American Express, in particular the High Yield Savings Account, rather than CDs distributed through third-party distribution channels.
The Company offers deposits within its American Express Centurion Bank and American Express Bank, FSB (FSB) subsidiaries (together, the Banks).  These funds are insured up to $250,000 per account through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  During Q209, the Company, through FSB, launched a direct deposit-taking program, Personal Savings from American Express, to supplement its distribution of deposit products through third-party distribution channels.  This program makes FDIC-insured CDs and high-yield savings account products available directly to consumers.
The Company currently has an objective to hold excess cash and readily marketable securities to satisfy all maturing long-term funding obligations for a 12-month period, in addition to having access to significant additional contingent liquidity sources in the event that access to its primary funding sources should become unavailable.  As of September 30, 2010, the Company held $27B of excess cash and readily marketable securities versus $18B of long-term debt and CDs maturing over the next 12 months.

Supplemental Information  Tangible Common Equity and Total Adjusted Assets
During the third quarter of 2006, the Company issued $750MM of 6.80% Subordinated Debentures due 2036 (Subordinated Debentures), which are automatically extendable until 2066 unless certain events occur prior to that date. In connection with the Subordinated Debentures, the Company has undertaken to disclose on a quarterly basis the amount of its tangible common equity and total adjusted assets, as defined in the Subordinated Debentures.  The Companys consolidated tangible common equity amount as of the end of any fiscal quarter means the total shareholders equity, excluding preferred stock, of the Company as reflected on its consolidated balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP as of such fiscal quarter end minus (i) intangible assets and good will and (ii) deferred acquisition costs, as determined in accordance with GAAP and reflected in such consolidated balance sheet.  The Companys total adjusted assets as of the end of any fiscal quarter is calculated as the sum of (i) total consolidated assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet minus (ii) non-securitized Cardmember loan receivables (without deduction for reserves), which are set forth on the Companys balance sheet, plus (iii) managed (i.e., securitized and non-securitized) worldwide Cardmember loan receivables as reported by the Company for such fiscal quarter.  Upon the adoption of new GAAP effective  January 1, 2010, the Companys total consolidated assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet now are the same amount as would be calculated as total adjusted assets as defined in the Subordinated Debentures before the change in GAAP.  As of September 30, 2010, the C ompanys tangible common equity was $13B and its total adjusted assets as defined in the Subordinated Debentures, were $146B.  As of September 30, 2010, the consolidated assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet were also $146B.

For periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, the Companys non-securitized cardmember loans and related debt performance information on a GAAP basis was referred to as the owned basis presentation. For such periods, the Company also provided information on a non-GAAP managed basis. Unlike the GAAP basis presentation, the managed basis presentation in such periods  assumed there had been no off-balance sheet securitizations for the Companys USCS segment (the Company does not currently securitize its international cardmember loans), resulting in the inclusion of all securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans and related debt in the Companys performance information.
Under the GAAP basis presentation prior to a securitization for periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, revenues and expenses from cardmember loans and related debt were reflected in the Companys income statements in other commissions and fees, net interest income and provisions for losses for cardmember loans. At the time of a securitization transaction, the securitized cardmember loans were removed from the Companys balance sheet, and the resulting gain on sale was reflected in securitization income, net, as well as a reduction to provisions for losses (credit reserves were no longer recorded for the cardmember loans once sold). Over the life of a securitization transaction, the Company recognized the net cash flow from interest and fee collections on interests sold to investors (the investors inte rests) after deducting interest paid on the investors certificates, credit losses, contractual service fees, other expenses and changes in the fair value of the interest-only strip (referred to as excess spread). These amounts, in addition to servicing fees and the non-credit components of the gains/(losses) from securitization activities, were reflected in securitization income, net. The Company also recognized interest income over the life of the securitization transaction related to the interest it retained (i.e., the sellers interest). At the maturity of a securitization transaction, cardmember loans on the balance sheet increased, and the impact of the incremental required loss reserves was recorded in provisions for losses.
Under the managed basis presentation for periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, revenues and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans and related debt were reflected in other commissions and fees (included in discount revenue, net card fees and other), interest income, interest expense and provisions for losses. In addition, there was no securitization income, net as this presentation assumed no securitization transactions had occurred.
Historically, the Company included USCS information on a managed basis, as that was the manner in which the Companys management viewed and managed the business. Management believed that a full picture of trends in the Companys cardmember loans business could only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans, as the presentation of the entire cardmember loan portfolio was more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and related trends over time. The managed basis presentation also provided investors a more comprehensive assessment of the information necessary for the Company and investors to evaluate the Companys market share.
The adoption of new GAAP on January 1, 2010 resulted in accounting for both the Companys securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans in the consolidated financial statements.  As a result, the Companys 2010 GAAP presentations and managed basis presentations prior to 2010 are generally comparable.
For additional information on the differences between the Companys historical GAAP and managed basis presentations, see the Companys 2009 Financial Review included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.
