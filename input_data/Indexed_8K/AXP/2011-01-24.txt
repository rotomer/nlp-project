New York  January 24, 2011 -today reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.1 billion, up 48 percent from $716 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share was $0.88, up 47 percent from $0.60 a year ago. The results include $113 million ($74 million after-tax) of previously announced restructuring and other reengineering costs. Excluding these costs, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.94.
American Express Company (NYSE: AXP)
3
Consolidated total revenues net of interest expense were $7.3 billion, up 13 percent from $6.5 billion a year ago.  The increase largely reflects the consolidation of securitized cardmember loans and related debt onto the balance sheet in the first quarter. Revenues also reflect higher cardmember spending and higher travel commissions and fees, partially offset by lower interest income due to a smaller loan portfolio, and lower yields on the portfolio.
4
Consolidated provisions for losses totaled $239 million compared to $748 million in the year-ago period, reflecting continued improvement in credit quality.
4
Consolidated expenses totaled $5.6 billion, up 17 percent from $4.8 billion a year ago, reflecting the decision to invest significantly in business building initiatives, as well as higher volume-related rewards costs and the previously discussed restructuring charges.
 
The company's return on average equity (ROE) was 27.5 percent, up from 14.6 percent a year ago.
 
Continued investments in the business helped to generate higher consumer, small business and corporate card spending while expanding the use of our products online, said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive officer.  With cardmember spending up 15 percent this period, we reached all-time records for the quarter and the full year.
 
Credit indicators strengthened and the amount we needed to set aside for problem loans declined significantly from a year ago. Unemployment levels and housing remain a concern, but other aspects of the economy continue to show signs of improvement.
 
Against this backdrop, strong billings and credit quality gives us the flexibility to continue with substantial investments in marketing and infrastructure to build revenues and operate more efficiently in a marketplace being transformed by digital technologies.
 
While we continue to retain the flexibility to scale back our investments as business conditions change, the progress we made during 2010 has put us in a strong competitive position for the next phase of the economic recovery."

Selected Statistical Information
 
 
 
(Billions, except percentages and where indicated)
 
(A)  Card billed business includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements (non-proprietary billed business), and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards.  In-store spend activity within retail co-brand portfolios in Global Network Services, from which the Company earns no revenue, is not included in non-proprietary billed business.  Card billed business is reflected in the United States or outside the United States based on where the cardmember is domiciled.
(B) Total cards-in-force represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding.  Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner and does not include additional supplemental cards issued on that account.  Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force include basic and supplemental cards issued to employee cardmembers.  Non-proprietary cards-in-force includes all cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for retail co-brand cardmember accounts which have no out-of-store spend activity during the prior 12 month period.
(C)  This calculation is designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general purpose American Express cards.  It represents the percentage of billed business (both proprietary and Global Network Services) retained by the Company from merchants it acquires, prior to payments to third parties unrelated to merchant acceptance.
(D)  Average basic cardmember spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only.  Average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs, plus card fees included in interest and fees on loans (including related amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs), divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force.  The card fees related to cardmember loans included in interest and fees on loans were $63 million and $54 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $220 million and $186 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The adjusted average fee per card is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs (a portion of which is charge card related and included in net card fees and a portion of which is lending related and included in interest and fees on loans).  The amount of amortization excluded was $51 million and $54 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $207 million and $243 million for the
years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  The Company presents adjusted average fee per card because management believes that this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products.

(A)  Represents loss provisions for cardmember receivables consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee reserve components. Adjustments to cardmember receivables resulting from unauthorized transactions have been reclassified from this line to "Other" for all periods presented.
(B) For periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, the Companys cardmember loans and related debt performance information on a GAAP basis was referred to as the "owned" basis presentation.  The information presented on a GAAP basis for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 includes only non-securitized cardmember loans that were included in the Companys balance sheet. Effective January 1, 2010, the Companys securitized portfolio of cardmember loans and related debt is also consolidated on its balance sheet upon the adoption of GAAP governing the accounting for transfers of financial assets and consolidation of variable interest entities (the new GAAP). Accordingly, beginning January 1, 2010, the GAAP basis presentation includes both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Refer to page 18 for a discussion of  GAAP basis information.
 
(C)  See Appendix III for calculations of net interest yield on cardmember loans, a non-GAAP measure and net interest income divided by average loans, a GAAP measure. Management believes net interest yield on cardmember loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of the Companys cardmember loans portfolio.
(D)  This calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the cardmember loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on cardmember loans. The calculation includes interest income and interest expense attributable to investment securities and other interest-bearing deposits as well as to cardmember loans, and interest expense attributable to other activities, including cardmember receivables.
(E)  For periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, information presented is based on the Companys historical non-GAAP, or managed basis presentation. Unlike the GAAP basis presentation, the information presented on a managed basis in such periods includes both the securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans.  The adoption of new GAAP on January 1, 2010  resulted in accounting for both the Company's securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans in the consolidated financial statements.  As a result, the Company's 2010 GAAP presentations and managed basis presentations prior to 2010 are generally comparable. Refer to page 18 for a discussion of managed basis information.

(A)  Represents loss provisions for cardmember receivables consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee reserve components. Adjustments to cardmember receivables resulting from unauthorized transactions have been reclassified from this line
to "Other" for all periods presented.
(B)  Effective January 1, 2010, the Company revised the time period in which past due cardmember receivables in International Card Services and Global Commercial Services are written off to when they are 180 days past due or earlier, consistent with applicable bank regulatory guidance and the write-off methodology adopted for U.S. Card Services in the fourth quarter of 2008. Previously, receivables were written off when they were 360 days past billing or earlier. Therefore, the net write-offs for the first quarter of 2010 include net write-offs of approximately $60 million for International Card Services and approximately $48 million for Global Commercial Services resulting from this write-off methodology change, which increased the net loss ratios and decreased the 90 days past billing metrics for these segments, but did not have a substantial impact on provisions for losses. If these amounts had been excluded from net write-offs, the combined net loss ratio for International Card Services/Global Commercial Services for the first quarter of 2010 would have been 0.13%.
(C)  Beginning with the first quarter of 2010, the Company has revised the net loss ratio to exclude net write-offs related to unauthorized transactions, consistent with the methodology for calculation of the net write-off rate for U.S. Card Services. The metrics for prior periods have not been revised for this change as it was deemed immaterial.
(D) For periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, the Company's cardmember loans and related debt performance information on a GAAP basis was referred to as the "owned" basis presentation. The information presented on a GAAP basis for such periods includes only non-securitized cardmember loans that were included in the Companys balance sheet. Effective January 1, 2010, the Companys securitized portfolio of cardmember loans and related debt is also consolidated on its balance sheet upon the adoption of the new GAAP. Accordingly, beginning January 1, 2010, the GAAP basis presentation includes both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Refer to page 18 for a discussion of  GAAP basis information.
(E)  Reflects the new GAAP effective January 1, 2010, which resulted in the consolidation of the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust), reflecting $29.0 billion of additional cardmember loans along with a $2.5 billion loan loss reserve on the Company's balance sheets.
 
(F)  See Appendix III for calculations of net interest yield on cardmember loans, a non-GAAP measure and net interest income divided by average loans, a GAAP measure. Management believes net interest yield on cardmember loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of the Companys cardmember loans portfolio.
(G)  This calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the cardmember loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on cardmember loans.

(A) In accordance with the new GAAP effective January 1, 2010, the Company no longer reports securitization income, net in its income statement.
(B) Includes provisions for losses for off-balance sheet cardmember loans based on the same methodology as applied to on-balance sheet cardmember loans, except that any quarterly adjustment to reserve levels for on-balance sheet loans to address external environmental factors was not applied to adjust the provision expense for the securitized portfolio.
Cardmember Loan Portfolio Presentation
For periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, the Companys non-securitized cardmember loans and related debt performance information on a GAAP basis was referred to as the owned basis presentation. For such periods, the Company also provided information on a non-GAAP managed basis. Unlike the GAAP basis presentation, the managed basis presentation in such periods assumed there had been no off-balance sheet securitizations for the Companys U.S. Card Services segment (the Company does not currently securitize its international cardmember loans), resulting in the inclusion of all securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans and related debt in the Companys performance information.
Under the GAAP basis presentation prior to securitization for periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, revenues and expenses from cardmember loans and related debt were reflected in the Companys income statements in other commissions and fees, net interest income and provisions for losses for cardmember loans. At the time of a securitization transaction, the securitized cardmember loans were removed from the Companys balance sheet, and the resulting gain on sale was reflected in securitization income, net, as well as a reduction to provisions for losses (credit reserves were no longer recorded for the cardmember loans once sold). Over the life of a securitization transaction, the Company recognized the net cash flow from interest and fee collections on interests sold to investors (the investors interests) after deducting interest paid on the investors certificates, credit losses, contractual service fees, other expenses and changes in the fair value of the interest-only strip (referred to as excess spread).  These amounts, in addition to servicing fees and the non-credit components of the gains/(losses) from securitization activities were reflected in securitization income, net. The Company also recognized interest income over the life of the securitization transaction related to the interest it retained (i.e., the sellers interest).
At the maturity of a securitization transaction, cardmember loans on the balance sheet increased, and the impact of the incremental required loss reserves was recorded in provisions for losses.
Under the managed basis presentation for periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, revenues and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans and related debt were reflected in other commissions and fees (included in discount revenue, net card fees and other), interest income, interest expense and provisions for losses. In addition, there was no securitization income, net as this presentation assumed no securitization transactions had occurred.
Historically, the Company included U.S. Card Services information on a managed basis, as that was the manner in which the Companys management viewed and managed the business. Management believed that a full picture of trends in the Companys cardmember loans business could only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans, as the presentation of the entire cardmember loan portfolio was more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and related trends over time. The managed basis presentation also provided investors a more comprehensive assessment of the information necessary for the Company and investors to evaluate the Companys market share.
The adoption of new GAAP on January 1, 2010 resulted in accounting for both the Company's securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans in the consolidated financial statements.  As a result, the Company's 2010 GAAP presentations and managed basis presentations prior to 2010 are generally comparable.

(C) Effective January 1, 2010, the Company revised the time period in which past due cardmember receivables in International Card Services are written off to when they are 180 days past due or earlier, consistent with applicable bank regulatory guidance and the write-off methodology adopted for U.S. Card Services in the fourth quarter of 2008. Previously, receivables were written off when they were 360 days past billing or earlier. Therefore, the net write-offs for the first quarter of 2010 include net write-offs of approximately $60 million for International Card Services resulting from this write-off methodology change, which increased the net loss ratio and decreased the 90 days past billing metric for this segment, but did not have a substantial impact on provisions for losses.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
Beginning Q110, the Company changed the manner in which it allocates capital and related interest expense to its reportable operating segments.  The changes reflect modifications in allocation methodology that the Company believes more accurately reflect the funding and capital characteristics of its segments.  The change to interest allocation also impacted the consolidated and segment reported net interest yield on cardmember loans  The segment results and net interest yield on cardmember loans for quarters prior to Q110 have been restated for this change.

CAPITAL
On July 29, 2009, the Company repurchased the warrants issued under the CPP Program for $340MM, which provided the Treasury with an annualized return on the Companys CPP participation of 26%.  The warrant repurchase resulted in a reduction of cash and corresponding adjustment to Retained Earnings and Additional Paid-In Capital on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet.  There was no impact to the Companys net income or EPS.
Since the inception of repurchase programs in December 1994, 684MM shares have been acquired under cumulative Board authorizations to repurchase up to 770MM shares.  On a cumulative basis, since 1994 the Company has distributed 64% of capital generated through share repurchases and dividends.
On January 7, 2011 the Company submitted its Comprehensive Capital Plan (CCP) to the Federal Reserve requesting approval to proceed with additional share repurchases in 2011.  The CCP includes an analysis of performance and capital availability under certain adverse economic assumptions.  The Company expects a response from the Federal Reserve by the end of the first quarter.  No additional shares are expected to be repurchased prior to their response.

On December 16, 2010 the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued the Basel III rules text, which presents details of global regulatory standards on bank capital adequacy and liquidity agreed to by the Governors and Heads of Supervision, and endorsed by the G20 Leaders at their November, 2010 summit.  While final implementation of the rules related to capital ratios will be determined by the Federal Reserve, the Company estimates that had the new rules been in place during Q410, the reported tier 1 common and tier 1 capital ratios would decline by approximately 50 basis points.
FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY
The total portfolio of U.S. retail Certificate of Deposits (CDs), issued through the direct deposit andthird party programs, had an average remaining maturity of 19.2 months, and an average rate at issuance of 2.5%.  The U.S. retail CDs issued during the fourth quarter of 2010 had a weighted average maturity at issuance of 20.1 months with an average rate at issuance of 1.5%.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company continued to focus its deposit strategy on direct deposits gathered through Personal Savings from American Express, in particular the High Yield Savings Account, rather than CDs distributed through third-party distribution channels.

The Company offers deposits within its American Express Centurion Bank and American Express Bank, FSB (FSB) subsidiaries (together, the Banks).  These funds are insured up to $250,000 per account through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  During Q209, the Company, through FSB, launched a direct deposit-taking program, Personal Savingsfrom American Express, to supplement its distribution of deposit products through third-party distribution channels.  This program makes FDIC-insured CDs and high-yield savings account products available directly to consumers.
 
The Company currently has an objective to hold excess cash and readily marketable securities to satisfy all maturing long-term funding obligations for a 12-month period, in addition to having access to significant additional contingent liquidity sources in the event that access to its primary funding sources should become unavailable.  As of December 31, 2010, the Company held $20B of excess cash and readily marketable securities versus $20B of long-term debt and CDs maturing over the next 12 months.

Under the terms of the settlement agreements, the Company will receive aggregate maximum payments of up to $2.25B from Visa and $1.8B from MasterCard.  The settlement with Visa is comprised of an initial payment of $1.13B ($700MM after-tax) that was recorded in Q407 and received in March 2008, and quarterly payments of up to $70MM ($43MM after-tax) for four years from Q108 through Q411. The settlement with MasterCard is comprised of quarterly payments of up to $150MM ($93MM after-tax) for three years from Q308 through Q211.  The Company recognized $70MM from Visa for each of the past twelve quarters and $150MM from MasterCard for each of the past ten quarters pursuant to these agreements.
The installment payments from both parties are subject to the Company achieving certain quarterly performance criteria in the GNS business within the U.S., which the Company believes it is positioned to meet.  Payments earned through December 2010 have been recorded as a reduction to the other, net expense line within the Corporate & Other segment.
The $113MM of net reengineering costs consists primarily of $114MM of net severance-related costs, partially offset by revisions of certain estimates impacting real estate-related reserve balances tied to the Companys reengineering initiatives.
In addition, the Company expects to record further restructuring charges in one or more quarterly periods during 2011 relating to the reengineering activities described above in the aggregate amount of approximately $60MM to $80MM pre-tax (approximately $38MM to $51MM after-tax). The total expected additional charges include approximately $25MM to $35MM in costs associated with additional employee compensation and approximately $35MM to $45MM in other costs principally relating to the termination of certain real property leases.
Substantially all of the reengineering activities are expected to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2011.
The Company also announced that it expects the charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 and to be recorded during 2011 to result in annualized cost savings to the Company of approximately $70MM, starting in 2012. The Company announced that it intends to reinvest a portion of such savings into new servicing capabilities and other business building initiatives.

Supplemental Information  Tangible Common Equity and Total Adjusted Assets
During the third quarter of 2006, the Company issued $750MM of 6.80% Subordinated Debentures due 2036 (Subordinated Debentures), which are automatically extendable until 2066 unless certain events occur prior to that date. In connection with the Subordinated Debentures, the Company has undertaken to disclose on a quarterly basis the amount of its tangible common equity and total adjusted assets, as defined in the Subordinated Debentures.  The Companys consolidated tangible common equity amount as of the end of any fiscal quarter means the total shareholders equity, excluding preferred stock, of the Company as reflected on its consolidated balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP as of such fiscal quarter end minus (i) intangible assets and goodwill and (ii) deferred acquisition costs, as determined in accordance with GAAP and reflected in such consolidated balance sheet.  The Companys total adjusted assets as of the end of any fiscal quarter is calculated as the sum of (i) total consolidated assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet minus (ii) non-securitized Cardmember loan receivables (without deduction for reserves), which are set forth on the Companys balance sheet, plus (iii) managed (i.e., securitized and non-securitized) worldwide Cardmember loan receivables as reported by the Company for such fiscal quarter.  Upon the adoption of new GAAP effective  January 1, 2010, the Companys total consolidated assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet now are the same amount as would be calculated as total adjusted assets as defined in the Subordinated Debentures before the change in GAAP.  As of December 31, 2010, the Companys tangible common equity was $13B and its total adjusted assets as defined in the Subordinated Debentures, were $147B.

Cardmember Loan Portfolio Presentation
For periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, the Companys non-securitized cardmember loans and related debt performance information on a GAAP basis was referred to as the owned basis presentation. For such periods, the Company also provided information on a non-GAAP managed basis. Unlike the GAAP basis presentation, the managed basis presentation in such periods assumed there had been no off-balance sheet securitizations for the Companys USCS segment (the Company does not currently securitize its international cardmember loans), resulting in the inclusion of all securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans and related debt in the Companys performance information.
Under the GAAP basis presentation prior to a securitization for periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, revenues and expenses from cardmember loans and related debt were reflected in the Companys income statements in other commissions and fees, net interest income and provisions for losses for cardmember loans. At the time of a securitization transaction, the securitized cardmember loans were removed from the Companys balance sheet, and the resulting gain on sale was reflected in securitization income, net, as well as a reduction to provisions for losses (credit reserves were no longer recorded for the cardmember loans once sold). Over the life of a securitization transaction, the Company recognized the net cash flow from interest and fee collections on interests sold to investors (the investors interests) after deducting interest paid on the investors certificates, credit losses, contractual service fees, other expenses and changes in the fair value of the interest-only strip (referred to as excess spread). These amounts, in addition to servicing fees and the non-credit components of the gains/(losses) from securitization activities, were reflected in securitization income, net. The Company also recognized interest income over the life of the securitization transaction related to the interest it retained (i.e., the sellers interest). At the maturity of a securitization transaction, cardmember loans on the balance sheet increased, and the impact of the incremental required loss reserves was recorded in provisions for losses.
Under the managed basis presentation for periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, revenues and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans and related debt were reflected in other commissions and fees (included in discount revenue, net card fees and other), interest income, interest expense and provisions for losses. In addition, there was no securitization income, net as this presentation assumed no securitization transactions had occurred.
Historically, the Company included USCS information on a managed basis, as that was the manner in which the Companys management viewed and managed the business. Management believed that a full picture of trends in the Companys cardmember loans business could only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans, as the presentation of the entire cardmember loan portfolio was more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and related trends over time. The managed basis presentation also provided investors a more comprehensive assessment of the information necessary for the Company and investors to evaluate the Companys market share.
The adoption of new GAAP on January 1, 2010 resulted in accounting for both the Companys securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans in the consolidated financial statements.  As a result, the Companys 2010 GAAP presentations and managed basis presentations prior to 2010 are generally comparable.
For additional information on the differences between the Companys historical GAAP and managed basis presentations, see the Companys 2009 Financial Review included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.
