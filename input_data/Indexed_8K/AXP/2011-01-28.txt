At its meetings held on January 23 and 24, 2011, the Compensation and Benefits Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors of American Express Company (the Company) made various decisions regarding the compensation to be awarded to the Companys chairman and chief executive officer, Kenneth I. Chenault, for the year ended December 31, 2010.  Reflecting the goal of further tying executive compensation more closely to long-term Company performance, the Committee decided to pay the significant majority of Mr. Chenaults annual incentive compensation and portfolio grant payouts in the form of equity-based Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), rather than making such payments primarily in cash as had historically been done.  Such RSUs will vest in January 2012.  One-half of the common shares to be delivered to Mr. Chenault upon vesting of the RSUs (net of shares withheld for payment of taxes) will be required to be retained by him until one year after his retirement from the Company.  As part of his ongoing financial planning and in light of the change in compensation mix, Mr. Chenault sold 170,000 shares of the Companys common stock on January 27, 2011, at various prices ranging from $44.36 to $44.75 per share.  The shares that were sold represented approximately 15.6% of Mr. Chenaults share holdings in the Company as of the sale date.  Mr. Chenault continues to own 917,624 shares of the Companys common stock.  In addition, Mr. Chenault will acquire 122,124 shares of the Companys common stock (before the deduction of shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations) upon the vesting of RSUs on January 31, 2011.
