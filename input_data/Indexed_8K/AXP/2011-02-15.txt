American Express Company Financial Community Meeting
Kenneth Chenault
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Doug Buckminster
President, International Consumer Card and Small Business Services
February 9, 2011
This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial disclosures, including information regarding the Company's "International Business Operations" and information that is reported on a "managed" basis.   International Business Operations (IBO) includes the Company's International Card Services (ICS) segment as well as the international portions of the Global Commercial Services (GCS) and the Global Network & Merchant Services (GNMS) segments.  Reconciliations of this information to GAAP information is included in the annexes.  The Company is presenting information on an IBO basis because management believes it presents a useful perspective on the performance of the Company's international businesses.  International represents the sum of the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region, the Japan, Asia/Pacific and Australia (JAPA) region and the Latin America, Caribbean and Canada (LACC) region to be set forth in the geographic operations footnote to the Company's 2010 consolidated financial statements.  Due to system limitations related to geographic reporting prior to 2008, the Company is unable to identify the specific nature of the reconciling items related to amounts previously reported in the Company's financial statements and the IBO basis presentation.  Managed basis assumes no securitization transactions, i.e., all securitized loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the Company's balance sheet and income statement, respectively.  The Company is presenting information on a managed basis because that is the way management views and manages the business.  Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company's cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans, and that use of a managed basis presentation presents a more comprehensive portrayal of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business.  These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the Company's GAAP information.

Note Relating to Non-GAAP Financial Disclosures
This presentation includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to risks and uncertainties.  The forward-looking statements, which address the company's expected business and financial performance, among other matters, contain words such as "believe," "expect," "estimate," "anticipate," "optimistic," "intend," "plan," "aim," "will," "may," "should," "could," "would," "likely," and similar expressions.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made.  The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the following:
changes in global economic and business conditions, including consumer and business spending, the availability and cost of credit, unemployment and political conditions, all of which may significantly affect spending on the Card, delinquency rates, loan balances and other aspects of our business and results of operations;
changes in capital and credit market conditions, which may significantly affect the Company's ability to meet its liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital, including  changes in interest rates; changes in market conditions affecting the valuation of our assets; or any reduction in our credit ratings or those of our subsidiaries, which could materially increase the cost and other terms of our funding, restrict our access to the capital markets or result in contingent payments under contracts;
litigation, such as class actions or proceedings brought by governmental and regulatory agencies (including the lawsuit filed against the Company by the U.S. Department of Justice and certain state attorneys general), that could result in (i) the imposition of behavioral remedies against the Company or the Company's voluntarily making certain changes to its business practices, the effects of which in either case could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial performance;  (ii) the imposition of substantial monetary damages in private actions against the Company; and/or (iii) damage to the Company's global reputation and brand;
the Company's net interest yield on U.S. cardmember loans not trending over time to historical levels as expected, which will be influenced by, among other things, the effects of the CARD Act (including the regulations requiring the Company to periodically reevaluate APR increases), interest rates, changes in consumer behavior that affect loan balances, such as paydown rates, the Company's cardmember acquisition strategy, product mix, credit actions, including line size and other adjustments to credit availability, and pricing changes;
legal and regulatory developments wherever we do business, including legislative and regulatory reforms in the United States, such as the Dodd-Frank Act's stricter regulation of large, interconnected financial institutions, changes in requirements relating to securitization and the establishment of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, which could make fundamental changes to many of our business practices or materially affect our capital requirements, results of operations, ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock; or actions and potential future actions by the FDIC and credit rating agencies applicable to securitization trusts, which could impact the company's ABS program;
changes in the substantial and increasing worldwide competition in the payments industry, including competitive pressure that may impact the prices we charge merchants that accept our Cards and the success of marketing, promotion or rewards programs;
changes in technology or in our ability to protect our intellectual property (such as copyrights, trademarks, patents and controls on access and distribution), and invest in and  compete at the leading edge of technological developments across our businesses, including technology and intellectual property of third parties whom we rely on, all of which could materially affect our results of operations;
3
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward- Looking Statements
data breaches and fraudulent activity, which could damage our brand, increase our costs or have regulatory implications, and changes in regulation affecting privacy and data security under federal, state and foreign law, which could result in higher compliance and technology costs to ourselves or our vendors;
changes in our ability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the management and operation of the company's business, including any changes that may result from increasing regulatory supervision of compensation practices;
changes in the financial condition and creditworthiness of our business partners, such as bankruptcies, restructurings or consolidations, involving merchants that represent a significant portion of our business, such as the airline industry, or our partners in Global Network Services or financial institutions that we rely on for routine funding and liquidity, which could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations;
uncertainties associated with business acquisitions, including the ability to realize anticipated business retention, growth and cost savings or effectively integrate the acquired business into our existing operations;
the underlying assumptions related to the Company's pending acquisition of Loyalty Partner proving to be inaccurate; unrealized events impacting the likelihood and timing of the completion of the transaction; the Company's ability to exploit the assets to be acquired upon consummation of the transaction; and the Company's ability to execute its acquisition strategy including expanding to other countries, cross-selling and developing new products;
changes affecting the success of our reengineering and other cost control initiatives, which may result in  the company not realizing all or a significant portion of the benefits that we intend;
the actual amount to be spent by the Company on investments in the business, including on marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services and certain other operating expenses, which will be based in part on management's assessment of competitive opportunities and the Company's performance and the ability to control and manage operating, infrastructure, advertising and promotion expenses as business expands or changes;
the effectiveness of the Company's risk management policies and procedures, including credit risk relating to consumer debt, liquidity risk in meeting business requirements and operational risks;
changes affecting our ability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints, such as changes in interest rates and regulatory restrictions on our ability to obtain deposit funding or offer competitive interest rates, which could affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business; and
factors beyond our control such as fire, power loss, disruptions in telecommunications, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorism, "hackers" or fraud, which could affect travel-related spending or disrupt our global network systems and ability to process transactions.
A further description of these uncertainties and other risks can be found in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2010, and the Company's other reports filed with the SEC.

Annex 4
(A)
($ in millions, except percentages)
(A) Beginning in the first quarter of 2010, the Company changed the manner in which it allocates related interest expense and capital to its reportable operating segments to more accurately reflect the funding and capital characteristics of the Company's segments. The change to interest allocation impacted the segment's net interest yield on cardmember loans.  Accordingly, the net interest yields for periods prior to the first quarter of 2010 have been revised for this change. (B) For periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, the Company's cardmember loans and related debt performance information on a GAAP basis was referred to as the "owned" basis presentation. The information presented on a GAAP basis for such periods includes only non-securitized cardmember loans that were included in the Company's balance sheet. Effective January 1, 2010, the Company's securitized portfolio of cardmember loans and related debt is also consolidated on its balance sheet upon the adoption of the new GAAP. Accordingly, beginning January 1, 2010, the GAAP basis presentation includes both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Refer to page 19 of the earnings financial tables for a discussion of  GAAP basis information. (C) Represents net interest income allocated to the Company's cardmember loans portfolio on a GAAP or managed basis, as applicable, in each case excluding the impact of card fees on loans and balance transfer fees attributable to the Company's cardmember loans. (D) Represents average cardmember loans on a GAAP or managed basis, as applicable, in each case excluding the impact of deferred card fees, net of deferred direct acquisition costs of cardmember loans. (E)  This calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the cardmember loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on cardmember loans. The calculation includes interest income and interest expense attributable to investment securities and other interest-bearing deposits as well as to cardmember loans,and interest expense attributable to other activities, including cardmember receivables. (F) Net interest yield on cardmember loans is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents the net spread earned on cardmember loans.  Net interest yield on cardmember loans is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by adjusted average loans, computed on an annualized basis.  The calculation of net interest yield on cardmember loans includes interest that is deemed uncollectible. For all presentations of net interest yield on cardmember loans, reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses - cardmember loans; therefore, such reserves and net write-offs are not included in the net interest yield calculation. (G)  For periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, information presented is based on the Company's historical non-GAAP, or "managed" basis presentation. Unlike the GAAP basis presentation, the information presented on a managed basis in such periods includes both the securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. The adoption of new GAAP on January 1, 2010 resulted in accounting for both the Company's securitized and non- securitized cardmember loans in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, the Company's 2010 GAAP presentations and managed basis presentations prior to 2010 are generally comparable. Refer to page 19 in the earnings financial tables for a discussion of managed basis information.(H) For periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, the information presented includes the adjustments to the GAAP "owned" basis presentation for such periods attributable to securitization activity for interest income and interest expense to arrive at the non-GAAP "managed" basis information, which adjustments are set forth under the U.S. Card Services managed basis presentation on page 22 of the earnings financial tables.

Average Fee Per Card on Consolidated Basis  GAAP & Adjusted *
2010
Average Fee Per Card (GAAP)
$38
Average Fee Per Card (Adjusted)
$41
*
Average fee per card is computed from proprietary card activities only.  Average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs, plus card fees included in interest and fees on loans (including related amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs), divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force. The card fees related to cardmember loans included in interest and fees on loans were $220 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 on a consolidated basis.  The adjusted average fee per card is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs (a portion of which is charge card related and included in net card fees and a portion of which is lending related and included in interest and fees on loans). The amount of amortization excluded was $207 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 on a consolidated basis.  The Company presents adjusted average fee per card because management believes that this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products.

*Average fee per card is computed from proprietary card activities only.  Average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs, plus card fees included in interest and fees on loans (including related amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs), divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force. On a consolidated basis, the average fee per card and average fee per card (adjusted) for 2010 was $38 and $41, respectively. The card fees related to cardmember loans included in interest and fees on loans were  $220 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 on a consolidated basis. The adjusted average fee per card is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs (a portion of which is charge card related and included in net card fees and a portion of which is lending related and included in interest and fees on loans).  The amount of amortization excluded was $207 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 on a consolidated basis.  The Company presents adjusted average fee per card because management believes that this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products.  See the Supplemental Annex for GAAP basis.
