On January 7, 2011, American Express Company (the Company) submitted its Comprehensive Capital Plan (CCP) to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the Federal Reserve).  The CCP included an analysis of performance and capital availability under certain adverse economic assumptions, as well as a capital distribution plan outlining the Companys plans to return capital to shareholders in 2011 through dividends and share repurchases.  On March 18, 2011, the Company was informed that the Federal Reserve had no objections to the Companys 2011 capital distribution plan.   The number of shares that will be repurchased in 2011 will be based on the Companys business plans and financial performance, and will be consistent with its submitted capital distribution plan.
 
As the Company has previously disclosed, its objective is to return to shareholders, on average and over time, approximately 50% of the capital it generates, through a combination of dividends and the repurchase of the Companys common shares.  The Company does not expect to commence share repurchase activities until after it lifts its standard earnings release-related trading blackout, which is currently in effect until after financial results for the quarter ending March 31, 2011, have been announced.
