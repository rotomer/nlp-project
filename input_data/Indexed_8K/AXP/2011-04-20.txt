New York  April 20, 2011 -today reported first-quarter net income of $1.2 billion, up 33 percent from $885 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share was $0.97, up 33 percent from $0.73 a year ago.
American Express Company (NYSE: AXP)
Consolidated total revenues net of interest expense were $7.0 billion, up 7 percent from $6.6 billion a year ago. The increase largely reflects higher cardmember spending and higher travel commissions and fees, partially offset by lower interest income due to a lower yield on the loan portfolio.
Consolidated provisions for losses totaled $97 million compared to $943 million in the year-ago period reflecting continued improvement in credit quality.
Consolidated expenses totaled $5.2 billion, up 19 percent from $4.4 billion a year ago. The increase reflected significant investments in business building initiatives, as well as higher rewards costs.
The company's return on average equity (ROE) was 27.9 percent, up from 18.0 percent a year ago.
_____________________________
 
 
 
Record earnings this quarter reflect credit quality and billed business trends that are among the best weve seen, said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive officer, American Express. Cardmember spending was up 17 percent, with broad-based strength across all our businesses segments. After several years of decline, our lending portfolio leveled off and total revenues grew at the healthiest pace since before the recession.
Continued improvement in credit quality strengthened our bottom line results and provided additional resources to enhance premium products, expand reward offerings and build technology that supports our best-in-class customer service.
Our stepped up investment spending has helped us capitalize on opportunities during the early stages of the economic recovery and strengthen relationships with consumer, small business and corporate customers. By moving aggressively, we have also been able to expand our leadership role in online commerce, introduce the next generation of digital payments and deepen our relationships with merchants internationally.
A good deal of our investment spending has been funded with the benefits of rapidly improving credit quality and payments from the settlement of litigation with MasterCard and Visa. Now, with credit losses at historical lows and settlement payments ending in the second and fourth quarter, we are moving forward with plans to slow the growth of our operating expenses towards the end of this year and into next.
While the economic and regulatory environment remains uncertain, we are generating strong momentum across our businesses and are well positioned to deliver strong results for our shareholders.

(A)  Card billed business includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements (non-proprietary billed business), and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards.  In-store spend activity within retail co-brand portfolios in Global Network Services, from which the Company earns no revenue, is not included in non-proprietary billed business.  Card billed business is reflected in the United States or outside the United States based on where the cardmember is domiciled.
(B) Total cards-in-force represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding.  Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner and does not include additional supplemental cards issued on that account.  Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force include basic and supplemental cards issued to employee cardmembers.  Non-proprietary cards-in-force includes all cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for retail co-brand cardmember accounts which have no out-of-store spend activity during the prior 12 month period.
(C)  Prior to and including the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company did not have the data necessary to separately report Basic and Supplementary cards-in-force (CIF) for Global Network Services; therefore, all cards-in-force for Global Network Services was reported as Basic CIF. Starting in the first quarter of 2011, as the necessary data became available, the Company began to separately report Basic and Supplementary CIF for Global Network Services.  The Company has accordingly revised prior periods to conform with the current period presentation.
(D)  This calculation is designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general purpose American Express cards.  It represents the percentage of billed business (both proprietary and Global Network Services) retained by the Company from merchants it acquires, prior to payments to third parties unrelated to merchant acceptance.
(E)  Average basic cardmember spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only.  Average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs, plus card fees included in interest and fees on loans (including related amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs), divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force.  The card fees related to cardmember loans included in interest and fees on loans were $64 million and $51 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  The adjusted average fee per card is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs (a portion of which is charge card related and included in net card fees and a portion of which is lending related and included in interest and fees on loans).  The amount of amortization excluded was $54 million and $51 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  The Company presents adjusted average fee per card because management believes that this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products.

# - Denotes a variance of more than 100%.
(A)  Represents loss provisions for cardmember receivables consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee reserve components.
(B)  Effective January 1, 2010, the Company revised the time period in which past due cardmember receivables in International Card Services and Global Commercial Services are written off to when they are 180 days past due or earlier, consistent with applicable bank regulatory guidance and the write-off methodology adopted for U.S. Card Services in the fourth quarter of 2008. Previously, receivables were written off when they were 360 days past billing or earlier. Therefore, the net write-offs for the first quarter of 2010 include net write-offs of approximately $60 million for International Card Services and approximately $48 million for Global Commercial Services resulting from this write-off methodology change, which increased the net loss ratios and decreased the 90 days past billing metrics for these segments, but did not have a substantial impact on provisions for losses. If these amounts had been excluded from net write-offs, the combined net loss ratio for International Card Services/Global Commercial Services for the first quarter of 2010 would have been 0.13%.
(C)  In accordance with GAAP effective January 1, 2010, which resulted in the consolidation of the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust), reflecting $29.0 billion of additional cardmember loans along with a $2.5 billion loan loss reserve on the Company's balance sheets.
(D)  See Appendix III for calculations of net interest yield on cardmember loans, a non-GAAP measure and net interest income divided by average loans, a GAAP measure.  Management believes net interest yield on cardmember loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of the Companys cardmember loan portfolio.
(E)  This calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the cardmember loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on cardmember loans. The calculation includes interest income and interest expense attributable to investment securities and other interest-bearing deposits as well as to cardmember loans, and interest expense attributable to other activities, including cardmember receivables.

(C) Effective January 1, 2010, the Company revised the time period in which past due cardmember receivables in Global Commercial Services are written off to when they are 180 days past due or earlier, consistent with applicable bank regulatory guidance and the write-off methodology adopted for U.S. Card Services in the fourth quarter of 2008. Previously, receivables were written off when they were 360 days past billing or earlier. Therefore, the net write-offs for the first quarter of 2010 include net write-offs of approximately $48 million for Global Commercial Services resulting from this write-off methodology change, which increased the net loss ratio and decreased the 90 days past billing metric for this segment, but did not have a substantial impact on provisions for losses. If this amount had been excluded from net write-offs, the net loss ratio for Global Commercial Services would have been 0.11%.

(B)  Represents average cardmember loans excluding the impact of deferred card fees, net of deferred direct acquisition costs of cardmember loans.
(C)  This calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the cardmember loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on cardmember loans. The calculation includes interest income and interest expense attributable to investment securities and other interest-bearing deposits as well as to cardmember loans, and interest expense attributable to other activities, including cardmember receivables.
(D)  Net interest yield on cardmember loans is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by adjusted average loans, computed on an annualized basis.  The calculation of net interest yield on cardmember loans includes interest that is deemed uncollectible. For all presentations of net interest yield on cardmember loans, reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses - cardmember loans; therefore, such reserves and net write-offs are not included in the net interest yield calculation.

Beginning Q410, the Company completed its conversion to a new general ledger platform. This conversion enabled the Company to streamline its ledger reporting unit structure, resulting in a reconfiguration of intercompany accounts. These changes have the effect of altering intercompany balances among segments, thus altering reported total segment assets. Total segment assets presented in the First Quarter 2011 Earnings Release reflect the changes described above. This conversion had no impact on segment results, segment capital or return on segment capital metrics.

CAPITAL
Since the inception of repurchase programs in December 1994, 684MM shares have been acquired under cumulative Board authorizations to repurchase up to 770MM shares. On a cumulative basis, since 1994 the Company has distributed 63% of capital generated through share repurchases and dividends.
On January 7, 2011, the Company submitted its Comprehensive Capital Plan (CCP) to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the Federal Reserve). The CCP included an analysis of performance and capital availability under certain adverse economic assumptions, as well as a capital distribution plan outlining the Companys plans to return capital to shareholders in 2011 through dividends and share repurchases. On March 18, 2011, the Company was informed that the Federal Reserve had no objections to the Companys 2011 capital distribution plan. The number of shares that will be repurchased in 2011 will be based on the Companys business plans and financial performance, and will be consistent with its submitted capital distribution plan.
As the Company has previously disclosed, its objective is to return to shareholders, on average and over time, approximately 50% of the capital it generates through a combination of dividends and the repurchase of common shares. The Company expects to commence share repurchase activities during Q211.
On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued the Basel III rules text, which presents details of global regulatory standards on bank capital adequacy and liquidity agreed to by the Governors and Heads of Supervision, and endorsed by the G20 Leaders at their November, 2010 summit. While final implementation of the rules related to capital ratios will be determined by the Federal Reserve, the Company estimates that had the new rules been in place during Q111, the reported tier 1 common and tier 1 capital ratios would decline by approximately 80 basis points. In addition, the impact of the new rules on the reported Tier 1 leverage ratio would be a decline of approximately 170 basis points.

FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY
The total portfolio of U.S. retail Certificates of Deposit (CDs) issued through the direct deposit and third party programs had an average remaining maturity of 19.5 months and an average rate at issuance of 2.6%.
 
The Company offers deposits within its American Express Centurion Bank and American Express Bank, FSB (FSB) subsidiaries (together, the Banks). These funds are insured up to $250,000 per account through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The Company, through FSB, has a direct deposit-taking program, Personal Savings from American Express, to supplement its distribution of deposit products through third-party distribution channels. This program makes FDIC-insured CDs and high-yield savings account products available directly to consumers.
The Company currently has an objective to hold excess cash and readily marketable securities to satisfy all maturing long-term funding obligations for a 12-month period, in addition to having access to significant additional contingent liquidity sources in the event that access to its primary funding sources should become unavailable. As of March 31, 2011, the Company held $20B of excess cash and readily marketable securities versus $17B of long-term debt and CDs maturing over the next 12 months.

OTHER ITEMS OF NOTE
The installment payments from both parties are subject to the Company achieving certain quarterly performance criteria in the GNS business within the U.S., which the Company believes it is positioned to meet. Payments earned through March 2011 have been recorded as a reduction to the other, net expense line within the Corporate & Other segment.
During 2011, the Company expects to record restructuring charges in one or more quarterly periods relating to the reengineering activities described above in the aggregate amount of approximately $60MM to $80MM pre-tax (approximately $38MM to $51MM after-tax). The total expected additional charges include approximately $25MM to $35MM in costs associated with additional employee compensation and approximately $35MM to $45MM in other costs principally relating to the termination of certain real property leases. In Q111, the Company recorded $11MM ($7MM after-tax) of the $60MM to $80MM in expected additional charges.
Substantially all of the reengineering activities are expected to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2011.
The Company also announced that it expects the charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 and to be recorded during 2011 to result in annualized cost savings to the Company of approximately $70MM, starting in 2012. The Company announced that it intends to reinvest a portion of such savings into new servicing capabilities and other business building initiatives.

Supplemental Information  Tangible Common Equity and Total Adjusted Assets
During the third quarter of 2006, the Company issued $750MM of 6.80% Subordinated Debentures due 2036 (Subordinated Debentures), which are automatically extendable until 2066 unless certain events occur prior to that date. In connection with the Subordinated Debentures, the Company has undertaken to disclose on a quarterly basis the amount of its tangible common equity and total adjusted assets, as defined in the Subordinated Debentures. The Companys consolidated tangible common equity amount as of the end of any fiscal quarter means the total shareholders equity, excluding preferred stock, of the Company as reflected on its consolidated balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP as of such fiscal quarter end minus (i) intangible assets and goodwill and (ii) deferred acquisition costs, as determined in accordance with GAAP and reflected in such consolidated balance sheet. The Companys total adjusted assets as of the end of any fiscal quarter is calculated as the sum of (i) total consolidated assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet minus (ii) non-securitized Cardmember loan receivables (without deduction for reserves), which are set forth on the Companys balance sheet, plus (iii) managed (i.e., securitized and non-securitized) worldwide Cardmember loan receivables as reported by the Company for such fiscal quarter. Upon the adoption of new GAAP effective January 1, 2010, the Companys total consolidated assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet now are the same amount as would be calculated as total adjusted assets as defined in the Subordinated Debentures before the change in GAAP. As of March 31, 2011, the Companys tangible common equity was $13B and its total adjusted assets as defined in the Subordinated Debentures, were $144B. As of March 31, 2011, the consolidated total assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet were also $144B.
