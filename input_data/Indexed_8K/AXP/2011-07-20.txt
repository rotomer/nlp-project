AMERICAN EXPRESS SECOND QUARTER EPS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS UP 27% to $1.07;
REVENUES RISE 12% ON RECORD CARDMEMBER SPENDING
(Millions, except per share amounts)
 
 
-today reported second-quarter income from continuing operations of $1.3 billion, up 27 percent from $1.0 billion a year ago.  Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.07, up 27 percent from $0.84 a year ago.
New York  July 20, 2011
American Express Company (NYSE: AXP)
Net income, which includes discontinued operations, totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter, up 31 percent from a year ago. Per-share, net income was $1.10, up 31 percent from $0.84 a year ago.
Consolidated total revenues net of interest expense were $7.6 billion, up 12 percent from $6.8 billion a year ago.  The increase largely reflects higher cardmember spending and higher travel commissions and fees. While net interest income was lower, the decline was less than in previous quarters because lower net interest yield was partially offset by an increase in the companys loan portfolio.
 
_____________________________
 
 
 
 
 
Consolidated provisions for losses totaled $357 million, down from $652 million in the year-ago period reflecting continued improvement in credit quality.
Consolidated expenses totaled $5.5 billion, up 21 percent from $4.6 billion a year ago. The increase reflects the cumulative impact of rewards program enhancements designed to encourage cardmembers to earn and redeem rewards points, along with significant investments in business building initiatives. The company's return on average equity (ROE) was 28.2 percent, up from 23.5 percent a year ago.
During the second quarter, revenue and expense growth rates were approximately 4 percentage points higher due to the translation effects of a comparatively weaker U.S. dollar.

The effective tax rate was 27 percent, compared to 36 percent in the year-ago quarter.  The decrease in rate is primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain prior years tax items.
Strong revenues and excellent credit performance helped us deliver record earnings this quarter, said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive officer, American Express. Higher revenue growth reflects an attractive return on the investments weve been making to strengthen merchant relationships and enhance cardmember services.
Cardmember spending was at an all-time high, growing 18 percent (15 percent adjusted for foreign exchange conversions) and we saw broad-based strength across the consumer, small business and corporate sectors globally.  While net interest income was down from last year because of a lower yield on our portfolio, cardmember borrowing rose 2 percent, reversing the pattern of the past couple of years.
"The underlying momentum across the company once again gave us the flexibility to make substantial investments in business building initiatives.  Expense levels for the quarter reflected those investments as well as the cost of enhanced rewards programs that strengthen our cardmember relationships and contribute to the overall increase in spending on our network.
While were very pleased with todays results, we believe that new technologies will transform the payments industry over time. With that in mind, we are moving aggressively to extend our position as a leader in online commerce and attract new customers beyond our traditional base.
 
Over the past few months, weve built a location-based marketplace with Foursquare and upgraded our digital payments platform, Serve.  We expanded our relationship with Facebook to deliver coupon-less offers shaped by the unique likes of our cardmembers and their online friends.  And, along the same lines, we created a digital marketing tool that helps merchants build their business with customized offers on Facebook and other fast growing social networks.

As the worlds of online and offline commerce converge, the investments were making in our digital closed loop should create opportunities to build additional business with merchants and provide cardmembers with customized service, access, offers and experiences that have always been a hallmark of American Express.

All information in the following tables is presented on a basis prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), unless otherwise indicated. Prior period amounts were revised in the first quarter of 2011 to reflect various changes associated with the Company's reclassification of certain contractual lump sum payments to partners, previously recognized in Other, net, expenses, as either contra Discount revenue or Marketing and promotion expense. Additionally, the tables reflect changes to the Company's segment allocation methodology due to reorganization of certain businesses, such as Enterprise Growth, across its reportable operating segments.
 
(A) Represents income from continuing operations or net income, as applicable, less earnings allocated to participating share awards and other items of $15 million and $13 million for the three months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, and $30 million and $25 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

(A)  Card billed business includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements (non-proprietary billed business), and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards.  In-store spend activity within retail co-brand portfolios in Global Network Services, from which the Company earns no revenue, is not included in non-proprietary billed business.  Card billed business is reflected in the United States or outside the United States based on where the cardmember is domiciled.
(B) Total cards-in-force represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding.  Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner and does not include additional supplemental cards issued on that account.  Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force include basic and supplemental cards issued to employee cardmembers.  Non-proprietary cards-in-force includes all cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for retail co-brand cardmember accounts which have no out-of-store spend activity during the prior 12 month period.
(C)  Prior to and including the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company did not have the data necessary to separately report Basic and Supplementary cards-in-force (CIF) for Global Network Services; therefore, all cards-in-force for Global Network Services was reported as Basic CIF. Starting in the first quarter of 2011, as the necessary data became available, the Company began to separately report Basic and Supplementary CIF for Global Network Services.  The Company has accordingly revised prior periods to conform with the current period presentation.
(D)  This calculation is designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general purpose American Express cards.  It represents the percentage of billed business (both proprietary and Global Network Services) retained by the Company from merchants it acquires, prior to payments to third parties unrelated to merchant acceptance.
(E)  Average basic cardmember spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only.  Average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs, plus card fees included in interest and fees on loans (including related amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs), divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force.  The card fees related to cardmember loans included in interest and fees on loans were $68 million and $48 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  The adjusted average fee per card, which is a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs (a portion of which is charge card related and included in net card fees and a portion of which is lending related and included in interest and fees on loans).  The amount of amortization excluded was $56 million and $56 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  The Company presents adjusted average fee per card because the Company believes this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products.

(A)  Represents loss provisions for cardmember receivables consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee reserve components.
 
(B)  The Company presents a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention.  In addition, because the Company's practice is to include uncollectible interest and/or fees as part of its total provision for losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented.
 
(C)  See Appendix III for calculations of net interest yield on cardmember loans, a non-GAAP measure, and net interest income divided by average loans, a GAAP measure.  The Company believes net interest yield on cardmember loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of the Companys cardmember loan portfolio.
(D)  This calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the cardmember loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on cardmember loans. The calculation includes interest income and interest expense attributable to investment securities and other interest-bearing deposits as well as to cardmember loans, and interest expense attributable to other activities, including cardmember receivables.

(B) Return on average tangible common equity is computed in the same manner as return on average common equity except the computation of average tangible common shareholders' equity, a non-GAAP measure, excludes from average total shareholders' equity, average goodwill and other intangibles of $3.7 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, $3.5 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2011, $3.3 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2010, $3.2 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 and $3.2 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2010.  The Company believes that return on average tangible common equity is a useful measure of the profitability of its business.

(A) Return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing one year period segment income by one year average segment capital.  Return on average tangible segment capital is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, excludes average goodwill and other intangibles.  The Company believes that return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of its business.

(A)  Represents net interest income allocated to the Company's cardmember loan portfolio excluding the impact of card fees on loans and balance transfer fees attributable to the Company's cardmember loans.
(B)  Represents average cardmember loans excluding the impact of deferred card fees, net of deferred direct acquisition costs of cardmember loans.
(C)  This calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the cardmember loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on cardmember loans. The calculation includes interest income and interest expense attributable to investment securities and other interest-bearing deposits as well as to cardmember loans, and interest expense attributable to other activities, including cardmember receivables.
(D)  Net interest yield on cardmember loans, a non-GAAP measure, is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by adjusted average loans, computed on an annualized basis.  The calculation of net interest yield on cardmember loans includes interest that is deemed uncollectible. For all presentations of net interest yield on cardmember loans, reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses - cardmember loans; therefore, such reserves and net write-offs are not included in the net interest yield calculation.

Beginning Q410, the Company completed its conversion to a new general ledger platform.  This conversion enabled the Company to streamline its ledger reporting unit structure, resulting in a reconfiguration of intercompany accounts. These changes have the effect of altering intercompany balances among segments, thus altering reported total segment assets.  Total segment assets presented in the Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Release reflect the changes described above.  This conversion had no impact on segment results, segment capital or return on segment capital metrics.

CAPITAL
Since the inception of repurchase programs in December 1994, 699MM shares have been acquired under cumulative Board authorizations to repurchase up to 770MM shares.  On a cumulative basis, since 1994 the Company has distributed 63% of capital generated through share repurchases and dividends.
On January 7, 2011, the Company submitted its Comprehensive Capital Plan (CCP) to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the Federal Reserve).  The CCP included an analysis of performance and capital availability under certain adverse economic assumptions, as well as a capital distribution plan outlining the Companys plans to return capital to shareholders in 2011 through dividends and share repurchases.  On March 18, 2011, the Company was informed that the Federal Reserve had no objections to the Companys 2011 capital distribution plan.   The total number of shares repurchased in 2011 will be based on the Companys business plans and financial performance, and will be consistent with its submitted capital distribution plan.
As the Company has previously disclosed, its objective is to return to shareholders, on average and over time, approximately 50% of the capital it generates through a combination of dividends and the repurchase of common shares.

On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued the Basel III rules text, which presents details of global regulatory standards on bank capital adequacy and liquidity agreed to by the Governors and Heads of Supervision, and endorsed by the G20 Leaders at their November 2010 summit.  While final implementation of the rules related to capital ratios will be determined by the Federal Reserve, the Company estimates that had the new rules been in place during Q211, the reported tier 1 common and tier 1 capital ratios would decline by approximately 40 basis points.  In addition, the impact of the new rules on the reported Tier 1 leverage ratio would be a decline of approximately 160 basis points.

Supplemental Information  Tangible Common Equity and Total Adjusted Assets
During the third quarter of 2006, the Company issued $750MM of 6.80% Subordinated Debentures due 2036 (Subordinated Debentures), which are automatically extendable until 2066 unless certain events occur prior to that date. In connection with the Subordinated Debentures, the Company has undertaken to disclose on a quarterly basis the amount of its tangible common equity and total adjusted assets, as defined in the Subordinated Debentures.  The Companys consolidated tangible common equity amount as of the end of any fiscal quarter means total shareholders equity, excluding preferred stock, of the Company as reflected on its consolidated balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP as of such fiscal quarter end minus (i) intangible assets and goodwill and (ii) deferred acquisition costs, as determined in accordance with GAAP and reflected in such consolidated balance sheet.  The Companys total adjusted assets as of the end of any fiscal quarter is calculated as the sum of (i) total consolidated assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet minus (ii) non-securitized Cardmember loan receivables (without deduction for reserves), which are set forth on the Companys balance sheet, plus (iii) managed (i.e., securitized and non-securitized) worldwide Cardmember loan receivables as reported by the Company for such fiscal quarter.  Upon the adoption of new GAAP effective  January 1, 2010, the Companys total consolidated assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet now are the same amount as would be calculated as total adjusted assets each as defined in the Subordinated Debentures before the change in GAAP.  As of June 30, 2011, the Companys tangible common equity was $14B and its total adjusted assets as defined in the Subordinated Debentures, were $148B.  As of June 30, 2011, the consolidated total assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet were also $148B.
