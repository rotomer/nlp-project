EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  
 
 
 
Consolidated provisions for losses totaled $249 million compared to $373 million in the year-ago period reflecting continued improvement in credit quality.
Overall expense growth slowed significantly from the growth rates of recent quarters. Consolidated expenses totaled $5.6 billion, up 13 percent from $5.0 billion a year ago reflecting higher rewards costs, which were partially offset by lower marketing and promotion expenses. The increase also reflected investments in certain business building initiatives. Consolidated expenses in the year ago period reflect the receipt of a settlement payment from MasterCard in the amount of $150 million.  Consolidated expenses of $5.6 billion in the current period rose 10 percent when compared to adjusted consolidated expenses of $5.1 billion in the year ago period, which excludes the MasterCard settlement payment.

The company's return on average equity (ROE) was 27.8 percent, up from 25.9 percent a year ago.
We delivered strong bottom line results across all of our business segments this quarter, said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive officer.  Revenue growth reflected a continuing return on the investments were making to enhance the services we provide consumers, small businesses, merchants and corporate customers.
Cardmember spending was strong during the period, growing 16 percent to record levels and again outpacing most of the major bank card issuers.  Credit quality continued to be excellent, with key lending metrics improving from the historically strong levels we achieved earlier in the year.  The growth in operating expenses moderated this quarter, as planned, and we expect to further slow that growth towards the end of this year and into next.
"The overall results are showing the benefit of moves weve made to improve our risk profile, capture a greater share of cardmember spending, grow fee-based revenues and build additional flexibility into the way we manage expenses.  Those moves have put us in a strong competitive position.  They have also generated resources to invest in initiatives that bring customers and merchants more closely together as the worlds of online and offline commerce converge.
We have been generating strong momentum and plan to continue investing to grow the business.  But, against the backdrop of an uncertain economic environment, we are focused on maintaining a strong risk profile and carefully managing expenses.
________________________________
 
Adjusted consolidated expenses for the year ago period and the adjusted growth rate are non-GAAP measures. The company believes the use of adjusted consolidated expenses and the adjusted growth rate are helpful to investors by comparing the companys consolidated expenses in the current period to that of the year ago period without the impact of the MasterCard settlement payments, the last of which was received in the second quarter 2011.

(A) Card billed business includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements (non-proprietary billed business), and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards. In-store spend activity within retail co-brand portfolios in Global Network Services, from which the Company earns no revenue, is not included in non-proprietary billed business. Card billed business is reflected in the United States or outside the United States based on where the cardmember is domiciled.
(B) Total cards-in-force represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding. Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner and does not include additional supplemental cards issued on that account. Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force include basic and supplemental cards issued to employee cardmembers. Non-proprietary cards-in-force includes all cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for retail co-brand cardmember accounts which have no out-of-store spend activity during the prior 12 month period.
(C) Prior to and including the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company did not have the data necessary to separately report Basic and Supplementary cards-in-force (CIF) for Global Network Services; therefore, all cards-in-force for Global Network Services was reported as Basic CIF. Starting in the first quarter of 2011, as the necessary data became available, the Company began to separately report Basic and Supplementary CIF for Global Network Services. The Company has accordingly revised prior periods to conform with the current period presentation.
(D) This calculation is designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general purpose American Express cards. It represents the percentage of billed business (both proprietary and Global Network Services) retained by the Company from merchants it acquires, prior to payments to third parties unrelated to merchant acceptance.
(E) Average basic cardmember spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only. Average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs, plus card fees included in interest and fees on loans (including related amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs), divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force. The card fees related to cardmember loans included in interest and fees on loans were $66 million and $58 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The adjusted average fee per card, which is a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs (a portion of which is charge card related and included in net card fees and a portion of which is lending related and included in interest and fees on loans). The amount of amortization excluded was $52 million and $49 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company presents adjusted average fee per card because the Company believes this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products.

(A) Represents loss provisions for cardmember receivables consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee reserve components.
(B) The Company presents a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention. In addition, because the Company's practice is to include uncollectible interest and/or fees as part of its total provision for losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented.
(C) See Appendix III for calculations of net interest yield on cardmember loans, a non-GAAP measure, and net interest income divided by average loans, a GAAP measure. The Company believes net interest yield on cardmember loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of the Companys cardmember loan portfolio.
(D) This calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the cardmember loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on cardmember loans. The calculation includes interest income and interest expense attributable to investment securities and other interest-bearing deposits as well as to cardmember loans, and interest expense attributable to other activities, including cardmember receivables.

(A) Return on average equity and return on average common equity are calculated by dividing one year period net income/net income attributable to common shareholders by one year average total shareholders equity/average common shareholders' equity, respectively.
(B) Return on average tangible common equity is computed in the same manner as return on average common equity except the computation of average tangible common shareholders' equity, a non-GAAP measure, excludes from average total shareholders' equity, average goodwill and other intangibles of $4.0 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2011, $3.7 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, $3.5 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2011, $3.3 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2010 and $3.2 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2010. The Company believes that return on average tangible common equity is a useful measure of the profitability of its business.

(A) Represents net interest income allocated to the Company's cardmember loan portfolio excluding the impact of card fees on loans and balance transfer fees attributable to the Company's cardmember loans.
(B) Represents average cardmember loans excluding the impact of deferred card fees, net of deferred direct acquisition costs of cardmember loans.
(C) This calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the cardmember loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on cardmember loans. The calculation includes interest income and interest expense attributable to investment securities and other interest-bearing deposits as well as to cardmember loans, and interest expense attributable to other activities, including cardmember receivables.
(D) Net interest yield on cardmember loans, a non-GAAP measure, is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by adjusted average loans, computed on an annualized basis. The calculation of net interest yield on cardmember loans includes interest that is deemed uncollectible. For all presentations of net interest yield on cardmember loans, reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses - cardmember loans; therefore, such reserves and net write-offs are not included in the net interest yield calculation.

CAPITAL
Since the inception of repurchase programs in December 1994, 725MM shares have been acquired under cumulative Board authorizations to repurchase up to 770MM shares.  On a cumulative basis, since 1994 the Company has distributed 64% of capital generated through share repurchases and dividends.
As the Company has previously disclosed, its objective is to return to shareholders, on average and over time, approximately 50% of the capital it generates through a combination of dividends and the repurchase of common shares. The Company is executing its share repurchase program, subject to market conditions, pursuant to its capital plan to repurchase up to $2.3B of common shares in 2011.

On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued the Basel III rules text, which presents details of global regulatory standards on bank capital adequacy and liquidity agreed to by the Governors and Heads of Supervision, and endorsed by the G20 Leaders at their November 2010 summit.  While final implementation of the rules related to capital ratios will be determined by the Federal Reserve, the Company estimates that had the new rules been in place during Q311, the reported Tier 1 common and Tier 1 capital ratios would decline by approximately 30 basis points.  In addition, the impact of the new rules on the reported Tier 1 leverage ratio would be a decline of approximately 170 basis points.

Tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, excludes goodwill and other intangibles of $4.4B from total shareholders equity of $18.1B.  The Company believes presenting the ratio of tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets is a useful measure of evaluating the strength of the Companys capital position.

As reported in this Earnings Supplement, F/X adjusted information, a non-GAAP measure,  assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the three months ended September 30, 2011 apply to the period(s) against which such results are being compared). The company believes the use of adjusted consolidated expenses and the adjusted growth rate are helpful to investors by comparing the company's consolidated expenses in the current period to that of the year ago period without the impact of the MasterCard settlement payments, the last of which was received in the second quarter 2011.

Supplemental Information  Tangible Common Equity and Total Adjusted Assets
During the third quarter of 2006, the Company issued $750MM of 6.80% Subordinated Debentures due 2036 (Subordinated Debentures), which are automatically extendable until 2066 unless certain events occur prior to that date. In connection with the Subordinated Debentures, the Company has undertaken to disclose on a quarterly basis the amount of its tangible common equity and total adjusted assets, as defined in the Subordinated Debentures.  The Companys consolidated tangible common equity amount as of the end of any fiscal quarter means total shareholders equity, excluding preferred stock, of the Company as reflected on its consolidated balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP as of such fiscal quarter end minus (i) intangible assets and goodwill and (ii) deferred acquisition costs, as determined in accordance with GAAP and reflected in such consolidated balance sheet.  The Companys total adjusted assets as of the end of any fiscal quarter is calculated as the sum of (i) total consolidated assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet minus (ii) non-securitized Cardmember loan receivables (without deduction for reserves), which are set forth on the Companys balance sheet, plus (iii) managed (i.e., securitized and non-securitized) worldwide Cardmember loan receivables as reported by the Company for such fiscal quarter.  Upon the adoption of new GAAP effective  January 1, 2010, the Companys total consolidated assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet now are the same amount as would be calculated as total adjusted assets as defined in the Subordinated Debentures before the change in GAAP.  As of September 30, 2011, the Companys tangible common equity was $14B and its total adjusted assets each as defined in the Subordinated Debentures, were $149B.  As of September 30, 2011, the consolidated total assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet were also $149B.
