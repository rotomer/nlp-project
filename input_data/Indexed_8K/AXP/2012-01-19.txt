AMERICAN EXPRESS REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER EPS OF $1.01, UP 15% FROM A YEAR AGO
 
 
# Denotes a variance of more than 100 %
 
New York  January 19, 2012 -today reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.2 billion, up 12 percent from $1.1 billion in the year-ago period. Diluted earnings per share was $1.01, up 15 percent from $0.88 a year ago.
American Express Company (NYSE: AXP)
Consolidated total revenues net of interest expense were $7.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011, up 7 percent from $7.2 billion in the year-ago period. The increase largely reflected continued strong growth in cardmember spending and higher travel commissions and fees. These increases were partially offset by a slight decrease in net interest income that reflected lower yields on the loan portfolio.

Adjusted for foreign currency translations, consolidated total revenues net of interest expense also rose 7 percent this quarter compared to a 6 percent increase (9 percent before adjustment) in the third quarter of 2011.

Consolidated provisions for losses totaled $409 million compared to $239 million in the year-ago period. The provision increase reflected a larger reserve release in the year-ago period and higher loans outstanding in the current period, partially offset by lower net write-offs in the current period. Credit indicators continued to be at historically low levels.
Consolidated expenses totaled $5.6 billion, up 1 percent from $5.5 billion in the year-ago period. That increase was a significant reduction from the growth rates of recent quarters and reflected lower marketing and promotion expenses, slower increases in rewards costs and, as planned, slower growth in operating expenses. The current quarter results include $49 million ($32 million after-tax) of restructuring and other reengineering costs compared to $113 million ($74 million after-tax) from the year-ago period.
 
The effective tax rate was 32 percent, compared to 28 percent in the year-ago quarter.
The company's return on average equity (ROE) was 27.7 percent, up from 27.5 percent a year ago.
Results for the quarter underscored the ability of our spend-centric model to generate revenue and earnings growth at a time when consumer behavior and regulations are changing the economics of the revolving credit business, said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive officer, American Express.
Cardmembers spent a record amount on their American Express cards, continuing a trend that has translated into overall share gains during the last two years. Billed business rose 11 percent, showing broad-based improvements from the strong levels of a year ago. Online spending was strong as we capitalized on the accelerating popularity of digital commerce. Revolving credit balances grew, but at a much slower rate than spending as Cardmembers continued to manage their debt and household finances more cautiously. Credit quality remained excellent, with past-due loans and write-offs at historically low levels.

While we continued to make substantial investments in the business, we adjusted our budgets to reflect the end of the receipt of litigation-related payments and a diminishing benefit from reserve releases. As planned, operating expense growth declined significantly from the level of prior quarters.
The overall recovery in the U.S. remains uneven and the environment in Europe continues to pose challenges for the global economy. But, we start 2012 from a position of strength and with a unique network that connects millions of consumers, merchants and businesses around the world. A network based on service, relationships, data and market insights is a tremendous asset for a digital age when the boundaries between online and offline commerce are being quickly redefined.
Segment Results
reported fourth-quarter net income of $727 million, up 4 percent from $700 million in the year-ago period.
U.S. Card Services
 
Total revenues net of interest expense increased 5 percent to $3.9 billion from $3.7 billion in the year-ago period. The increase was driven by higher cardmember spending and slightly higher net interest income despite lower yields on the loan portfolio.
Provisions for losses totaled $269 million, up from $111 million in the year-ago period. The provision increase reflected a larger reserve release in the year-ago period and higher loans outstanding in the current period, partially offset by lower net write-offs in the current period. Credit indicators continued to be at historically low levels.
Total expenses decreased 4 percent. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses remained flat to the year-ago period. Higher volume-related rewards and cardmember services costs were offset by lower marketing and promotion costs. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased 10 percent, primarily reflecting higher restructuring and other reengineering costs in the year-ago period.
The effective tax rate was 38 percent compared to 34 percent in the year-ago quarter.
reported fourth-quarter net income of $152 million, up 54 percent from $99 million in the yearago period.
International Card Services
Total revenues net of interest expense increased 8 percent to $1.3 billion. The benefit from higher cardmember spending and revenues related to Loyalty Partner were partially offset by lower net interest income.
Provisions for losses totaled $84 million, up 5 percent from $80 million in the year-ago period.
Total expenses increased 5 percent, primarily reflecting the acquisition of Loyalty Partner earlier in the year. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses rose 9 percent from year-ago levels, and included increased investments in marketing and promotion and higher volume-related rewards costs. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased 3 percent from year-ago levels.

Global Network & Merchant Services
 
Total revenues net of interest expense increased 12 percent to $1.3 billion, from $1.2 billion, reflecting higher merchant-related revenues driven by an increase in global cardmember spending, as well as an increase in revenues from Global Network Services bank partners.
Total expenses increased 2 percent. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses increased 5 percent from the year-ago period. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased 2 percent.

(A)  Card billed business includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements (non-proprietary billed business), and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards.  In-store spend activity within retail co-brand portfolios in Global Network Services, from which the Company earns no revenue, is not included in non-proprietary billed business.  Card billed business is reflected in the United States or outside the United States based on where the cardmember is domiciled.
(B) Total cards-in-force represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding.  Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner and does not include additional supplemental cards issued on that account.  Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force include basic and supplemental cards issued to employee cardmembers.  Non-proprietary cards-in-force includes all cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for retail co-brand cardmember accounts that have no out-of-store spend activity during the prior 12 month period.
(C)  Prior to and including the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company did not have the data necessary to separately report Basic and Supplementary cards-in-force (CIF) for Global Network Services; therefore, all cards-in-force for Global Network Services was reported as Basic CIF. Starting in the first quarter of 2011, as the necessary data became available, the Company began to separately report Basic and Supplementary CIF for Global Network Services.  The Company has accordingly revised prior periods to conform with the current period presentation.
(D)  This calculation is designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general purpose American Express cards.  It represents the percentage of billed business (both proprietary and Global Network Services) retained by the Company from merchants it acquires, prior to payments to third parties unrelated to merchant acceptance.
(E)  Average basic cardmember spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only.  Average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs, plus card fees included in interest and fees on loans (including related amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs), divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force.  The card fees related to cardmember loans included in interest and fees on loans were $67 million and $63 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $265 million and $220 million for the years ended December 31, 2011and 2010, respectively.  The adjusted average fee per card, which is a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs (a portion of which is charge card related and included in net card fees and a portion of which is lending related and included in interest and fees on loans).  The amount of amortization excluded
was $57 million and $51 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $219 million and $207 million for the years ended Decemer 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  The Company presents adjusted average fee per card because the Company believes this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products.

(A)  Represents loss provisions for cardmember receivables consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee reserve components.
(B)  The Company presents a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention.  In addition, because the Company's practice is to include uncollectible interest and/or fees as part of its total provision for losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented.
(C) Effective January 1, 2010, $29.0 billion of the Companys securitized portfolio of cardmember loans along with a $2.5 billion loan loss reserve were consolidated on the Company's balance sheets due to the consolidation of the American Express Credit Account Master Trust upon the adoption of GAAP governing the accounting for transfers of financial assets and consolidation of variable interest entities.
(D)  See Appendix III for calculations of net interest yield on cardmember loans, a non-GAAP measure, and net interest income divided by average loans, a GAAP measure.  The Company believes net interest yield on cardmember loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of the Companys cardmember loan portfolio.
(E)  This calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the cardmember loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on cardmember loans. The calculation includes interest income and interest expense attributable to investment securities and other interest-bearing deposits as well as to cardmember loans, and interest expense attributable to other activities, including cardmember receivables.

The adjusted average fee per card, a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs (a portion of which is charge card related and included in net card fees and a portion of which is lending related and included in interest and fees on loans).

The Company presents adjusted average fee per card because the Company believes this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products.

The calculation includes interest income and interest expense attributable to investment securities and other interest-bearing deposits as well as to cardmember loans, and interest expense attributable to other activities, including cardmember receivables.
 
(D)  Net interest yield on cardmember loans, a non-GAAP measure, is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by adjusted average loans, computed on an annualized basis.  The calculation of net interest yield on cardmember loans includes interest that is deemed uncollectible. For all presentations of net interest yield on cardmember loans, reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses - cardmember loans; therefore, such reserves and net write-offs are not included in the net interest yield calculation.

CAPITAL
Since the inception of repurchase programs in December 1994, 732MM shares have been acquired under cumulative Board authorizations to repurchase up to 770MM shares.  On a cumulative basis, since 1994 the Company has distributed 63% of capital generated through share repurchases and dividends.

On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued the Basel III rules text, which presents details of global regulatory standards on bank capital adequacy and liquidity agreed to by the Governors and Heads of Supervision, and endorsed by the G20 Leaders at their November 2010 summit.  While final implementation of the rules related to capital ratios will be determined by the Federal Reserve, the Company estimates that had the new rules been in place during Q411, the reported Tier 1 common and Tier 1 capital ratios would decline by approximately 30 basis points but would remain above expected regulatory thresholds.  In addition, the impact of the new rules on the reported Tier 1 leverage ratio would be a decline of approximately 160 basis points.

Funding Plan:
 
The Companys funding plan for the full year 2012 includes, among other sources, approximately $3B to $9B of unsecured term debt issuance and $1B to $6B of secured term debt issuance. The Companys funding plans are subject to various risks and uncertainties, such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity, demand for securities offered by the Company, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell receivables, and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions. Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond the Companys control.

Supplemental Information  Tangible Common Equity and Total Adjusted Assets
During the third quarter of 2006, the Company issued $750MM of 6.80% Subordinated Debentures due 2036 (Subordinated Debentures), which are automatically extendable until 2066 unless certain events occur prior to that date. In connection with the Subordinated Debentures, the Company has undertaken to disclose on a quarterly basis the amount of its tangible common equity and total adjusted assets, as defined in the Subordinated Debentures.  The Companys consolidated tangible common equity amount as of the end of any fiscal quarter means total shareholders equity, excluding preferred stock, of the Company as reflected on its consolidated balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP as of such fiscal quarter end minus (i) intangible assets and goodwill and (ii) deferred acquisition costs, as determined in accordance with GAAP and reflected in such consolidated balance sheet.  The Companys total adjusted assets as of the end of any fiscal quarter is calculated as the sum of (i) total consolidated assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet minus (ii) non-securitized Cardmember loan receivables (without deduction for reserves), which are set forth on the Companys balance sheet, plus (iii) managed (i.e., securitized and non-securitized) worldwide Cardmember loan receivables as reported by the Company for such fiscal quarter.  Upon the adoption of new GAAP effective  January 1, 2010, the Companys total consolidated assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet now are the same amount as would be calculated as total adjusted assets as defined in the Subordinated Debentures before the change in GAAP.  As of December 31, 2011, the Companys tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, was $14B and its total adjusted assets each as defined in the Subordinated Debentures, were $153B.  As of December 31, 2011, the consolidated total assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet were also $153B.
