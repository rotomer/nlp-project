On January 9, 2012, American Express Company (the Company) submitted its Comprehensive Capital Plan (CCP) to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve).  The CCP included an analysis of performance and capital availability under certain adverse economic assumptions, as well as a capital distribution plan outlining the Companys plans to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases of up to $4 billion during 2012 and up to $1 billion in the first quarter of 2013, as well as an increase in the Companys quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share from $0.18 per share, subject to approval of the Companys Board of Directors.
On March 13, 2012, the Company was informed that the Federal Reserve had no objections to the Companys capital distribution plan. The actual number of shares that will be repurchased will be based on the Companys business plans, financial performance and market conditions. As the Company has previously disclosed, its objective is to return to shareholders, on average and over time, approximately 50% of the capital it generates, through a combination of dividends and the repurchase of the Companys common shares.  To facilitate repurchases, the Company may, from time to time, make purchases pursuant to one or more trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which allows the Company to repurchase common shares during periods when the Company might otherwise be prevented from doing so under applicable law or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods.
