FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 The board of directors of American Express Company today approved a $0.02  or 11 percent  increase in the quarterly dividend on the companys common stock. The dividend was raised to $0.20 a share, from $0.18, payable May 10, 2012 to shareholders of record on April 5, 2012.
NEW YORK  March 26, 2012
Todays decision marks the first increase since November 2007, when the dividend was increased to $0.18 from $0.15. American Express continued to pay its regular quarterly dividend without interruption throughout the recent recession.
The board also authorized the repurchase of up to 150 million common shares from time to time, in accordance with the companys capital distribution plans approved by the Federal Reserve and subject to market conditions. This authorization replaces the prior 200 million share repurchase program that had approximately 38 million shares of common stock remaining under board authorization.
As previously announced on March 13, 2012, the company was informed that the Federal Reserve had no objections to the companys capital distribution plan
outlining the companys plans to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases of up to $4 billion during 2012 and up to $1 billion in the first quarter of 2013, as well as the increase in the companys quarterly dividend. The actual number of shares that will be repurchased will be based on the companys business plans, financial performance and market conditions.
