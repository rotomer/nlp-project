AMERICAN EXPRESS REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EPS OF $1.07, UP 10% FROM A YEAR AGO
REVENUES AND CARDMEMBER SPENDING RISE, CREDIT QUALITY REMAINS EXCELLENT
 
 
New York  April 18, 2012 -today reported first quarter net income of $1.3 billion, up 7 percent from $1.2 billion a year ago.  Diluted earnings per share was $1.07, up 10 percent from $0.97.
American Express Company (NYSE: AXP)
Consolidated total revenues net of interest expense rose 8 percent to $7.6 billion in the first quarter of 2012, from $7 billion a year ago.  The increase reflects strong cardmember spending and higher net interest income driven by moderate growth in the loan portfolio.
Consolidated provisions for losses totaled $412 million, up from $97 million a year ago. This increase reflects a larger lending reserve release in the year ago period, partially offset by lower net write-offs in the current quarter. Credit quality continued to be at historically strong levels.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Consolidated expenses totaled $5.4 billion, up 4 percent from $5.2 billion a year ago. The increase primarily reflects higher salaries, employee benefits and other operating expenses, which were partially offset by lower marketing, promotion and rewards expenses. In the year ago period, consolidated expenses were reduced by the receipt of settlement payments from MasterCard and Visa totaling $220 million.
The effective tax rate was 29 percent, down from 32 percent in the year ago quarter. The tax rate reflects the realization of certain foreign tax credits.
The company's return on average equity (ROE) was 27.1 percent, down from 27.9 percent a year ago.
Higher cardmember spending, excellent credit metrics and disciplined expense management helped us to start 2012 with record first-quarter earnings and revenues, said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive officer.  Spending on the American Express network rose 12 percent, remaining strong throughout the quarter, both in the U.S. and internationally.  Credit quality continues to be among the best we have ever experienced, and our lending portfolio continued to grow at moderate levels.
The underlying strength of the business allowed us to add to the competitive advantages of our card products and introduce new digital services that create value for merchants and customers who choose to pay with American Express.
Coming into the quarter, we wanted to be particularly vigilant in managing discretionary expenses.  We knew we wouldn't have the same benefit from reserve releases and settlement payments from Visa or MasterCard that we had received last year.  We were also concerned about the uneven recovery in the U.S. and a European environment that posed challenges to the global economy.
While credit quality and business conditions stayed favorable, we maintained our focus on containing costs and kept the growth rate in total expenses well below that of our revenues.
Our overall performance again underscored the advantages of our spend-centric business model, as did the results of a financial review, or stress test, of major financial companies that was completed by the Federal Reserve this quarter.  American Express ranked among the highest in the group, and the Fed notified us that it had no objections to raising our quarterly dividend or repurchasing shares.
As a result, we increased our quarterly dividend by 11 percent to $0.20 per share, from the $0.18 level that we maintained throughout the financial crisis and recession.  We are also moving ahead with plans to repurchase as much as $4 billion of outstanding shares this year and an additional $1 billion in the first quarter of 2013.

(A)  Card billed business includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements (non-proprietary billed business), and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards.  In-store spend activity within retail co-brand portfolios in Global Network Services, from which the Company earns no revenue, is not included in non-proprietary billed business.  Card billed business is reflected in the United States or outside the United States based on where the cardmember is domiciled.
(B)  Total cards-in-force represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding.  Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner and does not include additional supplemental cards issued on that account.  Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force include basic and supplemental cards issued to employee cardmembers.  Non-proprietary cards-in-force includes all cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for retail co-brand cardmember accounts that have no out-of-store spend activity during the prior 12 month period.
(C)  This calculation is designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general purpose American Express cards.  It represents the percentage of billed business (both proprietary and Global Network Services) retained by the Company from merchants it acquires, prior to payments to third parties unrelated to merchant acceptance.
(D)  Average basic card member spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only. Average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs divided by average worldwide proprietary card-in-force.  The adjusted average fee per card, which is a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs. The amount of amortization excluded was $65 million and $54 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Company presents adjusted average fee per card because the Company believes this metric presents a useful indicator of card fees pricing across a range of its proprietary card products.

(B)  The Company presents a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention.  In addition, because the Company's practice is to include uncollectible interest and/or fees as part of its total provision for losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented.
(C)  See Appendix III for calculations of net interest yield on cardmember loans, a non-GAAP measure, and net interest income divided by average loans, a GAAP measure.

For all presentations of net interest yield on cardmember loans, reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses - cardmember loans; therefore, such reserves and net write-offs are not included in the net interest yield calculation.

CAPITAL
On March 13, 2012, the Company was informed that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve) had no objections to the Comprehensive Capital Plan (CCP) that it had submitted in January, 2012.  The CCP included an analysis of performance and capital availability under certain adverse economic assumptions, as well as a capital distribution plan outlining the Companys plans to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases of up to $4B during 2012 and up to $1B in the first quarter of 2013, as well as an increase in the Companys quarterly dividend from $0.18 per share to $0.20 per share.
On March 26, 2012, the Board of Directors approved the dividend increase and authorized the repurchase of up to 150MM common shares over time, in accordance with the Companys capital plans approved by the Federal Reserve and subject to market conditions.  This authorization replaces all prior repurchase authorizations.  
Subsequent to the Federal Reserve notification, the Company repurchased 4MM common shares at an average price of $57.53 in Q112 versus 7MM common shares in Q411. There were no share repurchases in Q111. On a cumulative basis since 1994, the Company has distributed 63% of capital generated through share repurchases and dividends.

On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued the Basel III rules text, which presents details of global regulatory standards on bank capital adequacy and liquidity agreed to by the Governors and Heads of Supervision, and endorsed by the G20 Leaders at their November 2010 summit.  While final implementation of the rules related to capital ratios will be determined by the Federal Reserve and released during 2012, the Company estimates that had the new rules been in place during Q112, the reported Tier 1 common and Tier 1 capital ratios would decline by approximately 40 basis points but would remain above expected regulatory thresholds.  In addition, the impact of the new rules on the reported Tier 1 leverage ratio would be a decline of approximately 170 basis points.

Supplemental Information  Tangible Common Equity and Total Adjusted Assets
During the third quarter of 2006, the Company issued $750MM of 6.80% Subordinated Debentures due 2036 (Subordinated Debentures), which are automatically extendable until 2066 unless certain events occur prior to that date. In connection with the Subordinated Debentures, the Company has undertaken to disclose on a quarterly basis the amount of its tangible common equity and total adjusted assets, as defined in the Subordinated Debentures.  The Companys consolidated tangible common equity amount as of the end of any fiscal quarter means total shareholders equity, excluding preferred stock, of the Company as reflected on its consolidated balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP as of such fiscal quarter end minus (i) intangible assets and goodwill and (ii) deferred acquisition costs, as determined in accordance with GAAP and reflected in such consolidated balance sheet.  The Companys total adjusted assets as of the end of any fiscal quarter is calculated as the sum of (i) total consolidated assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet minus (ii) non-securitized Cardmember loan receivables (without deduction for reserves), which are set forth on the Companys balance sheet, plus (iii) managed (i.e., securitized and non-securitized) worldwide Cardmember loan receivables as reported by the Company for such fiscal quarter.  Upon the adoption of new GAAP effective  January 1, 2010, the Companys total consolidated assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet now are the same amount as would be calculated as total adjusted assets as defined in the Subordinated Debentures before the change in GAAP.  As of March 31, 2012, the Companys tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, was $16B and its total adjusted assets each as defined in the Subordinated Debentures, were $152B.  As of March 31, 2012, the consolidated total assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet were $152B.
