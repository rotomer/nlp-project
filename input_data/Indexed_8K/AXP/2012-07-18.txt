# Denotes a variance of more than 100 percent
 
-today reported second-quarter income from continuing operations of $1.3 billion, up 3 percent from a year ago. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.15, up 7 percent from $1.07 a year ago.
New York  July 18, 2012
American Express Company (NYSE: AXP)
Net income, which includes discontinued operations, totaled $1.3 billion, up 1 percent from a year ago. Per-share, net income was $1.15, up 5 percent from $1.10 a year ago.
 
______________________________________
Income from discontinued operations primarily reflects the resolution of certain prior years tax items related to American Express Bank Ltd., which was sold to Standard Chartered PLC during Q108.
1
Represents income from continuing operations or net income, as applicable, less earnings allocated to participating share awards of $14 million and $15 million for the three months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and $28 million and $30 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Consolidated total revenues net of interest expense rose 5 percent to $8.0 billion in the second quarter, from $7.6 billion a year ago. The increase was driven by continuing growth in cardmember spending, higher other revenues and higher net interest income, which primarily reflected growth in the cardmember loan portfolio.
Adjusted for foreign currency translations, consolidated total revenues net of interest expense rose 7 percent, compared to the year ago quarter.
3
Consolidated provisions for losses totaled $461 million, up 29 percent from $357 million a year ago. This increase reflects higher reserve releases in the year ago period, partially offset by lower net write-offs in the current quarter. Credit indicators continued to be at historically strong levels.
Consolidated expenses totaled $5.6 billion, up 2 percent from $5.5 billion last year. Year ago expenses were reduced by the receipt of settlement payments from MasterCard and Visa totaling $220 million. The current quarter expenses reflect lower marketing, promotion and rewards expenses, along with lower salaries costs, offset by an increase in other operating expenses.
Adjusted for foreign currency translations, consolidated total expenses grew 4 percent compared to the year ago quarter.
3
The effective tax rate was 29 percent, up from 27 percent in the year ago quarter. The current quarters tax rate reflects the realization of certain foreign tax credits, while the prior period tax rate reflects the impact of the favorable resolution of certain prior years tax items.
The company's return on average equity (ROE) was 26.6 percent, down from 28.2 percent a year ago.
Consumer, small business and corporate cardmember spending, along with the business volumes generated by our network of bank partners, remained healthy despite a very uneven economy, said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive officer.
Overall cardmember spending rose 7 percent, or 9 percent adjusted for foreign currency translations. Thats slower than the increases weve seen in the recent quarters, but it comes on top of a very strong performance a year ago, and continues to grow faster than most of our large issuer competitors.
The cardmember loan portfolio grew 4 percent, and credit indicators, which were excellent at the start of the year, improved even further this quarter.
Given the uncertain economic outlook, we remained vigilant in managing discretionary expenses but continued to make substantial investments in marketing initiatives and leverage our loyalty programs to connect millions of consumers and businesses around the world. This helped to continue strengthening our relationships with merchants and cardmembers at a time when mobile and digital technologies are opening up a range of new possibilities.
 
______________________________________ 
As reported in this release, FX adjusted information, which constitute non-GAAP financial measures, assume a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the three months ended June 30, 2012 apply to the period(s) against which such results are being compared). The company believes the presentation of information on an F/X adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare the company's performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

All information in the following tables is presented on a basis prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), unless otherwise indicated. The Company revised the income statement reporting of card fees on lending products in the first quarter of 2012, increasing Net card fees and reducing Interest on loans. Corresponding amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. This change does not impact Total revenues net of interest expense in the income statement, or the Net interest yield on cardmember loans, a non-GAAP measure.

(A)  Card billed business includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements (non-proprietary billed business), and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards.  In-store spend activity within retail co-brand portfolios in Global Network Services, from which the Company earns no revenue, is not included in non-proprietary billed business.  Card billed business is reflected in the United States or outside the United States based on where the cardmember is domiciled.
(B)  Total cards-in-force represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding.  Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner and does not include additional supplemental cards issued on that account.  Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force include basic and supplemental cards issued to employee cardmembers.  Non-proprietary cards-in-force includes all cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for retail co-brand cardmember accounts that have no out-of-store spend activity during the prior 12 month period.
(C)  This calculation is designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general purpose American Express cards.  It represents the percentage of billed business (both proprietary and Global Network Services) retained by the Company from merchants it acquires, prior to payments to third parties unrelated to merchant acceptance.
(D)  Average basic card member spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only. Average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force.  The adjusted average fee per card, which is a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs. The amount of amortization excluded was $64 million and $56 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Company presents adjusted average fee per card because the Company believes this metric presents a useful indicator of card fees pricing across a range of its proprietary card products.

(B) Provisions for unauthorized transactions.
(C) Consists of principal (resulting from authorized transactions)  interest and/or fees, less recoveries.
(D) For cardmember receivables, includes net write-offs for unauthorized transactions of $(30) million and $(41) million for the three months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively; foreign currency translation adjustments of $(5) million and $2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively; and other adjustments of $4 million and nil for the three months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. For cardmember loans, includes net write-offs for unauthorized transactions of $(25) million and $(28) million for the three months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively; foreign currency translation adjustments of $(11) million and $2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively; and other adjustments of $(4) million and nil for the three months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
 
(E)  The Company presents a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention.  In addition, because the Company's practice is to include uncollectible interest and/or fees as part of its total provision for losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented.

(C)  This calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the cardmember loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on cardmember loans. The calculation includes interest income and interest expense attributable to investment securities and other interest-bearing deposits as well as to cardmember loans, and interest expense attributable to other activities, including cardmember receivables.
 
(D)  Net interest yield on cardmember loans, a non-GAAP measure, is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by adjusted average loans, computed on an annualized basis.  The calculation of net interest yield on cardmember loans includes interest that is deemed uncollectible. For all presentations of net interest yield on cardmember loans, reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses - cardmember loans; therefore, such reserves and net write-offs are not included in the net interest yield calculation. The Company believes net interest yield on cardmember loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of the Company's cardmember loan portfolio.

On June 7, 2012, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation issued three joint notices of proposed rulemaking text, collectively referred to as Basel III, which presents details of the new U.S. regulatory capital standards. The Company estimates that had the new rules been in place, and were finalized as proposed, during Q212, the reported Tier 1 common and Tier 1 capital ratios would decline by approximately 30 basis points and the reported Tier 1 leverage ratio would decline by approximately 10 basis points, but would remain above expected regulatory thresholds. These ratios are calculated using the standardized approach as described in the proposed rules. The Companys previous estimate of expected Tier 1 leverage ratio impact has been clarified under the proposed rules and is now captured under a new supplementary leverage ratio. For Q212, this supplementary leverage ratio would have been approximately 9.0%.

Supplemental Information  Tangible Common Equity and Total Adjusted Assets
During the third quarter of 2006, the Company issued $750MM of 6.80% Subordinated Debentures due 2036 (Subordinated Debentures), which are automatically extendable until 2066 unless certain events occur prior to that date. In connection with the Subordinated Debentures, the Company has undertaken to disclose on a quarterly basis the amount of its tangible common equity and total adjusted assets, as defined in the Subordinated Debentures. The Companys consolidated tangible common equity amount as of the end of any fiscal quarter means total shareholders equity, excluding preferred stock, of the Company as reflected on its consolidated balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP as of such fiscal quarter end minus (i) intangible assets and goodwill and (ii) deferred acquisition costs, as determined in accordance with GAAP and reflected in such consolidated balance sheet. The Companys total adjusted assets as of the end of any fiscal quarter is calculated as the sum of (i) total consolidated assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet minus (ii) non-securitized cardmember loan receivables (without deduction for reserves), which are set forth on the Companys balance sheet, plus (iii) managed (i.e., securitized and non-securitized) worldwide cardmember loan receivables as reported by the Company for such fiscal quarter. Upon the adoption of new GAAP effective January 1, 2010, the Companys total consolidated assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet now are the same amount as would be calculated as total adjusted assets as defined in the Subordinated Debentures before the change in GAAP. As of June 30, 2012, the Companys tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, was $15B and its total adjusted assets each as defined in the Subordinated Debentures, were $148B. As of June 30, 2012, the consolidated total assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet were $148B.
