# Denotes a variance of more than 100 percent

New York  October 17, 2012
American Express Company (NYSE: AXP)
today reported third-quarter net income of $1.3 billion, up 1 percent from a year ago.  Diluted earnings per share was $1.09, up 6 percent from $1.03 a year ago.
______________________________________
 
Income from discontinued operations primarily reflects the resolution of certain prior years tax items related to American Express Bank Ltd., which was sold to Standard Chartered PLC during Q108.

Represents income from continuing operations or net income, as applicable, less earnings allocated to participating share awards of $14 million and $15 million for the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and $42 million and $44 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Consolidated total revenues net of interest expense rose 4 percent to $7.9 billion in the third quarter, from $7.6 billion a year ago.  The increase was driven by a rise in cardmember spending and higher net interest income that reflected growth in the cardmember loan portfolio.
Adjusted for foreign currency translations, consolidated total revenues net of interest expense rose 5 percent from a year ago.
3
Consolidated provisions for losses totaled $479 million, up 92 percent from $249 million a year ago. This increase reflects substantially lower reserve releases than the year ago period, partially offset by lower net write-offs in the current quarter. Credit indicators continued to be at historically strong levels.
Consolidated expenses totaled $5.5 billion, down 2 percent from $5.6 billion last year. The decrease reflects lower salaries and employee benefits costs and lower rewards expenses.  Year ago expenses were reduced by the receipt of the Visa settlement totaling $70 million.
Adjusted for foreign currency translations, consolidated total expenses are down 1 percent from a year ago.
3
The effective tax rate was 33 percent, up from 28 percent in the year ago quarter.  The year ago tax rate reflected the realization of certain foreign tax credits.
 
The company's return on average equity (ROE) was 26.3 percent, down from 27.8 percent a year ago.
We generated solid results this quarter against the backdrop of a very uneven global economy, said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive officer.  Bottom line results were driven by higher revenues and lower expenses, a combination that reflects ongoing efforts to contain operating costs while maintaining a substantial level of investment in our marketing and rewards programs.
Cardmember spending rose 8 percent in the U.S. from a year ago and 6 percent globally (8 percent fx-adjusted). Thats a healthy pace in the current environment and an improvement from earlier in the quarter.  Nonetheless, it represents slower growth than we were generating earlier in the year, a trend that were seeing among major card issuers.
Credit quality remained at the historically strong levels, but we didnt have the same benefit from substantial reserve releases as last year when write-offs and delinquencies were declining at a faster rate.
We continue to see many growth opportunities as new technologies drive the migration of global payments from cash and checks towards plastic and digital transactions. We are strengthening traditional products that deliver value to cardmembers and drive business for merchants.  At the same time, we are also moving to broadening our franchise with the extension of our Loyalty Partner business into new markets like Mexico and the recently announced partnership with Walmart to reach new segments of the U.S. market that are looking for an alternative to traditional debit cards and checking accounts.
 
______________________________________ 
As reported in this release, FX adjusted information, which constitute non-GAAP financial measures, assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the three months ended September 30, 2012 apply to the period(s) against which such results are being compared). The company believes the presentation of information on an F/X adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare the company's performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

Taking full advantage of these and other opportunities, particularly in a slow growth economy, will continue to require rigorous cost containment to help ensure that we have the investment resources needed to continue to deliver on our growth objectives.

All information in the following tables is presented on a basis prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), unless otherwise indicated. The Company revised the income statement reporting of card fees on lending products in the first quarter of 2012, increasing Net card fees and reducing Interest on loans. Corresponding amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. This change does not impact Total revenues net of interest expense in the income statement, or the Net interest yield on cardmember loans, a non-GAAP measure.

(A)  Card billed business includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements (non-proprietary billed business), and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards.  In-store spend activity within retail co-brand portfolios in Global Network Services, from which the Company earns no revenue, is not included in non-proprietary billed business.  Card billed business is reflected in the United States or outside the United States based on where the cardmember is domiciled.
(B)  Total cards-in-force represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding.  Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner and does not include additional supplemental cards issued on that account.  Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force include basic and supplemental cards issued to employee cardmembers.  Non-proprietary cards-in-force includes all cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for retail co-brand cardmember accounts that have no out-of-store spend activity during the prior 12 month period.
(C)  This calculation is designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general purpose American Express cards.  It represents the percentage of billed business (both proprietary and Global Network Services) retained by the Company from merchants it acquires, prior to payments to third parties unrelated to merchant acceptance.
(D)  Average basic card member spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only. Average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force.  The adjusted average fee per card, which is a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs. The amount of amortization excluded was $65 million and $52 million for the quarters ended September  30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Company presents adjusted average fee per card because the Company believes this metric presents a useful indicator of card fees pricing across a range of its proprietary card products.

(D) For cardmember receivables, includes net write-offs for unauthorized transactions of $(37) million and $(46) million for the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively; foreign currency translation adjustments of $6 million and $(5) million for the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively; and other adjustments of $(1) million and $(4) million for the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. For cardmember loans, includes net write-offs for unauthorized transactions of $(31) million and $(29) million for the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively; foreign currency translation adjustments of $10 million and $(14) million for the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively; and other adjustments of $(3) million and $1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
(E)  The Company presents a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention.  In addition, because the Company's practice is to include uncollectible interest and/or fees as part of its total provision for losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented.
(F)  See Appendix III for calculations of net interest yield on cardmember loans, a non-GAAP measure, and net interest income divided by average loans, a GAAP measure, and the Company's rationale for presenting net interest yield on cardmember loans.

In-store spend activity within retail co-brand portfolios in Global Network Services, from which the Company earns no revenue, is not included in non-proprietary billed business.
(B) Segment capital represents capital allocated to a segment based upon specific business operational needs, risk measures, and regulatory capital requirements.
(C)
Refer to Appendix II for components of return on average segment capital and return on average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure.

(A) Return on average equity and return on average common equity are calculated by dividing one year period net income/net income attributable to common shareholders by one year average total shareholders equity/average common shareholders' equity, respectively.
 
(B) Return on average tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner as return on average common equity except the computation of average tangible common shareholders' equity, a non-GAAP measure, excludes from average total shareholders' equity, average goodwill and other intangibles. The Company believes that return on average tangible common equity is a useful measure of the profitability of its business.

(A) Return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing one year period segment income by one year average segment capital.  Return on average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, excludes average goodwill and other intangibles.  The Company believes that return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of its business.

(A)  Adjusted net interest income, a non-GAAP measure, represents net interest income allocated to the Company's cardmember loan portfolio excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to the Company's cardmember loan portfolio. The Company believes adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it is a component of net interest yield on cardmember loans.
 
 
   
(B)  Adjusted average loans, a non-GAAP measure, represents average cardmember loans excluding the impact of deferred card fees, net of deferred direct acquisition costs of cardmember loans, and other. The Company believes adjusted average loans is useful to investors because it is a component of net interest yield on cardmember loans.
 
(C)  This calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the cardmember loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on cardmember loans. The calculation includes interest income and interest expense attributable to investment securities and other interest-bearing deposits as well as to cardmember loans, and interest expense attributable to other activities, including cardmember receivables.
 
(D)  Net interest yield on cardmember loans, a non-GAAP measure, is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by adjusted average loans, computed on an annualized basis.  The calculation of net interest yield on cardmember loans includes interest that is deemed uncollectible. For all presentations of net interest yield on cardmember loans, reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses - cardmember loans; therefore, such reserves and net write-offs are not included in the net interest yield calculation. The Company believes net interest yield on cardmember loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of the Company's cardmember loan portfolio.

As reported in this Earnings Supplement, FX adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the three months ended September 30, 2012 apply to the period(s) against which such results are being compared).  The Company believes the presentation of information on an FX adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare the Companys performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

CAPITAL
The Company repurchased 17MM common shares at an average price of $57.69 in Q312 versus 26MM common shares in Q311. The Company is executing its share repurchase program, subject to market conditions, pursuant to its capital plan to repurchase up to $4.0B of common shares in 2012.
Year to date and since the inception of repurchase programs in December 1994, the Company has distributed 86% and 65% of capital generated through share repurchases and dividends on a cumulative basis, respectively.
:
Shares Outstanding
 
On June 7, 2012, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation issued three joint notices of proposed rulemaking text, collectively referred to as Basel III, which presents details of the new U.S. regulatory capital standards.  The Company estimates that had the new rules been in place, and were finalized as proposed, during Q312, the reported Tier 1 common and Tier 1 capital ratios would decline by approximately 20 basis points and the reported Tier 1 leverage ratio would decline by approximately 5 basis points, but would remain above expected regulatory thresholds, and the supplementary leverage ratio would have been approximately 9.1%.  These ratios are calculated using the standardized approach as described in the proposed rules and are based on the Companys reported Basel I ratios, without taking into account the potential impact of Basel II implementation. The Company is currently taking steps toward Basel II implementation in the United States.

These ratios represent a preliminary estimate as of the date of this Earnings Supplement and may be revised in the Companys Third Quarter 2012 Form 10-Q.

Tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, excludes goodwill and other intangibles of $4.2B from total shareholders equity of $19.5B.  The Company believes presenting the ratio of tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets is a useful measure of evaluating the strength of the Companys capital position.
 
17
Presented for the purpose of calculating the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio.
 
 The proposed capital ratios are non-GAAP measures. The Company believes the presentation of the proposed capital ratios is helpful to investors by showing the impact of Basel III, assuming the new rules as currently proposed are implemented by the Federal Reserve. The estimated impact of the Basel III rules will change over time based upon changes in the size and composition of the Companys balance sheet; and the estimated impact for the third quarter of 2012 is not necessarily indicative of the impact in future periods. Refer to Annex 2 for a reconciliation of the proposed capital ratios.

FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY
 
 
The total portfolio of U.S. retail Certificates of Deposit (CDs) issued through the direct deposit and third-party programs had a weighted average remaining maturity of 18.3 months and a weighted average rate at issuance of 2.1%.
On August 3, 2012, the Company extended its $3.0B committed, revolving, secured facility, from its original maturity date in December 2013, to July 15, 2014.  This secured financing facility gives the Company the right to sell up to $3.0B face amount of eligible AAA notes from the Charge Trust.
On October 3, 2012, the Company entered into a new three-year committed, revolving, secured financing facility that gives the Company the right to sell up to $2.0B face amount of eligible AAA certificates from the Lending Trust at any time with a repayment date of no later than September 15, 2015. The facility is sponsored by, and with a liquidity backup provided by, a syndicate of banks. The purchasers commitments to fund any unfunded amounts under this facility are subject to the terms and conditions of, among other things, a purchase agreement among certain subsidiaries, the note purchasers and certain other parties.  The borrowing cost of the facility includes a fixed facility fee. In addition the drawn balance incurs a weighted average cost of funds to the participating banks plus 25 bps.
Both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund seasonal working capital needs, as well as to further enhance the Companys contingent funding resources.

Supplemental Information  Tangible Common Equity and Total Adjusted Assets
During the third quarter of 2006, the Company issued $750MM of 6.80% Subordinated Debentures due 2036 (Subordinated Debentures), which are automatically extendable until 2066 unless certain events occur prior to that date. In connection with the Subordinated Debentures, the Company has undertaken to disclose on a quarterly basis the amount of its tangible common equity and total adjusted assets, as defined in the Subordinated Debentures. The Companys consolidated tangible common equity amount as of the end of any fiscal quarter means total shareholders equity, excluding preferred stock, of the Company as reflected on its consolidated balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP as of such fiscal quarter end minus (i) intangible assets and goodwill and (ii) deferred acquisition costs, as determined in accordance with GAAP and reflected in such consolidated balance sheet. The Companys total adjusted assets as of the end of any fiscal quarter is calculated as the sum of (i) total consolidated assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet minus (ii) non-securitized cardmember loan receivables (without deduction for reserves), which are set forth on the Companys balance sheet, plus (iii) managed (i.e., securitized and non-securitized) worldwide cardmember loan receivables as reported by the Company for such fiscal quarter.  Upon the adoption of new GAAP effective  January 1, 2010, the Companys total consolidated assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet now are the same amount as would be calculated as total adjusted assets as defined in the Subordinated Debentures before the change in GAAP.  As of September 30, 2012, the Companys tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, was $15B and its total adjusted assets each as defined in the Subordinated Debentures, were $153B.  As of September 30, 2012, the consolidated total assets as reflected on the Companys balance sheet were $153B.

The Tier 1 Common Risk-Based Capital Ratio is calculated as Tier 1 Common Equity, a non-GAAP measure, divided by Risk-weighted assets.  Tier 1 Common Equity is calculated by reference to Total Shareholders Equity as shown below:

The following table presents a comparison of the Companys Tier 1 and Tier 1 common risk-based capital under Basel I rules to its estimated Tier 1 and Tier 1 common risk-based capital under Basel III rules for purposes of calculating the estimated Tier 1 and Tier 1 common capital ratios and the supplementary leverage ratio.
