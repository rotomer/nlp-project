AUTOZONE SECOND QUARTER EPS UP 36% OVER PRIOR YEAR;
ROIC IMPROVES TO 21.4% ON A TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS BASIS
Memphis, Tenn. (March 4, 2003) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE: AZO), today reported sales of $1.121 billion for its second fiscal quarter (12 weeks) ended February 15, 2003, an increase of 3.6% from fiscal 2002.  Excluding the sales of the TruckPro subsidiary which was sold in December 2001 sales increased 4.8%.  Same store sales, or sales for domestic stores open at least one year, increased 2.4% during the quarter.  Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, for the quarter improved by 0.34 percentage points, while operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, declined by 1.62 percentage points.  This resulted in a 13.2% operating profit margin, up 1.96 percentage points from last year.  Net income for the quarter increased 24% to $79.3 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 36% to $0.79 from $0.58 reported in the year-ago quarter.  Return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters increased to 21.4%.
For the fiscal year-to-date period (24 weeks), sales were $2.339 billion, an increase of 3.6% from the previous year, with a same store sales increase of 3.5%.  Year-to-date net income increased 25% to $184.2 million, while diluted earnings per share for the period increased 37% to $1.83 from $1.34.  On a trailing four quarters basis, AutoZone has achieved a 5.8% same store sales increase, including 4.0% for retail and 22.8% for commercial.
"We are pleased with our strong performance through the second quarter, even as we anniversaried 12% same store sales increases from the prior year," said Steve Odland, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer.  "The 29% same store sales increase in our AZ Commercial business reflects our commercial customers' positive response to our efforts.  Additionally, we are excited about our new advertising initiatives.
"Our continued focus on controlling costs through relentless expense discipline continues to drive shareholder value.  Operating expenses as a percentage of sales declined 1.62 percentage points to 31.1% in the second quarter.  This rate is the lowest second quarter rate achieved since 1995.  Additionally, we maintained our inventory per store at levels not exceeding the first quarter while reducing net inventory per store versus the previous year.
"AutoZone believes in the highest level of integrity in its operations and financial reporting.  Among other things during 2000, we created a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee which is comprised of independent directors.  We restructured our Board of Directors, repealed our poison pill, and instituted a code of conduct.  I am proud to say that our efforts have been recognized recently by Institutional Shareholder Services.  Out of 5,000 companies assessed, ISS ranked AutoZone in the top ten in its overall Corporate Governance Quotient Research Tool.  This rating confirms that we are focused on the right things for instilling honest, clear decision making procedures in all our day-to-day activities."
Additionally, AutoZone, Inc. announced on January 29, 2003 that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $500 million of the company's common stock, in connection with the ongoing share repurchase program.  During the quarter, the company purchased 3.8 million shares for $259 million, including $178 million purchased under forward purchase contracts.  Since 1998, cumulative share repurchases under the share repurchase program were $2.39 billion, or 66.3 million shares at an average price of $36.08 per share, including $297.5 million, or 4.3 million shares, under forward purchase contracts. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the company purchased 1.5 million shares in settlement of certain forward contracts outstanding as of February 15, 2003, at an average cost of $64.92 per share.
