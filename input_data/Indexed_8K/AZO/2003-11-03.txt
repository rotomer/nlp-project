Item 5.        Other Events
        On November 3, 2003, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. ("Citigroup") issued a press release stating that ESL Investments, Inc. ("ESL") and Citigroup had agreed to modify the terms of the sale by partnerships associated with ESL of a portion of their interests in AutoZone, Inc. ("AutoZone"), which had been announced on October 31, 2003 (and was the subject of a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on October 31, 2003).  The press release stated that the ESL partnerships will continue to sell, as previously announced, approximately 5.6 million shares of AutoZone common stock in a public offering underwritten by Citigroup for a purchase price to be paid to the partnerships of approximately $550 million.  The press release stated that ESL and Citigroup have, however, decided not to proceed with the proposed sale by the ESL partnerships of an over-the-counter option providing for the purchase by an affiliate of Citigroup of 4.4 million shares of AutoZone common stock.  The press release further stated that, as a result of the decision regarding the proposed option, the affiliate of Citigroup will not offer, as previously announced, an additional 1.8 million AutoZone shares in transactions through Citigroup.
        As previously announced, AutoZone will not sell any shares in the offering.
