News:
For immediate release
Memphis, Tenn. (September 21, 2004)  AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE: AZO) today reported sales of $1.836 billion for its fourth fiscal quarter (16 weeks) ended August 28, 2004, an increase of 0.3% from fiscal 2003. Same store sales, or sales for domestic stores open at least one year, decreased 3% for the quarter. Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, for the quarter improved by 1.6 percentage points while operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased by 1.5 percentage points. This resulted in an operating margin of 19.8%, up 0.1 percentage points from last year. Operating profit increased 1.0% over the prior year.
Net income for the quarter increased by 0.9% over the same period last year to $209 million, and diluted earnings per share, reflecting net income and the benefit of the company share repurchase program, increased 11.2% to $2.53 per share from $2.27 per share reported in the year-ago quarter.
Return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters increased to 25.1% from 23.4% the previous year.
For the fiscal year ended August 28, 2004, sales were $5.637 billion, an increase of 3.3% from the prior year, while same store sales were flat. Operating profit increased 8.8% on an operating margin of 17.7%. Year-to-date net income increased 9.4% to $566 million, while diluted earnings per share for the period increased 22.8% to $6.56 from $5.34.
Under its ongoing share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 3.9 million shares of its common stock for $318 million during the fourth quarter. During the fiscal year ended August 28, 2004 share repurchases totaled $848 million, or 10.2 million shares at an average price of $83.20 per share.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 49.2% while operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 29.4%. AutoZone has adopted the accounting required by the Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 02-16, "Accounting by a Customer (including a Reseller) for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor" (EITF Issue 02-16), effective January 1, 2003. As a result, both this year's and last year's fourth quarters were affected by this change in classification. For the sixteen weeks ended August 28, 2004 and August 30, 2003, this resulted in a change in classification of vendor funding from operating expenses to cost of goods sold of $52.7 million and $37.0 million, respectively. Additionally, during this year's fourth quarter the Company experienced a gain from warranty negotiations of $15.5 million or $0.12 per share while last year's fourth quarter reflected a gain from warranty negotiations of $8.7 million or $0.06 per share as well as $4.6 million or $0.03 per share gain from the reversal of a restructuring reserve the Company established back in fiscal 2001 primarily for the closure of AutoZone stores. Excluding the impact of these events, gross margin for the quarter would have been 45.5% (versus 45.5% last year) and operating selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales would have been 26.5% (versus 26.1% last year). The opening of 84 new AutoZone stores and the Company's initiative to refresh 71 additional stores during the quarter contributed to the increase in operating selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales.
The Company reduced its gross inventory levels (the reported balance sheet inventory, which is total inventory less supplier owned Pay On Scan inventory) per store as of August 28, 2004, to $448 thousand from $462 thousand last year. Net inventory, defined as gross inventory less accounts payable, declined on
 
 
a per store level to $38 thousand from $46 thousand last year. As of August 28, 2004, the Company achieved $147 million in Pay On Scan inventory.
During the quarter ended August 28, 2004, AutoZone opened 77 new stores, closed 1 store, re-opened 7 stores under the AutoZone brand formerly operated as ABC Auto Parts, a regional auto parts chain, and replaced 2 stores in the U.S. while additionally opening 3 new stores in Mexico. As of August 28, 2004, the Company had 3,420 domestic stores and 63 stores in Mexico. AutoZone is the nation's leading retailer of automotive parts and accessories. Each store carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, and non-automotive products. Many domestic stores also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers and service stations. AutoZone also sells the ALLDATA brand diagnostic and repair software. On the web, AutoZone sells diagnostic and repair information and auto and light truck parts through www.autozone.com. AutoZone does not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation.
