Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On December 16, 2004, the stockholders of AutoZone, Inc. (the "Company") approved the AutoZone, Inc. 2005 Executive Incentive Compensation Plan ("Plan"), intended to qualify as a performance-based compensation plan under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company's executive officers are eligible to participate in the Plan. Pursuant to the Plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") establishes objective performance goals at the beginning of each fiscal year. After the end of each fiscal year, the Committee must certify the attainment of goals, if any, and direct the amount of bonus to be paid to each participant in cash. The Committee, in its discretion, may reduce or eliminate any bonus to be paid to an executive, even if a goal was attained. No participant may receive more than $4 million in any fiscal year as a bonus under the Plan.
The Committee has established performance goals for the 2005 fiscal year, the components of which are return on invested capital, and earnings before interest and taxes.
