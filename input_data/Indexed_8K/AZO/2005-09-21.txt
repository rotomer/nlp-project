Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
The following exhibit is furnished with this Current Report pursuant to Item 2.02: (c)       Exhibits             99.1     Press Release dated September 21, 2005
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Sept. 21, 2005 (PRIMEZONE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported sales of $1.882 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter (16 weeks) ended August 27, 2005, up 2.5% from fiscal fourth quarter 2004. Same store sales, or sales for domestic stores open at least one year, were down 1% for the quarter. Operating margin decreased 116 basis points from last year to 18.7%, while operating profit decreased 3.5% over the prior year.
Net income for the quarter decreased 1.3% over the same period last year to $206.6 million, while diluted earnings per share, reflecting net income and the benefit of the Company's share repurchase program, increased 5.4% to $2.66 per share from $2.53 per share reported in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 48.7% (versus 49.2% last year). Last year's gross margin reflected $15.5 million of pre-tax gain from warranty credits. On a comparable basis, gross profit, for the quarter, as a percentage of sales, was 48.7% versus 48.3% last year. The improvement in comparable gross margin was largely due to the Company's ongoing category management initiatives as well as reduced sales of non-core, lower-margin, merchandise. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 30.0% (versus 29.4% last year). The increase in operating expenses reflected efforts to improve the customer shopping experience, from expanding hours of operation to ensuring stores were properly merchandised and well presented. Excluding last year's warranty credit, operating profit was up 0.8%.
Additionally, for this year's quarter there was a discrete income tax benefit of $6 million. Therefore, on a comparable basis, diluted earnings per share increased 7.3% to $2.59 versus the year-ago quarter of $2.41.
Under its ongoing share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 1.3 million shares of its common stock for $118.3 million during the fourth quarter, at an average price of $93 per share. Since 1998 cumulative share repurchases have totaled $4.1 billion, or 87.0 million shares at an average price of $47 per share.
The Company's gross per store inventory level (the reported balance sheet inventory, which is total inventory less supplier owned pay-on-scan) as of August 27, 2005, was $453 thousand versus $448 thousand last year. Net inventory, defined as gross inventory less accounts payable, decreased on a per store level to $34 thousand from $38 thousand last year reflecting an increase in accounts payable to 92.5% of inventory from 91.5% of inventory in the prior year. The increase in gross inventory levels reflects the Company's efforts to invest in the right part at the right place to further enhance its industry-leading brand in the eyes of its customers.
"Our operating margin this quarter reflects actions we took to improve the in-store customer experience. We increased training, placed additional focus on improving the appearance of our stores, and we intensified efforts to drive our unique and powerful culture. We are encouraged by our customers' and AutoZoners' initial response to these new initiatives. We will maintain our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings and utilizing our capital effectively, while looking to leverage our industry-leading position," said Bill Rhodes, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter ended August 27, 2005, AutoZone opened 87 new stores and replaced 3 stores in the U.S. while additionally opening 8 new stores in Mexico. As of August 27, 2005, the Company had 3,592 domestic stores and 81 stores in Mexico.
