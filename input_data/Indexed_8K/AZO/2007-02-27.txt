EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Feb. 27, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $1.300 billion for its second quarter (12 weeks) ended February 10, 2007, up 3.7% from fiscal second quarter 2006. Same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, were down 0.3% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased 6.2% over the same period last year to $103.0 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 15.5% to $1.45 per share from $1.25 per share reported in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 49.2% (versus 49.1% last year). We experienced improvements in leveraging product acquisition costs offset by a shift in sales mix toward lower margin, seasonally related product. Additionally, operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 34.6% (versus 34.9% last year). The favorable variance in operating expenses was primarily due to our store reset efforts in last year's second quarter and an ongoing focus to reduce expenditures throughout the organization.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 1.0 million shares of its common stock for $128.9 million during the second quarter, at an average price of $123 per share. The Company virtually completed its remaining capacity under its previous share repurchase authorization, and today announces it has received approval from its Board of Directors to purchase an additional $500 million to take its cumulative repurchase program, begun in 1998, to $5.4 billion.
The Company's adjusted inventory per store, which includes supplier owned pay-on-scan inventory, as of February 10, 2007, was $496 thousand versus $494 thousand last year. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, decreased on a per store level to $63 thousand from $79 thousand last year.
"I'd like to congratulate our AutoZoners across the country for delivering record second quarter net income and earnings per share results. Although overall sales performance has been below our expectations, we were successful in leveraging our operating model to deliver 15.5% growth in earnings per share. We believe we are taking appropriate actions to improve our overall sales performance. We are pleased with the progress we have made regarding our new merchandise assortment initiatives and believe we are well positioned heading into our busiest selling season. As our operating model continues to be strong, we will maintain our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings and utilizing our capital effectively," said Bill Rhodes, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter ended February 10, 2007, AutoZone opened 34 new stores and replaced 5 stores in the U.S. Additionally, the Company re-opened 1 of the remaining 3 U.S. stores closed due to hurricane-related damage in last year's first quarter. As of February 10, 2007, the Company had 3,847 stores in 48 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 108 stores in Mexico.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include adjusted inventory, adjusted inventory per store, adjusted debt, adjusted debt/EBITDAR, and adjusted rent expense. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.
Certain statements contained in this press release are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy," and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation: competition; product demand; the economy; the ability to hire and retain qualified employees; consumer debt levels; inflation; weather; raw material costs of our suppliers; energy prices; war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity; availability of consumer trans portation; construction delays; access to available and feasible financing; and changes in laws or regulations. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results; developments and business decisions may differ from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, and such events could materially and adversely affect our business. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
