The following exhibit is furnished with this Current Report pursuant to Item 2.02: (d) Exhibits       99.1 Press Release dated September 18, 2007.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Sept. 18, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $2.0 billion for its fourth quarter (16 weeks) ended August 25, 2007, an increase of 3.3% from fiscal fourth quarter 2006. Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, decreased 0.2% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased 1.7% over the same period last year to $217.2 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 10.6% to $3.23 per share from $2.92 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 50.1% (versus 49.7% last year). The improvement in gross margin was due to ongoing category management efforts as well as supply chain efficiencies. Additionally, operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 31.3% (versus 30.4% last year). The increase in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, primarily reflected higher occupancy costs versus last year.
For the fiscal year ended August 25, 2007, sales were $6.2 billion, an increase of 3.7% from the prior year, while domestic same store sales were up 0.1%. Operating profit increased 4.5% on an operating margin of 17.1%. For fiscal 2007, net income increased 4.6% to $596 million, while diluted earnings per share for the period increased 13.6% to $8.53 from $7.50.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 2.3 million shares of its common stock for $297.4 million during the fourth quarter, at an average price of $132 per share. For the fiscal year, the Company repurchased 6.0 million shares of its common stock for $761.9 million, at an average price of $126 per share.
The Company's adjusted inventory per store, which includes supplier owned pay-on-scan inventory, as of August 25, 2007, was $500 thousand versus $501 thousand last year. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, decreased on a per store level to $34 thousand from $38 thousand last year.
"We are pleased to report record sales and earnings for our fourth quarter. While we experienced less sales traction from our ongoing initiatives than we had expected, our marketing research continues to tell us our service levels are improving, and that our customers are more inclined to return to our stores for their next purchase. As we begin our new fiscal year, we believe we are well positioned to generate increased sales growth for both our Retail and Commercial businesses. As our operating model continues to be strong, we will maintain our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings and utilizing our capital effectively," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter ended August 25, 2007, AutoZone opened 53 new stores, replaced three stores, and closed one store in the U.S. and opened 13 stores in Mexico. As of August 25, 2007, the Company had 3,933 stores in 48 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 123 stores in Mexico.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include adjusted inventory, adjusted inventory per store, adjusted debt, and adjusted debt/EBITDAR. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying recon ciliation tables.

Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy," and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation: competition; product demand; the economy; credit markets; the ability to hire and retain qualified employees; consumer debt levels; inflation; weather; raw material costs of our suppliers; energy prices; war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity; availability of consumer transportation; construction delays; access to available and feasible financing; and changes in laws or r egulations. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results; developments and business decisions may differ from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, and such events could materially and adversely affect our business.
