Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
The following exhibit is furnished with this Current Report pursuant to Item 2.02: (d)   Exhibits        99.1 Press Release dated December 4, 2007.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Dec. 4, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $1.5 billion for its first quarter (12 weeks) ended November 17, 2007, an increase of 4.5% from fiscal first quarter 2007. Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, increased 1.3% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased 7.0% over the same period last year to $132.5 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 17.4% to $2.02 per share from $1.73 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 49.9% (versus 49.2% last year). The improvement in gross margin was due to ongoing category management efforts as well as a shift in sales mix to higher margin categories. Additionally, operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 33.6% (versus 33.2% last year). The increase in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, primarily reflected higher occupancy costs versus last year.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 2.9 million shares of its common stock for $350.0 million during the first quarter, at an average price of $121 per share. The Company has $108 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.
The Company's GAAP inventory increased 8.9% over the same period last year. However, adjusted inventory per store, which includes supplier owned pay-on-scan inventory, as of November 17, 2007, was $507 thousand versus $503 thousand last year, an increase of less than 1%. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, decreased on a per store basis to $50 thousand from $60 thousand last year.
"We were pleased to report record sales and earnings performance for this quarter, as we continued to build momentum with our ongoing efforts to improve the customer shopping experience. With the support of all our AutoZoners, we were able to drive sales increases across each of our strategic priorities: Domestic Retail, Domestic Commercial, Mexico and ALLDATA. As our operating model continues to be strong, we will maintain our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings and utilizing our capital effectively," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter ended November 17, 2007, AutoZone opened 40 new stores, replaced three stores, and closed one store in the U.S. and opened one store in Mexico. As of November 17, 2007, the Company had 3,972 stores in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 124 stores in Mexico.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include adjusted inventory, adjusted inventory per store, adjusted debt, and adjusted debt/EBITDAR. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying recon ciliation tables.

Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy," and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation: competition; product demand; the economy; credit markets; the ability to hire and retain qualified employees; consumer debt levels; inflation; weather; raw material costs of our suppliers; energy prices; war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity; availability of consumer transportation; construction delays; access to available and feasible financing; and changes in laws or r egulations. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results; developments and business decisions may differ from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, and such events could materially and adversely affect our business.
