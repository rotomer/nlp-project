The following exhibit is furnished with this Current Report pursuant to Item 2.02: (d)         Exhibits               99.1    Press Release dated February 26, 2008.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Feb. 26, 2008 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $1.3 billion for its second quarter (12 weeks) ended February 9, 2008, an increase of 3.0% from fiscal second quarter 2007. Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, decreased 0.3% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased 3.6% over the same period last year to $106.7 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 15.7% to $1.67 per share from $1.45 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 49.9% (versus 49.2% last year). The improvement in gross margin was primarily due to ongoing category management efforts. Additionally, operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 35.2% (versus 34.6% last year). The increase in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, primarily reflected higher occupancy costs versus the previous year.
The Company's GAAP inventory increased 8.2% over the same period last year. However, adjusted inventory per store, which includes supplier owned pay-on-scan inventory, as of February 9, 2008, was $504 thousand versus $496 thousand last year, an increase of 1.6%. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, decreased on a per store basis to $55 thousand from $63 thousand last year.
AutoZone did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during the second quarter. The Company has $108 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization. For the fiscal year-to-date, the Company has repurchased 2.9 million shares of its common stock for $350 million.
"I would like to thank our AutoZoners for delivering another quarter of record earnings, and, most importantly, for their ongoing commitment to delivering exceptional customer service. For the second quarter, we delivered EBIT growth in excess of four percent and our earnings per share again grew in excess of 15%. During the quarter, we experienced some deceleration in sales trends from the first fiscal quarter, however, we remain optimistic in our outlook for the future. Additionally, as our operating model continues to be strong, we will maintain our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings and utilizing our capital effectively," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter ended February 9, 2008, AutoZone opened 28 new stores and replaced two stores in the U.S. and opened four stores in Mexico. As of February 9, 2008, the Company had 4,000 stores in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 128 stores in Mexico.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include adjusted inventory, adjusted inventory per store, adjusted debt, and adjusted debt/EBITDAR. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying recon ciliation tables.
