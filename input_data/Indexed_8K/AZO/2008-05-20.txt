Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
The following exhibit is furnished with this Current Report pursuant to Item 2.02: (d)        Exhibits              99.1     Press Release dated May 20, 2008.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., May 20, 2008 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $1.5 billion for its third quarter (12 weeks) ended May 3, 2008, an increase of 3.0% from fiscal third quarter 2007. Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, decreased 0.3% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased 4.6% over the same period last year to $158.6 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 14.7% to $2.49 per share from $2.17 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 50.2% (versus 49.9% last year). The improvement in gross margin was primarily due to ongoing category management efforts and supply chain efficiencies, which were partially offset by higher shrink expense. Additionally, operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 32.2% (versus 31.9% last year). Higher occupancy costs versus last year were the primary contributor to the increase in comparable operating expenses.
The Company's GAAP inventory increased 6.4% over the same period last year. However, adjusted inventory per store, which includes supplier owned pay-on-scan inventory, as of May 3, 2008, was $508 thousand versus $504 thousand last year, an increase of 0.8%. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, decreased on a per store basis to $56 thousand from $73 thousand last year.
AutoZone did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during the third quarter. The Company has $108 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization. For the fiscal year-to-date, the Company has repurchased 2.9 million shares of its common stock for $350 million.
"I would like to thank all our AutoZoners across North America for their ongoing commitment to delivering exceptional customer service. Through their efforts, we were able to deliver our seventh consecutive quarter of double digit earnings per share growth, despite a challenging macro environment that included record high gas prices. We continue to refine our retail offering as evidenced by our improved customer satisfaction survey results, and our efforts to enhance our commercial offerings were rewarded by the highest quarterly commercial sales growth since our third quarter of fiscal 2004. As our operating model remains strong, we will maintain our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings and utilizing our capital effectively," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter ended May 3, 2008, AutoZone opened 32 new stores and replaced three stores in the U.S. and opened two stores in Mexico. As of May 3, 2008, the Company had 4,032 stores in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 130 stores in Mexico.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include return on invested capital, adjusted inventory, adjusted inventory per store, adjusted debt, and adjusted debt/EBITDAR. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.

Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy," and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate.
