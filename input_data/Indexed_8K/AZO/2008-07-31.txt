The Company will promptly effect the filings required under Rule 424(b), in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b) (without reliance on Rule 424(b)(8)), and will take such steps as it deems necessary to ascertain promptly whether the Prospectus transmitted for filing under Rule 424 was received for filing by the Commission and, in the event that it was not, it will promptly file the Prospectus. The Company will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment.
     (b) . The Company will give the Representative notice of its intention to file or prepare any amendment to the Registration Statement or any new registration statement relating to the Securities or any amendment, supplement or revision to either any preliminary prospectus (including any prospectus included in the Registration Statement or amendment thereto) at the time it became effective or to the Prospectus, whether pursuant to the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or otherwise, and the Company will furnish the Representative with copies of any such documents a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing or use, as the case may be, and will not file or use any such document to which the Representative or counsel to the Underwriters shall reasonably object.

The Company will prepare a final term sheet (the "Final Term Sheet") reflecting the final terms of the Securities, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representative and substantially in the form of Schedule II hereto, and shall file such Final Term Sheet as an "issuer free writing prospectus" pursuant to Rule 433; provided that the Company shall furnish the Representative with copies of any such Final Term Sheet a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing and will not use or file any such document to which the Representative or counsel to the Underwriters shall reasonably object. To the extent the distribution of Securities has been completed, the Company will not be required to provide the Representative with reports it is required to file with the Commission under the 1934 Act.
Filing of Amendments and Exchange Act Documents; Preparation of Final Term Sheet
     (c) . The Company has furnished or will deliver to the Representative and counsel to the Underwriters, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein or otherwise deemed to be part thereof) and signed copies of all consents and certificates of experts, and will also deliver to the Representative, without charge, a conformed copy of the Registration Statement and of each amendment thereto (without exhibits) for each of the Underwriters.

reasonably request, and the Company hereby consents to the use of such copies for purposes permitted by the 1933 Act. The Company will furnish to each Underwriter, without charge, during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, such number of copies of the Prospectus as such Underwriter may reasonably request. The Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto furnished to the Underwriters will be identical to any electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T.
     (e) . The Company will comply with the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations and the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations so as to permit the completion of the distribution of the Securities as contemplated in this Agreement and in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. If at any time when the Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Securities, any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the reasonable opinion of outside counsel to the Underwriters or for the Company, to amend the Registration Statement in order that the Registration Statement will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be necessary, in the reasonable opinion of such outside counsel, at any such time to amend the Registration Statement, to file a new registration statement, or to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations, the Company will (i) promptly prepare and file with the Commission, subject to Section 3(b), such amendment, supplement or new registration statement as may be necessary to correct such statement or omission or to comply with such requirements, (ii) use its best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable (if it is not an automatic shelf registration statement with respect to the Securities), and (iii) furnish to the Underwriters, without charge, such number of copies of such amendment, supplement or new registration statement as the Underwriters may reasonably request. If at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement (or any other registration statement relating to the Securities) or the Statutory Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus or included or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances prevailing at that subsequent time, not misleading, the Company will promptly notify the Representative and will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict, untrue statement or omission.
Continued Compliance with Securities Laws
     (f) . The Company will use its reasonable best efforts, in cooperation with the Underwriters, to qualify the Securities for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions (domestic or foreign) as the Representative may designate and to maintain such qualifications in effect for a period of not less than one year from the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign

Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Company and the Representative is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company represents that it has treated or agrees that it will treat each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, and has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission where required, legending and record keeping.

extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representative, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     (d) . If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested in writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid written request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such written request prior to the date of such settlement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested in writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (x) such indemnifying party reimburses such indemnified party in accordance with such request to the extent it considers such request to be reasonable; and (y) such indemnifying party provides written notice to the indemnified party substantiating the unpaid balance as unreasonable, in each case prior to the date of such settlement.
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
          SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation
Contribution
 
provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
     The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus.
     The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the number or aggregate
 
principal amount, as the case may be, of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I, and not joint.
               SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery
          SECTION 9. .

     (a) . The Representative may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the Closing Time if (i) there has been, since the time of execution of this Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the General Disclosure Package, (1) any material adverse change in the financial condition, earnings, management or business of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (2) any development involving a prospective material adverse change in or affecting the financial condition, earnings, management or business of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the General Disclosure Package, in any case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representative, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (ii) there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or, if the Securities include Securities denominated or payable in, or indexed to, one or more foreign or composite currencies, in the international financial markets, or any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or a declaration of a national emergency or war by the United States or other calamity or crisis or any material adverse change or development involving a prospective material adverse change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representative, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (iii) trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or trading generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter market has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by such exchange or by such market or by order of the Commission, the FINRA or any other governmental authority, or (iv) a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal or New York authorities or, if the Securities include Securities denominated or payable in, or indexed to, one or more foreign or composite currencies, by the relevant authorities in the related foreign country or countries or a material disruption shall have occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States.
Underwriting Agreement
     (b) . If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 9, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that Sections 1, 6, 7, 8 and 15 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.

Default by One or More of the Underwriters
     (a) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Securities to be purchased hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or
     (b) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Securities to be purchased hereunder, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
     No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
     In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representative or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.
          SECTION 11. . All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication.

Underwriting Agreement
     As such counsel, we have examined such matters of fact and questions of law as we have considered appropriate for purposes of this letter, except where a specific fact confirmation procedure is stated to have been performed (in which case we have with your consent performed the stated procedure). We have examined, among other things, the following:
 
     As to facts material to the opinions, statements and assumptions expressed herein, we have, with your consent, relied upon oral or written statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and others, including the representations and warranties of the Company in the Underwriting Agreement. We have not independently verified such factual matters.
     We are opining herein as to the effect on the subject transaction only of the federal laws of the United States and the internal laws of the State of New York, and we express no opinion with respect to the applicability thereto, or the effect thereon, of the laws of any other jurisdiction or as to any matters of municipal law or the laws of any local agencies within any state. Various matters concerning the laws of the State of Nevada are addressed in the opinion of Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, LLP, and various matters concerning the Company are addressed in the opinion of Harry L. Goldsmith, Esq., Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, each of which have been separately provided to you, and we express no opinion with respect to those matters. Our opinions set forth herein are based upon our consideration of only those statutes, rules and regulations which, in our experience, are normally applicable to underwritten public offerings of debt securities, provided that no opinion is expressed herein with respect to federal securities laws (except to the extent stated in paragraphs 4, 6 and 7), state securities laws, tax laws, antitrust or trade regulation laws, insolvency or fraudulent transfer laws or antifraud laws.
     Subject to the foregoing and the other matters set forth herein, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof:
1. The Indenture is the valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
2. The Notes, when executed, issued and authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by you in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms and entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
 
3. The execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement, the issuance and delivery of the Notes by the Company to you and the other Underwriters pursuant to the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement and performance by the Company of the Indenture and the Notes on the date hereof do not:
4. The Registration Statement is an automatic shelf registration statement that became effective under the Act upon filing with the Commission. Based solely on a telephonic confirmation by a member of the Staff of the Commission on August 4, 2008, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued under the Act and no proceedings therefor have been initiated by the Commission. Any required filing of the Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act has been made in accordance with Rule 424 under the Act.
5. The Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "").
TIA
6. The Registration Statement, as of the date it was declared effective, and the Prospectus, as of its dates, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements for registration statements on Form S-3 under the Act, the TIA, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; it being understood, however, that we express no opinion with respect to Regulation S-T or the financial statements or other financial data, included in, incorporated by reference in, or omitted from, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1. In passing upon the compliance as to form of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, we have assumed that the statements made therein are correct and complete.
7. Each of the Incorporated Documents, as of its respective filing or effective date, complied as to form in all material respects with the respective applicable requirements for reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K, and for proxy statements under Regulation 14A, as the case may be, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; it being understood, however, that we express no opinion with respect to Regulation S-T or the financial statements or other financial data, included in, incorporated by reference in, or omitted from such reports or proxy statements. In passing upon the compliance as to form of the Incorporated Documents, we have assumed that the statements made therein are correct and complete.
 
8. The statements in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Notes" and "Description of Debt Securities," insofar as they purport to describe or summarize certain provisions of the Notes or the Indenture, are accurate summaries or descriptions in all material respects.
9. Based solely on a certificate of an officer of the Company as to factual matters, the Company is not, and immediately after giving effect to the sale of the Notes in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement and the application of the proceeds as described in the Prospectus under the caption "Use of Proceeds," will not be required to be registered as an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
     In rendering the opinions in clause (a) of paragraph 3 above insofar as they require interpretation of the Material Agreements, with your consent, (i) we have assumed that courts of competent jurisdiction would enforce such agreements in accordance with their plain meaning, (ii) to the extent that any questions of legality or legal construction have arisen in connection with our review, we have applied the laws of the State of New York in resolving such questions, (iii) we express no opinion with respect to the effect of any action or inaction (other than the issuance and delivery of the Notes pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture and performance of the Indenture and the Notes on the date hereof) by the Company under the Material Agreements that may result in a breach or default under any Material Agreement, and (iv) we express no opinion with respect to any matters which would require us to perform a mathematical calculation or make a financial or accounting determination. Because certain of the Material Agreements may be governed by other than New York law, this opinion may not be relied upon as to whether a breach or default would occur under the law actually governing such Material Agreements.
     The opinions rendered in paragraphs 1 and 2 above relating to the enforceability of the Indenture and the Notes, respectively, are subject to the following exceptions, limitations and qualifications: (i) the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors; (ii) the effect of general principles of equity, whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law (including the possible unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief), including without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought; (iii) the unenforceability under certain circumstances under law or court decisions of provisions providing for the indemnification of or contribution to a party with respect to a liability where such indemnification or contribution is contrary to public policy; (iv) we express no opinion concerning the enforceability of the waiver of rights or defenses contained in Section 5.6 of the Indenture; (v) the unenforceability of any provision requiring the payment of attorneys' fees, where such payment is contrary to law or public policy; and (vi) we express no opinion with respect to whether an acceleration of the Notes may affect the collectibility of that portion of the stated principal amount thereof in excess of the public offering price ([___]% of the principal amount per Note) to the extent that such portion were determined to constitute unearned interest thereon.
 
     With your consent, we have assumed for purposes of this opinion that (i) each of the Company and the Trustee is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization; (ii) each of the Company and the Trustee has the requisite power and authority to execute and deliver and to perform its obligations under each of the Indenture and the Notes; (iii) each of the Company and the Trustee has duly authorized, executed and delivered each of the Indenture and the Notes (except that no such assumption is made with respect to execution and delivery thereof by the Company under the laws of the State of New York); (iv) each of the Indenture and the Notes constitutes a legally valid and binding agreement of the Trustee, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms; and (v) the Trustee is in compliance, generally and with respect to acting as Trustee under the Indenture, with all applicable laws and regulations. We express no opinion as to any state or federal laws or regulations applicable to the subject transaction because of the nature or extent of the business of any parties (other than the Company or its Subsidiaries) to the Indenture, the Notes or the Underwriting Agreement.
     This letter is furnished only to you in your capacity as representatives of the several Underwriters in their capacity as underwriters under the Underwriting Agreement and is solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in connection with the transactions covered hereby. This letter may not be relied upon by you or them for any other purpose, or furnished to, assigned to, quoted to, or relied upon by any other person, firm or other entity for any purpose (including any person, firm or other entity that acquires the Notes from you or the other Underwriters) without our prior written consent, which may be granted or withheld in our sole discretion. Our opinion is rendered as of the date hereof and we assume no obligation to advise you of changes in law or fact (or the effect thereof on the opinions expressed herein) that hereafter may come to our attention.

As representative of the several Underwriters

Exhibit A
     All capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Underwriting Agreement.
     I, or attorneys under my supervision, have made such legal and factual examinations and inquiries as I have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of this opinion. In my examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents
 
submitted to me as originals, and the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to me as copies. As to facts material to the opinions, statements and assumptions expressed herein, I have, with your consent, relied upon oral or written statements and representations of attorneys under my direction, officers and other representatives of the Company and others. In addition, I have obtained and relied upon such certificates and assurances from public officials as I have deemed necessary.
     Whenever a statement herein is qualified as to knowledge, awareness, or a similar phrase, it is intended to indicate that I do not, nor any attorney under my supervision, have current actual knowledge of the inaccuracy of such statement.
     Subject to the foregoing and the other matters set forth herein, it is my opinion that, as of the date hereof:
     (1) The Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure to so qualify or be in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect.
     (2) Each Subsidiary has been duly organized and is validly existing as a corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has corporate, limited liability company or partnership power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure to so qualify or be in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect. Except as otherwise stated in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, all of the issued and outstanding capital stock or partnership or equity interest of each Subsidiary has been duly authorized and is validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and, to the best of my knowledge, is owned by the Company, directly or through subsidiaries (with the exception of the preferred stock of AutoZone Development Corporation of which the Company owns, directly and indirectly, 1,086 shares and others own 114 shares), free and clear of any security interest, mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance, claim or equity. None of the outstanding shares of capital stock or partnership interest of any Subsidiary was issued in violation of preemptive or other similar rights of any securityholder of such Subsidiary.
     (3) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
     (4) The Indenture dated as of August 8, 2003 (as supplemented by the officers' certificates dated as of August 4, 2008, the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, N.A. has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
 
     (5) To the best of my knowledge, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of its charter or bylaws and no default by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries exists in the due performance or observance of any material obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other agreement or instrument that is described or referred to in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or filed or incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Registration Statement.
     (6) The execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, the issuance and sale of the Notes and the use of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes as described in the Prospectus under the caption "Use of Proceeds" and compliance by the Company with its obligations thereunder do not and will not, whether with or without the giving of notice or passage of time or both, (i) conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default or repayment event under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any assets, properties or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any contract, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan or credit agreement, note, lease or any other agreement or instrument, known to me, to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of them may be bound, or to which any of the assets, properties or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, (ii) result in any violation of the provisions of the charter or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) result in any violation of any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree, known to me, of any government, government instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their assets, properties or operations, except in the case of clauses (i) or (iii) for such conflicts, creations, impositions or violations as would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect.
     (7) To the best of my knowledge, except as disclosed in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there is not pending or threatened any action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or to which the assets, properties or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, before or by any court or governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign, which would reasonably be expected to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect or which would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture or the Notes or the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder.
     (8) All descriptions in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus of contracts and other documents to which the Company or its Subsidiaries are a party are accurate in all material respects. To the best of my knowledge, there are no franchises, contracts, indentures, mortgages, loan agreements, notes, leases or other instruments required to be described or referred to in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement other than those described or referred to therein or filed or incorporated by reference as exhibits thereto, and the descriptions thereof or references thereto are correct in all material respects.
 
     (9) To the best of my knowledge, there are no statutes or regulations that are required to be described in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus that are not described as required.
     My opinion herein is limited to the effect on the subject transaction of the laws of the State of Tennessee. I assume no responsibility regarding the applicability to, or the effect thereon, of the laws of any other jurisdiction or as to any matters of municipal law or the laws of any local agencies within any state, and I express no opinion herein concerning any federal law, including any federal securities law (except to the extent set forth in paragraphs 8 and 9 herein and except for the statement set forth in the penultimate paragraph hereof), or any state securities law. My opinions set forth in paragraph 6 above are based upon my consideration of only those statutes, rules and regulations which, in my experience, are normally applicable to underwritten public offerings of debt securities. In rendering the opinion in paragraph 8 as to the description in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus of contracts and other documents to which the Company or its Subsidiaries are a party (the "Opinion Documents"), I have assumed that Tennessee internal law governs the Opinion Documents and I express no opinion concerning the enforceability of any choice of law provisions in the Opinion Documents under any law. Finally, I have not independently verified and I assume no responsibility for differences which may exist between Tennessee law and the law of any other jurisdiction which may govern the Opinion Documents, or the extent to which any such differences may impact adversely the validity, binding effect or enforceability of the Opinion Documents.
     This letter is furnished only to you in your capacity as representatives of the several Underwriters in their capacity as underwriters under the Underwriting Agreement and is solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in connection with the transactions covered hereby. This letter may not be relied upon by you or them for any other purpose, or furnished to, assigned to, quoted to, or relied upon by any other person, firm or other entity for any purpose (including any person, firm or other entity that acquires the Notes from you or the other Underwriters) without my prior written consent, which may be granted or withheld in my sole discretion.
Very truly yours,
