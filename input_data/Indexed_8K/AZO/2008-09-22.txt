EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Sept. 19, 2008 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $2.2 billion for its fourth quarter (17 weeks) ended August 30, 2008, an increase of 10.4% from fiscal fourth quarter 2007 (16 weeks). Excluding sales from the additional week included in this year's quarter, sales were up 4.1%. Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, increased 0.6% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased 12.2% over the same period last year to $243.7 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 20.1% to $3.88 per share from $3.23 per share in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the additional week, net income for the quarter increased 5.0% over the previous year's quarter to $227.9 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 12.4% to $3.63 per share.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 50.3% (versus 50.1% last year). The improvement in gross margin was positively impacted by category management efforts, partially offset by higher shrink expense and increased distribution expense relating to higher fuel costs. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 31.4% (versus 31.3% last year). The increase in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, was primarily due to higher employee medical expense and fuel expense for our commercial fleet.
For the fiscal year ended August 30, 2008, sales were $6.5 billion, an increase of 5.7% from the prior year, while domestic same store sales were up 0.4%. Operating profit increased 6.5% on an operating margin of 17.2%. For fiscal 2008, net income increased 7.7% to $642 million, while diluted earnings per share for the period increased 17.8% to $10.04 from $8.53. Excluding results from the additional week, sales increased 3.7% from the prior year, and operating profit increased 4.0% on an operating margin of 17.1%. Net income, excluding the extra week, increased 5.1% to $626 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 14.9% to $9.80.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 3.9 million shares of its common stock for $499 million during the fourth quarter, at an average price of $128 per share. For the fiscal year, the Company repurchased 6.8 million shares of its common stock for $849 million, at an average price of $125 per share.
The Company's GAAP inventory increased 7.1% over the same period last year. However, adjusted inventory per store, which includes supplier owned pay-on-scan inventory, was $509 thousand versus $500 thousand last year, an increase of 1.6%. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, decreased on a per store basis to $25 thousand from $34 thousand last year.
"I would like to thank our entire organization for the solid performance delivered this past quarter. We are pleased to report our eighth consecutive quarter of double digit earnings per share growth, particularly in light of the challenging macro environment. For the year, we reached many new milestones which included exceeding $6.5 billion in sales. We also improved our return on invested capital, achieving 24.0% at year end. While our same store sales performance accelerated slightly from last quarter, it did not meet our aspirations. We continue to believe we have the right plans in place and we will continue to focus intensely on executing our plans. We will maintain our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings and utilizing our capital effectively," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter AutoZone opened 60 new stores and replaced six stores in the U.S. and opened 18 stores in Mexico. As of August 30, 2008, the Company had 4,092 stores in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 148 stores in Mexico.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include return on invested capital, adjusted inventory, adjusted inventory per store, adjusted debt, adjusted debt/EBITDAR, and adjusted consolidated statements of operations. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of thi s additional information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.

These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate.
