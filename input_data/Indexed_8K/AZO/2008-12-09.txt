EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Dec. 8, 2008 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $1.5 billion for its first quarter (12 weeks) ended November 22, 2008, an increase of 1.6 % from fiscal first quarter 2008 (12 weeks). Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, decreased 1.5% for the quarter.
Operating income for the quarter increased $1.2 million, or 0.5%, over the same period last year to $238.5 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 10.1% to $2.23 per share from $2.02 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 50.1% (versus 49.9% last year). The improvement in gross margin was positively impacted by category management efforts. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 34.0% (versus 33.6% last year). The increase in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, primarily reflected higher occupancy costs and self insurance expenses versus last year.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 2.2 million shares of its common stock for $272 million during the first quarter, at an average price of $122 per share. The Company has $337 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.
The Company's GAAP inventory increased 6.6% over the same period last year. However, adjusted inventory per store, which includes supplier owned pay-on-scan inventory, was $513 thousand versus $507 thousand last year, an increase of 1.3%. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, decreased on a per store basis to $43 thousand from $50 thousand last year.
"We are pleased to report our ninth consecutive quarter of double digit earnings per share growth. In this challenging macro economic environment, growing operating income is difficult, but through the dedication and commitment of our 57,000+ AutoZoners across North America, we were able to accomplish this goal. We were disappointed with our sales performance early in the quarter, as we were impacted by the disruption caused by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Beginning in October, our sales were more consistent with recent quarterly performance. Despite the challenges in the broader economy, we remain committed to our long range plans and believe the ultimate determinant of our success will be our strategies and our execution of those strategies. At the end of the first quarter, our balance sheet was in excellent condition, and we remain committed to our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings while utilizing our capital effectively," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter AutoZone opened 30 new stores and replaced two stores in the U.S. and opened two stores in Mexico. As of November 22, 2008, the Company had 4,122 stores in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 150 stores in Mexico.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include return on invested capital, adjusted inventory, adjusted inventory per store, adjusted debt, adjusted debt/EBITDAR, and adjusted consolidated statements of operations. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of thi s additional information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.

Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy," and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation: competition; product demand; the economy; credit markets; the ability to hire and retain qualified employees; consumer debt levels; inflation; weather; raw material costs of our suppliers; energy prices; war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity; availability of consumer transportation; construction delays; access to available and feasible financing; and changes in laws or r egulations. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results; developments and business decisions may differ from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, and such events could materially and adversely affect our business.
