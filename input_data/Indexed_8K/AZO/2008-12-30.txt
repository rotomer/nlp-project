On December 29, 2008, AutoZone, Inc. (the Company) executed certain amendments to the existing employment agreements between the Company and (a) Harry L. Goldsmith, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary dated as of August 31, 1999, and (b) Robert D. Olsen, Executive Vice President, Store Operations, Commercial and Mexico dated November 9, 2000 (collectively, the Employment Agreements), to bring the Employment Agreements into compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Section 409A).
Prior to the amendments, the Employment Agreements provided, among other things, that if the Company terminated the agreements without cause, the executive would remain an employee of the Company on leave of absence during a defined Continuation Period and would continue to receive his then-current salary and other benefits of an employee, a prorated bonus for the fiscal year in which he was terminated, and his stock options would continue to vest and could be exercised in accordance with the respective stock option agreements until the end of the Continuation Period, after which further stock option exercises and vesting would be governed by the terms of the respective stock option agreements.
As amended, the Employment Agreements provide that the executives employment status will end if the Companys termination of the agreements without cause results in a separation from service as defined in Section 409A, and the executive will receive severance benefits which are substantially similar to those provided under the original Employment Agreements, but which will be delivered in a manner that is compliant with Section 409A.
The above summary of the amendments to the Employment Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual amended and restated Employment Agreements, which are included as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively, of this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

If the Employee experiences a separation from service (within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)) () due to the Employees termination by AutoZone without Cause then AutoZone shall promptly pay or provide to the Employee:
Separation from Service
(i) Subject to Paragraph 16(c) below, three (3) years of the Employees then-current Base Salary, payable in substantially equal installments over the three (3) year period following the date of such Separation from Service (the ) (such three-year period after the Termination Date, the ) in accordance with AutoZones regular payroll practice, which amounts shall be payable on each payroll date on which AutoZone pays salary payments to its officers, beginning with the first such payroll date after the Termination Date (the ), and any amounts that would otherwise have been paid pursuant to this Paragraph 8(a)(i) prior to such payroll date shall be paid in a lump-sum on the First Payroll Date;
Termination Date

First Payroll Date
 
(ii) To the extent that the Employee has unvested stock options that would have otherwise vested during the Continuation Period had Employee not experienced a Separation from Service (the ), the vesting of such Subject Stock Options shall accelerate and such Subject Stock Options shall become fully vested on the Termination Date. The Subject Stock Options and all other stock options held by the Employee that vested on or before the Termination Date may be exercised in the manner set forth in the respective stock option agreements until the earlier of the 30 days following the end of the Continuation Period or the maximum term of the respective stock option agreement, without regard to any possible early expiration resulting from the Employees termination of employment. Notwithstanding, the Employees termination of employment pursuant to this paragraph shall not be considered a Termination of Employment pursuant to any stock option agreement for any stock option that would vest during the Continuation Period to cause such stock option to terminate;
Subject Stock Options
(iii) Continuation of medical, dental and vision benefit coverage under a group health plan of AutoZone for the benefit of the Employee and/or the Employees dependents, for the period beginning on the Termination Date and equal to the sum of (1) the Continuation Period and (2) the period during which the Employee was entitled to elect COBRA coverage as of the Termination Date, initially pursuant to Employees COBRA election until the expiration of the maximum COBRA period applicable to Employee;
(iv) Pay to the Employee a lump-sum amount equal, as determined by AutoZone, to three times the total aggregate annual COBRA premium costs for group medical, dental and vision benefit coverage for the Employee and the Employees spouse and dependents, in each case, as in effect with respect to each such individual immediately prior to such Separation from Service, which lump-sum payment shall be made six (6) months after the Termination Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the payment described in this Paragraph 8(a)(iv) shall be subject to withholding of any federal, state, local or foreign withholding or other taxes or charges which AutoZone is required to withhold; and
(v) During the Continuation Period, Employee shall not earn any bonus payments. AutoZone shall pay Employee a prorated bonus for the fiscal year which includes the Termination Date calculated based on the period of time elapsed during such fiscal year until the Termination Date and the formula established by the Compensation Committee for officers for that fiscal year. Said bonus shall be paid when other officer bonuses are paid for that fiscal year, but in no event later than the fifteenth day of the third month following the end of such fiscal year.
AutoZone shall have no obligations other than those stated herein upon the termination of this Agreement and Employee hereby releases AutoZone from any and all obligations and claims except those as are specifically set forth herein. Each payment under this Paragraph 8(a) shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A (as defined below). To the extent that any reimbursement is received or to be received by Employee, such reimbursements shall be administered consistent with the following additional requirements as set forth in Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv): (1) Employees eligibility for benefits in one taxable year will not affect Employees eligibility for benefits in any other taxable year, (2) any reimbursement of eligible expenses will be made on or before the last day of the taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense was incurred, and (3) Employees right to benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.
 
(b) WITH CAUSE. AutoZone shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and Employees employment with AutoZone for Cause at any time. Upon such termination for Cause, Employee shall have no right to receive any compensation, salary, or bonus and shall immediately cease to receive any benefits (other than those as may be required pursuant to the AutoZone Pension Plan or by law) and any stock options shall be governed by the respective stock option agreements in effect between the Employee and AutoZone at that time. Cause shall mean the willful engagement by the Employee in conduct which is demonstrably or materially injurious to AutoZone, monetarily or otherwise. For this purpose, no act or failure to act by the Employee shall be considered willful unless done, or omitted to be done, by the Employee not in good faith and without reasonable belief that his action or omission was in the best interest of AutoZone.

Competitor
The parties acknowledge and agree that the time, scope, geographic area and other provisions of this Non-Compete section have been specifically negotiated by sophisticated commercial parties and specifically hereby agree that such time, scope, geographic area and other provisions are reasonable under the circumstances and are in exchange for the obligations undertaken by AutoZone pursuant to this Agreement.
Further, Employee agrees not to hire, for himself or any other entity, encourage anyone or entity to hire, or entice away from AutoZone any employee of AutoZone during the term of this non-compete obligation.
If at any time a court of competent jurisdiction holds that any portion of this Non-Compete section is unenforceable for any reason, then Employee shall forfeit his right to any further salary, bonus, stock option exercises, or benefits from AutoZone during any Continuation Period. This Paragraph 12 shall not apply to a termination by Employee pursuant to Paragraph 10.
 
(a) . To the extent applicable, this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (together with Department of Treasury regulations and other official guidance issued thereunder, ). Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that AutoZone determines in good faith that any compensation or benefits payable under this Agreement may not be either exempt from or compliant with Section 409A, AutoZone shall consult with the Employee and adopt such amendments to this Agreement or adopt other policies or procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other commercially reasonable actions necessary or appropriate to (i) preserve the intended tax treatment of the compensation and benefits payable hereunder, to preserve the economic benefits of such compensation and benefits, and/or (ii) to exempt the compensation and benefits payable hereunder from Section 409A or to comply with the requirements of Section 409A and thereby avoid the application of penalty taxes thereunder; provided, however, that this Paragraph 16 does not, and shall not be construed so as to, create any obligation on the part of AutoZone to adopt any such amendments, policies or procedures or to take any other such actions or to indemnify the Employee for any failure to do so.
General
Section 409A
 
(b) This Agreement shall be administered and interpreted to maximize the short-term deferral exception to Section 409A of the Code, and Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, designate the taxable year of a payment made under this Agreement. The portion of any payment under this Agreement that is paid within the short-term deferral period within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) shall be treated as a short term deferral and not aggregated with other plans or payments. Any other portion of the payment that does not meet the short term deferral requirement shall, to the maximum extent possible, be deemed to satisfy the exception from Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A) for involuntary separation pay and shall not be aggregated with any other payment. Any right to a series of installment payments pursuant to this Agreement is to be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. Any amount that is paid as a short-term deferral within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), or within the involuntary separation pay limit under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A) shall be treated as a separate payment. Payment dates provided for in this Agreement shall be deemed to incorporate grace periods within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no compensation or benefits, including without limitation any severance payments or benefits payable under Paragraph 8 hereof, shall be paid to Employee during the 6-month period following Employees Separation from Service if AutoZone determines that paying such amounts at the time or times indicated in this Agreement would be a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code. If the payment of any such amounts is delayed as a result of the previous sentence, then on the first business day following the end of such 6-month period (or such earlier date upon which such amount can be paid under Section 409A of the Code without resulting in a prohibited distribution, including as a result of Employees death), AutoZone shall pay Employee a lump-sum amount equal to the cumulative amount that would have otherwise been payable to Employee during such period.
This Paragraph 16(c) shall not apply to that portion of any amounts payable upon a Separation from Service which shall qualify as involuntary severance under Section 409A because such amount does not exceed the lesser of (1) two hundred percent (200%) of the Executives annualized compensation from the Company for the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year during which the Separation from Service occurs, or (2) two hundred percent (200%) of the annual limitation amount under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code for the calendar year during which the Separation from Service occurs.

The parties acknowledge and agree that the time, scope, geographic area and other provisions of this Non-Compete section have been specifically negotiated by sophisticated commercial parties and specifically hereby agree that such time, scope, geographic area and other provisions are reasonable under the circumstances and are in exchange for the obligations undertaken by AutoZone pursuant to this Agreement.

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that AutoZone determines in good faith that any compensation or benefits payable under this Agreement may not be either exempt from or compliant with Section 409A, AutoZone shall consult with the Employee and adopt such amendments to this Agreement or adopt other policies or procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other commercially reasonable actions necessary or appropriate to (i) preserve the intended tax treatment of the compensation and benefits payable hereunder, to preserve the economic benefits of such compensation and benefits, and/or (ii) to exempt the compensation and benefits payable hereunder from Section 409A or to comply with the requirements of Section 409A and thereby avoid the application of penalty taxes thereunder; , that this Paragraph 16 does not, and shall not be construed so as to, create any obligation on the part of AutoZone to adopt any such amendments, policies or procedures or to take any other such actions or to indemnify the Employee for any failure to do so.
General
Section 409A
provided, however
(b) This Agreement shall be administered and interpreted to maximize the short-term deferral exception to Section 409A of the Code, and Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, designate the taxable year of a payment made under this Agreement. The portion of any payment under this Agreement that is paid within the short-term deferral period within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) shall be treated as a short term deferral and not aggregated with other plans or payments. Any other portion of the payment that does not meet the short term deferral requirement shall, to the maximum extent possible, be deemed to satisfy the exception from Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A) for involuntary separation pay and shall not be aggregated with any other payment. Any right to a series of installment payments pursuant to this Agreement is to be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. Any amount that is paid as a short-term deferral within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), or within the involuntary separation pay limit under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A) shall be treated as a separate payment. Payment dates provided for in this Agreement shall be deemed to incorporate grace periods within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no compensation or benefits, including without limitation any severance payments or benefits payable under Paragraph 8 hereof, shall be paid to Employee during the 6-month period following Employees Separation from Service if AutoZone determines that paying such amounts at the time or times indicated in this Agreement would be a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code. If the payment of any such amounts is delayed as a result of the previous sentence, then on the first business day following the end of such 6-month period (or such earlier date upon which such amount can be paid under Section 409A of the Code without resulting in a prohibited distribution, including as a result of Employees death), AutoZone shall pay Employee a lump-sum amount equal to the cumulative amount that would have otherwise been payable to Employee during such period.
 
This Paragraph 16(c) shall not apply to that portion of any amounts payable upon a Separation from Service which shall qualify as involuntary severance under Section 409A because such amount does not exceed the lesser of (1) two hundred percent (200%) of the Executives annualized compensation from the Company for the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year during which the Separation from Service occurs, or (2) two hundred percent (200%) of the annual limitation amount under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code for the calendar year during which the Separation from Service occurs.
17. Any waiver of any breach of this Agreement by AutoZone shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by Employee. No waiver shall be valid unless in writing and signed by an authorized officer of AutoZone.
Waiver.
18. Employee acknowledges that his services are unique and personal. Accordingly, Employee shall not assign his rights or delegate his duties or obligations under this Agreement. Employees rights and obligations under this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon AutoZone successors and assigns.
