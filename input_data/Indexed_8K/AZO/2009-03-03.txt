On March 3, 2009, AutoZone, Inc. ("the Company") issued a press release announcing its earnings for the fiscal quarter ended February 14, 2009, which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(d)    Exhibits
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., March 3, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $1.4 billion for its second quarter (12 weeks) ended February 14, 2009, an increase of 8.1% from fiscal second quarter 2008 (12 weeks). Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, increased 6.0% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased $9.2 million, or 8.6%, over the same period last year to $115.9 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 21.1% to $2.03 per share from $1.67 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 49.7% (versus 49.9% last year). Gross margin was negatively impacted by higher than prior year shrink expense of approximately 30 basis points offset in part by lower distribution costs as a percentage of sales due to improved efficiencies and lower fuel costs. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 34.9% (versus 35.2% last year). The lower operating expense ratio primarily reflected positive leverage of store operating expenses of approximately 80 basis points due to higher sales volumes and lower promotion costs, offset in part by higher investments in hub store enhancements of approximately 20 basis points, higher medical costs, and an increase in legal costs associated with estimates for minor settlements.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 2.8 million shares of its common stock for $375 million during the second quarter, at an average price of $133 per share. Year-to-date the Company has purchased $647.2 million of stock, at an average price of $128 per share. The Company has $462 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.
The Company's GAAP inventory increased 5.9% over the same period last year. Adjusted inventory per store, which includes supplier owned pay-on-scan inventory, was $511 thousand versus $504 thousand last year, an increase of 1.4%. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, decreased on a per store basis to $50 thousand from $55 thousand last year.
"We are pleased to report our tenth consecutive quarter of double digit earnings per share growth. During these challenging economic times, we believe our merchandise and service offerings provide a compelling shopping experience for both our do-it-yourself and professional customers. We remain committed to growing our business through a relentless focus on customer service, continual refinement of our product offerings and ongoing improvements to grow our commercial sales, all while managing our expenses appropriately. At the end of the second quarter, our balance sheet was in excellent condition, and we remain committed to our disciplined approach of growing operating earnings while utilizing our capital effectively," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter ended February 14, 2009, AutoZone opened 20 new stores and closed one store in the U.S. and opened eight stores in Mexico. As of February 14, 2009, the Company had 4,141 stores in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 158 stores in Mexico.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include return on invested capital, adjusted inventory, adjusted inventory per store, adjusted debt, and adjusted debt/EBITDAR. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.
Certain statements contained in this press release are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy," and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation: competition; product demand; the economy; credit markets; the ability to hire and retain qualified employees; consumer debt levels; inflation; weather; raw material costs of our suppliers; energy prices; war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity; availability of consumer transportation; construction delays; access to available and feasible financing; and changes in laws or r egulations. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results; developments and business decisions may differ from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, and such events could materially and adversely affect our business. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
