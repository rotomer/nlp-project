        99.1    Press Release dated May 27, 2009.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., May 27, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $1.7 billion for its third quarter (12 weeks) ended May 9, 2009, an increase of 9.3% from fiscal third quarter 2008 (12 weeks). Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, increased 7.4% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased $15.1 million, or 9.5%, over the same period last year to $173.7 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 25.9% to $3.13 per share from $2.49 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 50.2% (versus 50.2% last year). Gross margin benefited by approximately 15 basis points through leverage of distribution costs due to improved efficiencies and lower fuel costs, but was offset by the impact of promotional activities. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 31.8% (versus 32.2% last year). The lower operating expense ratio reflected leverage of store operating expenses due to higher sales volumes, offset in part by approximately 50 basis points from higher incentive compensation and investments to enhance our hub stores.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 450 thousand shares of its common stock for $65 million during the third quarter, at an average price of $145 per share. Year-to-date the Company has purchased $713 million of stock, at an average price of $130 per share. The Company has $396 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.
The Company's GAAP inventory increased 6.4% over the same period last year. Inventory per store was $516 thousand versus $506 thousand last year, an increase of 2.0%. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, decreased on a per store basis to $33 thousand from $56 thousand last year.
"We are pleased to report our eleventh consecutive quarter of double digit earnings per share growth. I would like to thank our AutoZoners across the organization for their commitment to excellence and for their diligence to ensure we meet or exceed our customers' expectations. While the current economic environment, combined with the reduction in fuel prices compared to last year, has clearly been beneficial to our industry's performance, we are very pleased with our organization's ability to capitalize on these favorable trends. At the end of the third quarter, our balance sheet was in excellent condition, and we remain committed to our disciplined approach of growing operating earnings while utilizing our capital effectively," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter ended May 9, 2009, AutoZone opened 32 new stores, closed one store, and relocated four stores in the U.S. and opened 10 stores in Mexico. As of May 9, 2009, the Company had 4,172 stores in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 168 stores in Mexico.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include return on invested capital, adjusted debt, and adjusted debt/EBITDAR. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation t ables.

Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy," and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation: competition; product demand; the economy; credit markets; the ability to hire and retain qualified employees; consumer debt levels; inflation; weather; raw material costs of our suppliers; energy prices; war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity; availability of consumer transportation; construction delays; access to available and feasible financing; and changes in laws or r egulations. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results; developments and business decisions may differ from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, and such events could materially and adversely affect our business.

Prior to May 9, 2009, we classified short term debt obligations as long-term as we had the ability and intent to replace these short term obligations with long-term financing under our $1.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, expiring May 5, 2010. We expect to renegotiate our revolving credit facility during the fourth quarter to extend beyond 12 months, at which time we will reclassify these obligations as long term.
