Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
    Exhibit 99.1.       Press release dated September 23, 2009
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Sept. 23, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $2.2 billion for its fourth quarter (16 weeks) ended August 29, 2009, an increase of 1.0% from fiscal fourth quarter 2008 (17 weeks). Excluding sales from the additional week included in the prior year's quarter, sales were up 7.1%, and domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, increased 5.4% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter decreased 3.1% from the same period last year to $236.1 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 14.2% to $4.43 per share from $3.88 per share in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the additional week in last year's fourth quarter results, comparable net income for the quarter increased 3.6% over the previous year's quarter, while diluted earnings per share increased 22.0%.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 50.3% (versus 50.3% last year). While gross margin was positively impacted through continued leverage of distribution costs due to improved efficiencies and lower fuel costs, it was offset by a shift in merchandise sales mix to lower margin products. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 31.6% (versus 31.4% last year). Excluding the impact from last year's additional week, operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were flat with last year. Leverage from increased sales was largely offset by our continued investments in our enhanced hub stores and an acceleration of our store maintenance program. Additionally, included in operating expenses this quarter was a $3.6 million interest rate swap termination amount (16 bps) related to the prepayment of AutoZone's $300 million bank loan due in December 2009.
For the fiscal year ended August 29, 2009, sales were $6.8 billion, an increase of 4.5% from the prior year, while domestic same store sales were up 4.4%. Operating profit increased 4.6% on an operating margin of 17.3%. For fiscal 2009, net income increased 2.4% to $657 million, while diluted earnings per share for the period increased 16.8% to $11.73 from $10.04. Excluding results from last year's additional week, sales increased 6.6% from the prior year, and operating profit increased 7.2%. Excluding last year's extra week, net income increased 5.0% and diluted earnings per share increased 19.7%.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 3.8 million shares of its common stock for $587 million during the fourth quarter, at an average price of $154 per share. For the fiscal year, the Company repurchased 9.3 million shares of its common stock for $1.3 billion, at an average price of $140 per share.
The Company's inventory increased 2.7% over the same period last year. However, inventory per store was $500 thousand versus $507 thousand last year, a decrease of 1.4%. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, decreased on a per store basis to $20 thousand from $25 thousand last year. The Company believes the continued refinement of its hub and satellite store network heading into the new fiscal year will continue to help mitigate inventory growth while adding more late model parts coverage.
"We are very pleased with our comparable performance for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2009. Our plan has remained generally consistent, and we have focused our efforts on enhancing the customer experience. In fiscal 2009, we again expanded our parts assortment, significantly increased the number of markets supported by our enhanced Hub store model, expanded our Commercial sales force, increased formalized training, and leveraged new technologies all primarily focused on customer service improvements. As our sales performance improved, we elected to accelerate the expansion of several of these initiatives to better position us to continue to grow our sales for the future. In fiscal 2009, we experienced market share gains in each of our four businesses. I'd like to thank all our AutoZoners across North America for their dedication and passionate commitment to our customers and our organization. Finally, I'd like to highlight that our return on invested capital increased again ending the year at 24.4 %. This performance highlights our commitment to a disciplined approach of increasing operating earnings and utilizing our capital effectively," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
During the quarter AutoZone opened 58 new stores, closed one store, and replaced three stores in the U.S. and opened 20 stores in Mexico. As of August 29, 2009, the Company had 4,229 stores in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 188 stores in Mexico.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include return on invested capital, adjusted debt, adjusted debt/EBITDAR, and adjusted consolidated statements of operations. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GA AP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.

Forward-looking statements typically use words such as "believe," "anticipate," "should," "intend," "plan," "will," "expect," "estimate," "project," "positioned," "strategy," and similar expressions. These are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate.
