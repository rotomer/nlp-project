ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
     On November 15, 2010, AutoZone, Inc. (the "Company") completed the sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.000% Notes due 2020 (the "Notes"). The Notes bear interest at a fixed rate equal to 4.000% per year, payable semi-annually.
     The Notes were sold pursuant to an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") dated November 8, 2010 among the Company, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein. The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and customary conditions to closing, indemnification rights and obligations of the parties and termination provisions. The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture dated as of August 8, 2003 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, and were offered and sold pursuant to the Company's shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on July 29, 2008, on Form S-3 (File No. 333-152592), as supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated November 8, 2010, filed with the Commission on November 9, 2010. Pursuant to the Indenture, the Company entered into an Officers' Certificate (the "Officers' Certificate") setting forth the terms of the Notes.
     The Company will pay interest on the Notes on May 15 and November 15 each year, beginning May 15, 2011. The Notes will mature on November 15, 2020. The Notes will be senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and will rank equally with the Company's other senior unsecured liabilities and senior to any future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The Notes are subject to customary covenants restricting the Company's ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur debt secured by liens, to enter into sale and leaseback transactions or to merge or consolidate with another entity or sell substantially all of its assets to another person. The Indenture provides for customary events of default and further provides that the trustee or the holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding series of Notes may declare such Notes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of any event of default after expiration of any applicable grace period.
     The Company may redeem the Notes at the Company's option, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the redemption prices described in the Officer's Certificate. If a change of control, as defined in the Officers' Certificate, occurs, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem the Notes, holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase the Notes at the prices described in the Officers' Certificate.
     The above description of the Underwriting Agreement, the Officers' Certificate and the Notes is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, the Officers' Certificate pursuant to the Indenture setting forth the terms of the Notes, and the form of Note, each of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 1.1, 4.1, 4.2, respectively.
 
ITEM 2.03. CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT.
     The information set forth under Item 1.01 above with respect to the Notes is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03, insofar as it relates to the creation of a direct financial obligation.

Possession of Intellectual Property
 
     (xx) . The Company and its subsidiaries have good and marketable title to all real property owned by the Company and its subsidiaries and good title to all other properties owned by them, in each case, free and clear of all mortgages, pledges, liens, security interests, claims, restrictions or encumbrances of any kind, except (A) as otherwise stated in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus or (B) those which do not, singly or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect and do not interfere with the use made and proposed to be made of such property by the Company or any of its subsidiaries. All of the leases and subleases of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, and under which the Company or any of its subsidiaries holds properties described in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, are in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and effect, individually or in the aggregate, would not result in a Material Adverse Effect, and neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received any written notice of any claim of any sort that has been asserted by anyone adverse to the rights of the Company or any of its subsidiaries under any of the leases or subleases mentioned above, or affecting or questioning the rights of the Company or such subsidiary of the continued possession of the leased or subleased premises under any such lease or sublease where such claim or claims, individually or in the aggregate, would result in a Material Adverse Effect.
Title to Property
     (xxi) . The Company is not, and upon the issuance and sale of the Securities as herein contemplated and the application of the net proceeds therefrom as described in the Prospectus will not be, an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act").

The Company will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment.
     (b) . The Company will give the Representatives notice of its intention to file or prepare any amendment to the Registration Statement or any new registration statement relating to the Securities or any amendment, supplement or revision to either any preliminary prospectus (including any prospectus included in the Registration Statement or amendment thereto) at the time it became effective or to the Prospectus, whether pursuant to the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or otherwise, and the Company will furnish the Representatives with copies of any such documents a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing or use, as the case may be, and will not file or use any such document to which the Representatives or counsel to the Underwriters shall reasonably object.

If at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement (or any other registration statement relating to the Securities) or the Statutory Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus or included or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances prevailing at that subsequent time, not misleading, the Company will promptly notify the Representatives and will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict, untrue statement or omission.
Continued Compliance with Securities Laws

Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Company and the Representatives is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company represents that it has treated or agrees that it will treat each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, and has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission where required, legending and record keeping.

     (i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information deemed to be a part thereof, if applicable, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
     (ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission in each case as described in paragraph 6(a)(i) above; provided that (subject to Section 6(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
     (iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representatives), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, in each case as described in paragraph 6(a)(i) above, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information, or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
     (b) . Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity
Indemnification of Company, Directors and Officers
 
contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information, or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
     (c) . Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Actions against Parties; Notification
     (d) . If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested in writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid written request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such written request prior to the date of such settlement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested in writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (x) such indemnifying party reimburses
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
 
such indemnified party in accordance with such request to the extent it considers such request to be reasonable; and (y) such indemnifying party provides written notice to the indemnified party substantiating the unpaid balance as unreasonable, in each case prior to the date of such settlement.
          SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
     The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus.
     The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
     No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I, and not joint.
          SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities; provided, however, that the representations and warranties of the Company shall be deemed to be made as of the date of execution of this Agreement and the Closing Time only.
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery
          SECTION 9. .
Termination
     (a) . The Representatives may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the Closing Time if (i) there has been, since the time of execution of this Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the General Disclosure Package, (1) any material adverse change in the financial condition, earnings, management or business of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (2) any development involving a prospective material adverse change in or affecting the financial condition, earnings, management or business of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the General Disclosure Package, in any case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (ii) there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or, if the Securities include Securities denominated or payable in, or indexed to, one or more foreign or composite currencies, in the international financial markets, or any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or a declaration of a national emergency or war by the United States or other calamity or crisis or any material adverse change or development involving a prospective material adverse change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (iii) trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or trading generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter market has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum
Underwriting Agreement
 
or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by such exchange or by such market or by order of the Commission, FINRA or any other governmental authority, or (iv) a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal or New York authorities or, if the Securities include Securities denominated or payable in, or indexed to, one or more foreign or composite currencies, by the relevant authorities in the related foreign country or countries or a material disruption shall have occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States.
     (b) . If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 9, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that Sections 1, 6, 7, 8 and 15 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.
Liabilities
          SECTION 10. . If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Time to purchase the Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase hereunder (the "Defaulted Securities"), then the Representatives shall have the right, within 36 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representatives shall not have completed such arrangements within such 36-hour period, then:
Default by One or More of the Underwriters
     (a) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Securities to be purchased hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or
     (b) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Securities to be purchased hereunder, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
     No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
     In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.
          SECTION 11. . All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication.

Exhibit 4.1
EXECUTION VERSION
     A.Pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of AutoZone, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the "Company"), adopted on March 16, 2010 (the "Resolutions"), the undersigned, Brian L. Campbell, Vice President and Treasurer, and William T. Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the Company certify that pursuant to the Resolutions and Section 3.2 of the Indenture, dated as of August 8, 2003 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), there is hereby established a series of Securities (as that term is defined in the Indenture), the terms and form of which shall be as follows (capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture):
          (a) The title of the series of the Securities shall be "4.000% Senior Notes due 2020" (the "Notes").
          (b) The Notes shall be issued at a price of 99.560% of the principal amount thereof.
          (c) The aggregate principal amount of the Notes that may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture (except for Notes authenticated and delivered upon registration of, transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Notes pursuant to Sections 3.7, 3.8, 3.11, 4.7 or 10.6 of the Indenture) initially shall be $500,000,000. The Company may, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, create and issue additional Notes ranking equally and ratably with the Notes and otherwise identical to the Notes in all respects, except for the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional Notes and, in some cases, the first payment of interest following the issue date of such additional Notes and the initial interest accrual date thereof, so that such further Notes shall form a single series with the Notes.
          (d) The principal amount of the Notes shall be payable in full on November 15, 2020, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.
          (e) The Notes shall bear interest at the rate of 4.000% per annum from November 15, 2010, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, payable semiannually on May 15 and November 15 of each year (each an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing on May 15, 2011, until the principal amount of the Notes has been paid or duly provided for. May 1 and November 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding an Interest Payment Date, shall be a "Regular Record Date" for the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date.
          (f) The principal of and interest on the Notes shall be payable at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in New York, New York.
          (g) The Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Company, at any time in whole or from time to time in part. If the Notes are redeemed before August 15, 2020, the redemption price will equal accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes to be redeemed; and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on such Notes (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of
 
redemption on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus 25 basis points, as determined in good faith by the Company.
     If the Notes are redeemed on or after August 15, 2020, the redemption price for the Notes will equal accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed plus 100% of the principal amount of the Notes.
     Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.4 of the Indenture, notice of any redemption of Notes before August 15, 2020 need not set forth the redemption price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Company shall give the Trustee notice of the amount of the redemption price for any such redemption promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall have no responsibility for such calculation. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions of the Notes called for redemption.
     "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the rate per year equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for that date of redemption.
     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and under customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such date of redemption, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
     "Quotation Agent" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Company.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and its successors and any other primary U.S. government securities dealers in New York City the Company selects (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer"). If any of the foregoing ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company must substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any date of redemption, the average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such date of redemption.
          (h) The Notes will be issued only in registered form in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
 
          (i) The Notes shall be issuable in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Securities. Such Global Securities may be exchanged in whole or in part for individual Securities in definitive form only on the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. The initial Depository for such Global Securities shall be The Depository Trust Company.
          (j) The Notes shall be denominated in Dollars and the payment of the principal of and interest on the Notes shall be in Dollars.
          (k) The Notes shall be defeasible as provided in Article IX of the Indenture.
          (l) The Notes shall not be subject to any mandatory sinking fund.
          (m) If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs with respect to the Notes, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Notes as described in Section 4.2 of the Indenture and clause (A)(g) of this Officers' Certificate, Holders of Notes shall have the right to require the Company to make an offer to each Holder of Notes to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that Holder's Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change of Control Offer") on the terms set forth in the Notes. In the Change of Control Offer, the Company shall be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of repurchase (the "Change of Control Payment"). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the Company's option, prior to the date of the consummation of any Change of Control, but after the public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, the Company shall be required to mail a notice to the Holders of the Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the applicable notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date"), pursuant to the procedures required by the Notes and described in such notice. The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of the consummation of the Change of Control, state that the Change of Control Offer is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the applicable Change of Control Payment Date. The Company must comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the Notes, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the Notes by virtue of such conflicts.
     "Capital Stock" of a corporation means the capital stock of every class whether now or hereafter authorized, regardless of whether such capital stock shall be limited to a fixed sum or percentage with respect to the rights of the holders thereof to participate in dividends and in the distribution of assets upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of such corporation.
     "Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or more series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the Company's assets and the assets of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person, other than the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person, other than the Company or one of its Subsidiaries; (2) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation,
 
any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any Person becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Company's outstanding Voting Stock or other Voting Stock into which the Company's Voting Stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed, measured by voting power rather than number of shares; (3) the Company consolidates with, or merges with or into, any Person, or any Person consolidates with, or merges with or into, the Company, in any such event pursuant to a transaction in which any of the Company's outstanding Voting Stock or the Voting Stock of such other Person is converted into or exchanged for cash, securities or other property, other than any such transaction where the shares of the Company's Voting Stock outstanding immediately prior to such transaction constitute, or are converted into or exchanged for, a majority of the Voting Stock of the surviving Person or any direct or indirect parent company of the surviving Person immediately after giving effect to such transaction; (4) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Board of Directors are not Continuing Directors; or (5) the adoption of a plan relating to the Company's liquidation or dissolution.

(xiii) Liens existing on November 8, 2010, or any extension, amendments, renewals, refinancings, replacements or other modifications thereto.
          (q) Clause (xviii) of the definition of "Permitted Liens" in the Indenture is hereby replaced and superseded in its entirety to read as follows:

          (r) Section 7.1(e) of the Indenture is hereby amended by replacing the reference to "$35 million" set forth therein with a reference to "$75 million."

          (v) The Notes shall have additional terms and conditions as set forth in, and shall be substantially in the form of, Annex A attached hereto, with such modifications thereto as may be approved by the authorized officer or officers executing the same.
          (w) The Trustee shall be the trustee for or on behalf of the Holders of the Notes.

Original Issue Date: November 15, 2010 Interest Payment Dates: May 15 and November 15 Maturity Date: November 15, 2020 Interest Rate: 4.000%
     AUTOZONE, INC., a Nevada corporation (hereinafter called the "Company", which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum of five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) (the "Principal Amount") on the Maturity Date shown above, except as provided below, and to pay interest thereon at the rate per annum shown above. (Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture referred to below unless otherwise indicated.) The Company will pay interest semiannually on the Interest Payment Dates, commencing on May 15, 2011. Interest on this Note will accrue from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for, from the Original Issue Date shown above.
 
The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such interest, which shall be the May 1 or the November 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date.
     Payment of the principal of and interest on this Note will be made at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in New York, New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.
     If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on this Note, it shall pay the defaulted interest, plus, to the extent permitted by law, any interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the persons who are Securityholders of this Note on a subsequent special record date. The Company shall fix that record date and payment date. At least ten (10) days before that record date, the Company shall mail to the Trustee and to each Securityholder a notice that states that record date, the payment date and the amount of interest and any interest thereon to be paid. The Company may pay defaulted interest and any interest thereon in any other lawful manner.
     This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (the "Securities"), of the Series hereinafter specified, all issued under and pursuant to an indenture, dated as of August 8, 2003, together with the Officers' Certificate dated November 15, 2010 (the "Officers' Certificate"), establishing the terms of the Notes (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (as successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, N.A.), as Trustee (the "Trustee"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and Holders of the Securities. The aggregate principal amount of Securities that may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture is unlimited. The Securities may be issued in one or more Series, which different Series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided. This Note is one of a Series designated as the "4.000% Senior Notes due 2020" of the Company (herein referred to as the "Notes"), initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000). The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the holders of the Notes, create and issue additional Notes ranking equally and ratably with the Notes and otherwise identical in all respects, except for the issue price, the issue date, the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional Notes and, in some cases, the first payment of interest following the issue date of such additional Notes and the initial interest accrual date thereof, so that such further Notes shall be consolidated and form a single Series with the Notes.
     The Notes constitute senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment among themselves and with all other existing and future senior, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Company.
 
     In accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Officers' Certificate, the Holders of the Notes may require that the Company repurchase the Notes if a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred.
     The Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Company at any time, in whole or from time to time in part. If the Notes are redeemed before August 15, 2020, the redemption price will equal accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on such Notes being redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus 25 basis points, as determined in good faith by the Company.
     If the Notes are redeemed on or after August 15, 2020, the redemption price for the Notes will equal accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed plus 100% of the principal amount of the Notes.
     Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.4 of the Indenture, notice of any redemption of Notes before August 15, 2020 need not set forth the redemption price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Company shall give the Trustee notice of the amount of the redemption price for any such redemption promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall have no responsibility for such calculation. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions of the Notes called for redemption.
     "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such date of redemption.
     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and under customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such date of redemption, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer than four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
     "Quotation Agent" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Company.
 
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and its successors and any other primary U.S. government securities dealers in New York City the Company selects (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer"). If any of the foregoing ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company must substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any date of redemption, the average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by the Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day before the date of redemption.
     The Notes will not be subject to, or have the benefit of, any sinking fund.
     In case an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, or shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture provides that, subject to certain conditions therein set forth, any such declaration of acceleration and its consequences may be waived by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes.
     The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes to be affected thereby, as provided in the Indenture, to enter into supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Notes; and the Indenture also contains provisions allowing the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes to waive compliance with any provision of the Indenture or this Note; , , that no such supplemental indenture or amendment or waiver may, without the consent of each Holder of Notes to be affected (a) reduce the amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver; (b) reduce the rate of, change the method of determination of or extend the time for payment of interest (including default interest) on any Note; (c) reduce the principal or change the Stated Maturity of any Note; (d) make any change in the provisions concerning waivers of Events of Default by Holders or the rights of Holders to recover the principal of or interest on any Note; (e) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration); (f) make the principal of or interest on any Note payable in any currency other than that stated in the Note; (g) make any change in Sections 7.8, 7.13, or 10.3 of the Indenture; or (h) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note. The Indenture also provides that the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes waive any past Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes and its consequences, except a Default (i) in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (provided, however, that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration) or (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which cannot
provided
however
 
be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Notes affected. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Any such waiver by the Holders of the Notes shall be conclusive and binding upon the Holder of this Note and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange or substitution hereof.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the Indenture prescribed.
     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable by the Holder hereof on the register of the Company, upon due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer at the office of the Registrar, or at the office of any co-registrar duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to, the Company and the Registrar or any such co-registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of authorized denominations and for an equal principal amount will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
     No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
     The Notes are issuable only as registered Notes without coupons in denominations equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for new Notes of any authorized denominations of an equal principal amount as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
     Notwithstanding the other provisions of the Indenture, payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on any Note represented by a Global Security shall be made to the Holder thereof. The Company and the Trustee understand that interest on any such Global Security will be disbursed or credited by the Depository to the persons having beneficial ownership thereof pursuant to a book-entry or other system maintained by the Depository.
     Except as provided in the foregoing paragraph, the Company, the Trustee and any Agent shall treat a person as the Holder of such principal amount of outstanding Notes represented by a Global Security as shall be specified in a written statement of the Depository with respect to such Global Security, for purposes of obtaining any consents, declarations, waivers or directions required to be given by the Holders pursuant to this Indenture.
     The Holder of this Note shall not have recourse for the payment of principal of or interest on this Note or for any claim based on this Note or the Indenture against any director, officer,
 
employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company. By acceptance of this Note, the Holder waives and releases all such liability.
     THE INDENTURE AND THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS THEREOF.

If the Notes are redeemed before August 15, 2020, the redemption price will equal accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on such Notes being redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus 25 basis points, as determined in good faith by the Company.
     If the Notes are redeemed on or after August 15, 2020, the redemption price for the Notes will equal accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed plus 100% of the principal amount of the Notes.
     Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.4 of the Indenture, notice of any redemption of Notes before August 15, 2020 need not set forth the redemption price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Company shall give the Trustee notice of the amount of the redemption price for any such redemption promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall have no responsibility for such calculation. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions of the Notes called for redemption.
     "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such date of redemption.
     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and under customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any date of redemption, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such date of redemption, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer than four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
     "Quotation Agent" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Company.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and its successors and any other primary U.S. government securities dealers in New York City
 
the Company selects (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer"). If any of the foregoing ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company must substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any date of redemption, the average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by the Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day before the date of redemption.
     The Notes will not be subject to, or have the benefit of, any sinking fund.
     In case an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, or shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture provides that, subject to certain conditions therein set forth, any such declaration of acceleration and its consequences may be waived by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes.
     The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes to be affected thereby, as provided in the Indenture, to enter into supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Notes; and the Indenture also contains provisions allowing the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes to waive compliance with any provision of the Indenture or this Note; , , that no such supplemental indenture or amendment or waiver may, without the consent of each Holder of Notes to be affected (a) reduce the amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver; (b) reduce the rate of, change the method of determination of or extend the time for payment of interest (including default interest) on any Note; (c) reduce the principal or change the Stated Maturity of any Note; (d) make any change in the provisions concerning waivers of Events of Default by Holders or the rights of Holders to recover the principal of or interest on any Note; (e) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration); (f) make the principal of or interest on any Note payable in any currency other than that stated in the Note; (g) make any change in Sections 7.8, 7.13, or 10.3 of the Indenture; or (h) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note. The Indenture also provides that the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes waive any past Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes and its consequences, except a Default (i) in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (provided, however, that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration) or (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Notes affected. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising
provided
however
 
therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Any such waiver by the Holders of the Notes shall be conclusive and binding upon the Holder of this Note and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange or substitution hereof.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the Indenture prescribed.

     No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
     The Notes are issuable only as registered Notes without coupons in denominations equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for new Notes of any authorized denominations of an equal principal amount as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
     Notwithstanding the other provisions of the Indenture, payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on any Note represented by a Global Security shall be made to the Holder thereof. The Company and the Trustee understand that interest on any such Global Security will be disbursed or credited by the Depository to the persons having beneficial ownership thereof pursuant to a book-entry or other system maintained by the Depository.
     Except as provided in the foregoing paragraph, the Company, the Trustee and any Agent shall treat a person as the Holder of such principal amount of outstanding Notes represented by a Global Security as shall be specified in a written statement of the Depository with respect to such Global Security, for purposes of obtaining any consents, declarations, waivers or directions required to be given by the Holders pursuant to this Indenture.
     The Holder of this Note shall not have recourse for the payment of principal of or interest on this Note or for any claim based on this Note or the Indenture against any director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company.
