EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Dec. 7, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $1.8 billion for its first quarter (12 weeks) ended November 20, 2010, an increase of 12.7% from the first quarter of fiscal 2010 (12 weeks). Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, increased 9.5% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased $28.8 million, or 20.1%, over the same period last year to $172.1 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 33.7% to $3.77 per share from $2.82 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 50.7% (versus 50.3% for last year's quarter). The improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to increased penetration of Duralast product offerings and lower product acquisition costs. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 33.6% (versus 33.9% last year).  The reduction in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, reflected leverage of store operating expenses due to higher sales, partially offset by increased incentive compensation costs (35 basis points), higher legal expenses (27 bps), and continued investments in our hub store initiative (18 basis points).
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 1.3 million shares of its common stock for $300 million during the first quarter, at an average price of $231 per share. At quarter end, the Company had $386 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.
The Company's inventory increased 4.4% over the same period last year, driven by new store openings. Inventory per store was $508 thousand consistent with last year.  
"We are pleased to announce another quarter of strong performance.  This marks the eighth consecutive quarter of 20% plus growth in earnings per share and our seventeenth consecutive quarter of double digit growth.  While the macro environment for our industry remains favorable, our results are a direct result of the strong commitment to excellence of our 60,000+ AutoZoners across North America.  Their commitment to our culture and to our customers is our key point of differentiation.  Additionally, our return on invested capital on a trailing four-quarter basis reached another new all-time high at 28.6%.  We remain committed to our disciplined approach of growing operating earnings while utilizing our capital appropriately," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. 
During the quarter ended November 20, 2010, AutoZone opened 15 new stores and replaced four stores in the U.S. and opened 3 new stores in Mexico. As of November 20, 2010, the Company had 4,404 stores in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 241 stores in Mexico.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include return on invested capital, adjusted debt, and adjusted debt/EBITDAR. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's capital structure in order to maintain its investment grade credit ratings and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.
