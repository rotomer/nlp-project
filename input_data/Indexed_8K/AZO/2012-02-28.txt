EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Feb. 28, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) today reported net sales of $1.8 billion for its second quarter (12 weeks) ended February 11, 2012, an increase of 8.6% from the second quarter of fiscal 2011 (12 weeks). Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, increased 5.9% for the quarter.
Net income for the quarter increased $18.9 million, or 12.7%, over the same period last year to $166.9 million, while diluted earnings increased 24.4% to $4.15 per share from $3.34 per share in the year-ago quarter.
For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 51.3% (versus 50.9% for last year's quarter). The improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to lower shrink expense (35 bps). Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 34.7% (versus 34.6% last year). The primary contributor to the increase in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, was higher self insurance costs (59 bps), partially offset by leverage of other operating expenses due to higher sales volumes.
Under its share repurchase program, AutoZone repurchased 501 thousand shares of its common stock for $173 million during the second quarter, at an average price of $345 per share. At quarter end, the Company had $486 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.
The Company's inventory increased 6.6% over the same period last year, driven by an increase in store count and continued strategic investments in hard parts assortment. However, inventory per store was $530 thousand versus $517 thousand last year, an increase of 2.3%.
"We are pleased to announce another quarter of strong performance. This marks the thirteenth consecutive quarter of 20% plus growth in earnings per share and our twenty second consecutive quarter of double digit growth. We remain committed to executing our 2012 operating theme of "1TEAM; ." We continued our focus on improving parts coverage; hiring, retaining, and training the best automotive parts professionals; and growing our Commercial business. The commitment of our more than 65,000 AutoZoners to providing trustworthy advice is what sets our company apart, and it is their dedication to meeting and exceeding our customers' needs that leads to our success. Additionally, our return on invested capital on a trailing four-quarter basis reached another new all-time high at 32.2%. We remain committed to our disciplined approach of growing operating earnings while efficiently utilizing our capital," said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.

This release includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include return on invested capital, adjusted debt, adjusted debt to EBITDAR, and cash flow before share repurchases. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results, but this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management targets the Company's capital structure in order to maintain its investment grade credit ratings and manages cash flows available for share repurchase by monitoring cash flows before share repurchases, as shown on the attached tables. The Company believes this is important information for the management of its debt levels and share repurchases. We have included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.
