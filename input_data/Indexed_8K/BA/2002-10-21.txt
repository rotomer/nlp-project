Item 5. Other Events
      Pursuant to the "Consent and Undertaking of The Boeing Company," dated July 26, 1978 and issued by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, in Civil Action No. 78-1383, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") as plaintiff, The Boeing Company (the "Company") agreed to file a statement with the Commission whenever the Company made a change in its statement of policies and procedures as to the appointment of foreign sales consultants.
     The Company has revised its procedure establishing requirements of, and internal responsibilities for, the Company's process for doing business with foreign sales consultants. The Company also revised its policy with respect to consultant services to reflect the changes in the foreign sales consultant procedure.
     Significant changes implemented by the revised procedure include the following:
      These changes were made (a) to broaden application of the procedure to ensure more comprehensive compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and (b) to improve the management and processing of prospective international service contracts.
      Company policy POL-14, "Consultant Services," was revised September 27, 2002, consistent with the changes described above. The substantive revisions specify that the requirements of POL-14 that apply to foreign sales consultants apply to other international service consultants as well.
