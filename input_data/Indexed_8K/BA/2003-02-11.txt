    Introductory.
    The Boeing Company, a Delaware corporation ("
Company
"), proposes to issue and sell from time to time certain of its unsecured debt securities registered under the registration statement referred to in Section 2(a) or such other registration statement that may be filed by the Company ("
Registered Securities
"). The Registered Securities will be issued under an indenture, dated as of February 1, 2003 ("
Indenture
"), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as trustee (the "
Trustee
"), in one or more series, which series may vary as to interest rates, maturities, redemption provisions, selling prices and other terms, with all such terms for any particular series of the Registered Securities being determined at the time of sale. Particular series of the Registered Securities will be sold pursuant to a Terms Agreement referred to in Section 3, for resale in accordance with the terms of offering determined at the time of sale. The provisions contained in these Underwriting Provisions are hereinafter referred to as the "
Provisions
".
        The Registered Securities involved in any such offering are hereinafter referred to as the "
Offered Securities
". The firm or firms which agree to purchase the Offered Securities are hereinafter referred to as the "
Underwriters
" of such securities, and the representative or representatives of the Underwriters, if any, specified in a Terms Agreement referred to in Section 3 or if not referred to in Section 3 then the Underwriter first named in the Terms Agreement are hereinafter referred to as the "
Representatives
"; provided, however, that if the Terms Agreement does not specify any representative of the Underwriters, the term "Representatives", as used in these Provisions (other than in Sections 2(b), 5(c) and 6 and the second sentence of Section 3), shall mean the Underwriters.
        2.
    Representations and Warranties of the Company.
    The Company, as of the date of each Terms Agreement referred to in Section 3, represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the several Underwriters that:
        (a)  A registration statement (No. 333-99509), including a prospectus, relating to the Registered Securities has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("
Commission
") and has become effective. Such registration statement, as amended at the time of any Terms Agreement referred to in Section 3, is hereinafter referred to as the "
Registration Statement
", and the prospectus included in such Registration Statement, as supplemented as contemplated by Section 3 to reflect the terms of the Offered Securities and the terms of offering thereof, as filed or to be filed with the Commission pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 424(b) ("
Rule 424(b)
") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
Act
"), including all material incorporated by reference therein, is hereinafter referred to as the "
Prospectus
"; provided, however, that all references to the "Registration Statement" and the "Prospectus" shall also be deemed to include all documents incorporated therein by reference pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "
Exchange Act"
), prior to the execution and delivery of the applicable Terms Agreement; and provided, further, that if the Company files a registration statement with the Commission pursuant to Section 462(b) (the "Rule 462(b) Registration Statement") of the rules and regulations promulgated under the Act (the "
1933 Act Regulations
"), then after such filing, all references to "Registration Statement" shall also be deemed to include the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement. No document has been or will be prepared or distributed in reliance on Rule 434 under the Act.
        All references in these Provisions to financial statements and schedules and other information which is "contained," "included" or "stated" in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or other references of like import) shall be deemed to mean and include all such financial statements and schedules and other information which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be; and all references in these Provisions to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be.
        (b)  On its effective date, the Registration Statement conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 ("
Trust Indenture Act
") and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission ("
Rules and Regulations
") and did not include any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and on the date of each Terms Agreement referred to in Section 3, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Act, the Trust Indenture Act and the Rules and Regulations, and neither of such documents include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except that the foregoing does not apply to statements in or omissions from any of such documents based upon written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter specifically for use therein or the Form T-1.

        3.
    Purchase, Sale and Delivery of Offered Securities.
    The obligation of the Underwriters to purchase the Offered Securities will be evidenced by an agreement or exchange of other written communications ("
Terms Agreement
") at the time the Company determines to sell the Offered Securities. The Terms Agreement will incorporate by reference the Provisions, except as otherwise provided therein, and will specify the firm or firms which will be Underwriters, the names of any Representatives, the principal amount to be purchased by each Underwriter, the purchase price to be paid by the Underwriters and the terms of the Offered Securities not already specified in the Indenture, including, but not limited to, interest, maturity, any redemption provisions and any sinking fund requirements. The Terms Agreement will also specify the time and date of delivery and payment (such time and date, or such other time not later than seven full business days thereafter as the Representative and the Company agree as the time for payment and delivery, being herein and in the Terms Agreement referred to as the "
Closing Date
"), the place of delivery and payment and any details of the terms of offering that should be reflected in the Prospectus relating to the offering of the Offered Securities. For purposes of Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Closing Date (if later than the otherwise applicable settlement date) shall be the date for payment of funds and delivery of securities for all the Offered Securities sold pursuant to the offering. The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Offered Securities will be several and not joint. It is understood that the Underwriters propose to offer the Offered Securities for sale as set forth in the Prospectus.
        If the Terms Agreement specifies "Book-Entry Only" settlement or otherwise states that the provisions of this paragraph shall apply, the Company will deliver against payment of the purchase price the Offered Securities in the form of one or more permanent global securities in definitive form (the "
Global Securities
") deposited with the Trustee as custodian for The Depository Trust Company ("
DTC
") and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC. Interests in any permanent global securities will be held only in book-entry form through DTC, except in the limited circumstances described in the Prospectus. Payment for the Offered Securities shall be made by the Underwriters in Federal (same day) funds by wire transfer to an account previously designated by the Company at a bank acceptable to the Representatives, at the place of payment specified in the Terms Agreement on the Closing Date, against delivery to the Trustee as custodian for DTC of the Global Securities representing all of the Offered Securities.

        (c)  If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Offered Securities is required to be delivered under the Act in connection with sales by any Underwriter or dealer any event occurs as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it is necessary at any time to amend the Prospectus to comply with the Act, the Company promptly will notify the Representatives of such event and will promptly prepare and file with the Commission, at its own expense, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment which will effect such compliance. Neither the Representative's consent to, nor the Underwriters' delivery of, any such amendment or supplement shall constitute a waiver of any of the conditions set forth in Section 6 hereof.
        (d)  With respect to each sale of Offered Securities, the Company will make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable, but not later than 90 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earning statement in form complying with the provisions of Rule 158 of the 1933 Act Regulations covering a 12-month period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the "effective date" (as defined in such Rule 158) of the Registration Statement.

The Prospectus shall be so furnished promptly following the execution and delivery of the Terms Agreement. All other documents shall be so furnished as soon as available.
        (f)    The Company will endeavour, in cooperation with the Underwriters, to arrange for the qualification of the Offered Securities for sale and the determination of their eligibility for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives reasonably designate and will continue such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified.
        (g)  The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to effect the listing of the Offered Securities on the stock exchange specified in the Terms Agreement, if any.

") as the Representatives designate and the preparation of the memoranda relating thereto; for any fees charged by investment rating agencies for the rating of the Offered Securities; for the filing fee incident to any review by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. of the Offered Securities; for the fees and expenses incurred with respect to the listing of the Offered Securities on the stock exchange if any specified in the Terms Agreement; for any travel expenses of the Company's officers and employees and any other expenses of the Company in connection with attending or hosting meetings with prospective purchasers of the Offered Securities and for expenses incurred in distributing preliminary prospectuses, preliminary prospectus supplements and the Prospectus (including any amendments and supplements thereto) to the Underwriters.
        (i)    The Company will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or file with the Commission a registration statement under the Act relating to debt securities issued
or guaranteed by the Company and having a maturity of more than one year from the date of issue, or publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale, pledge, disposition or filing, without the prior written consent of the Representative for a period beginning at the date of the Terms Agreement and ending at the number of days after the Closing Date specified under "Blackout" in the Terms Agreement.
        5.
    Conditions of the Obligations of the Underwriters.
    The obligations of the several Underwriters to purchase and pay for the Offered Securities on the Closing Date will be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company herein, to the accuracy of the statements of Company officers made pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions precedent:
        (a)  On or prior to the date of the Terms Agreement, the Representatives shall have received a letter, dated the date of delivery thereof, of Deloitte & Touche LLP confirming that they are independent public accountants with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Act and the applicable published Rules and Regulations thereunder and stating substantially to the effect that:
          (i)  in their opinion the financial statements and any schedules and any summary of earnings examined by them and included in the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the related published Rules and Regulations thereunder;
        (ii)  they have performed the procedures specified by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for a review of interim financial information as described in Statement of Auditing Standards No. 71, Interim Financial Information, on any unaudited financial statements included in the Registration Statement;
        (iii)  on the basis of the review referred to in clause (ii) above, a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of the Company, inquiries of officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters and other specified procedures, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:
        (A)  the unaudited financial statements, if any, and any summary of earnings included in the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the related published Rules and Regulations or any material modifications should be made to such unaudited financial statements and summary of earnings for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles;
        (B)  if any unaudited "capsule" information is contained in the Prospectus, the unaudited consolidated net sales, net operating income, net income and net income per share amounts or other amounts constituting such "capsule" information and described in such letter do not agree in all material respects with the corresponding amounts set forth in the unaudited consolidated financial statements or were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding amounts in the audited statements of income;
        (C)  at the date of the latest available balance sheet read by such accountants, or at a subsequent specified date not more than three business days prior to the date of such letter, there was any change in the capital stock or any increase or long-term debt of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries or, at the date of the latest available balance sheet read by such accountants, there was any decrease in consolidated net current assets or net assets, as compared with amounts shown on the latest balance sheet included in the Prospectus, in each case in all material respects; or
        (D)  for the period from the closing date of the latest income statement included in the Prospectus to the closing date of the latest available income statement read by such accountants, or to a subsequent specified date not more than three business days prior to the date of such letter, there were any material decreases, as compared with the corresponding period of the previous year and with the period of corresponding length ended the date of the latest income statement included in the Prospectus, in consolidated net sales, net operating income or net income;
except in all cases set forth in clauses (C) and (D) above for changes, increases or decreases which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; and
        (iv)  they have compared specified dollar amounts (or percentages derived from such dollar amounts) and other financial information contained in the Prospectus which are specified by the Representatives (in each case to the extent that such dollar amounts, percentages and other financial information are derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries subject to the internal controls of the Company's accounting system or are derived directly from such records by analysis or computation) with the results obtained from inquiries, a reading of such general accounting records and other procedures specified in such letter and have found such dollar amounts, percentages and other financial information to be in agreement with such results, except as otherwise specified in such letter.
All financial statements and schedules included in material incorporated by reference into the Prospectus shall be deemed included in the Prospectus for purposes of this subsection.
        (b)  The Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission in accordance with the Rules and Regulations and Section 4(a) of these Provisions. No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceedings for that purpose shall have been instituted or, to the knowledge of the Company or any Underwriter, shall be contemplated by the Commission.
        (c)  Subsequent to the execution and delivery of the Terms Agreement, there shall not have occurred (i) any change, or any development or event reasonably likely to involve a prospective change, in the financial condition, business, properties or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as one enterprise which, in the judgment of a majority in interest of the Underwriters including the Representatives, is material and adverse and makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with completion of the public offering or the sale of and payment for the Offered Securities; (ii) any downgrading in the rating of any debt securities of the Company by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act), or any public announcement that any such organization has under surveillance or review its rating of any debt securities of the Company (other than an announcement with positive implications of a possible upgrading, and no implication of a possible downgrading, of such rating); (iii) any change in U.S. or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls as would, in the judgment of a majority in interest of the Underwriters including the Representatives, be likely to prejudice materially the success of the proposed issue, sale or distribution of the Offered Securities, whether in the primary market or in respect of dealings in the secondary market; (iv) any material suspension or material limitation of trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, or any setting of minimum prices for trading on such exchange, or any suspension of trading of any securities of the Company on any exchange or in the over-the-counter market; (v) any banking moratorium declared by U.S. Federal or New York authorities; (vi) any major disruption of settlements of securities or clearance services in the United States or (vii) any attack on, outbreak or escalation of hostilities or act of terrorism involving the United States, any declaration of war by Congress or any other national or international calamity or emergency if, in the judgment of a majority in interest of the Underwriters including the Representatives, the effect of any such attack, outbreak, escalation, act, declaration, calamity or emergency makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with completion of the public offering or the sale of and payment for the Offered Securities.

        (iv)  The execution, delivery and performance of the Indenture and the Terms Agreement (including the Provisions) and the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities and compliance with the terms and provisions thereof, to such counsel's knowledge, will not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, the DGCL, any federal, Illinois or New York ("
Practicing States
") statute, any Practicing States' rule, regulation or order of any Practicing States' governmental agency or body or any Practicing States' court having jurisdiction over the Company or BCC (provided however that enforcement of rights to indemnity and contribution in the Terms Agreement may be limited by federal or state securities laws or principles of public policy), except where such breach, violation or default would not have a Material Adverse Effect, and except such as may be required under the securities or Blue Sky Laws of various states in connection with the offer and sale of the Offered Securities;

        (ii)  To such counsel's knowledge, no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any governmental agency or body or any court is required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Terms Agreement (including the Provisions) in connection with the issuance or sale of the Offered Securities by the Company, except such as have been obtained and made under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such as may be required under state securities laws;
        (iii)  The execution, delivery and performance of the Indenture and the Terms Agreement (including the Provisions) and the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities and compliance with the terms and provisions thereof will not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under (i) to such counsel's knowledge, any statute, any rule, regulation or order of any governmental agency or body or any court having jurisdiction over the Company or any Material Subsidiary of the Company (provided however, that enforcement of rights to indemnity and contribution in the Terms Agreement may be limited by federal or state securities laws or principles of public policy), or any of their properties, (ii) any material agreement or instrument to which the Company or any such Material Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any such Material Subsidiary is bound or to which any of the properties of the Company or any such Material Subsidiary is subject or (iii) under the charter or by-laws of the Company or any Material Subsidiary, except in the case of (i) and (ii) where such breach, violation or default would not have a Material Adverse Effect, and except such as may be required under the securities or Blue Sky Laws of various states in connection with the offer and sale of the Offered Securities; and
        (iv)  The descriptions in the Registration Statement and Prospectus of statutes, legal and governmental proceedings and contracts and other documents are accurate and fairly present the information required to be shown in all material respects; and such counsel does not know of any legal or governmental proceedings required to be described in the Prospectus which are not described as required or of any contracts or documents of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement which are not described and filed as required.

    Indemnification and Contribution.
    (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in the Terms Agreement.
        (b)  Each Underwriter will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any
such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described in the Terms Agreement.
        (c)  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under subsection (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided further that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of an indemnified party.
        (d)  If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
        (e)  The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who has
signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
        7.
    Default of Underwriters.
    If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Offered Securities under the Terms Agreement on the Closing Date and the aggregate principal amount of Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of Offered Securities that the Underwriters are obligated to purchase on the Closing Date, the Representatives may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments under the Terms Agreement, to purchase the Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on the Closing Date. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount of Offered Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount of Offered Securities that the Underwriters are obligated to purchase on the Closing Date and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, the Terms Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 8. As used in these Provisions, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
        8.
    Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations.
    The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to the Terms Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Offered Securities. If the Terms Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7 or if for any reason the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 4 and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 6 shall remain in effect, and if any Offered Securities have been purchased hereunder the representations and warranties in Section 2 and all obligations under Section 4 shall also remain in effect. If the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of the termination of the Terms Agreement pursuant to Section 7 or the occurrence of any event specified in clause (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) or (vii) of Section 5(c), the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of outside counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities.
        9.
    Certain Agreements of the Underwriters.
    Each of the Underwriters agrees that it will not offer, sell, or deliver any of the Offered Securities, directly or indirectly, or distribute the Prospectus or any other offering material relating to the Offered Securities, in or from any jurisdiction except under circumstances that will, to the best of its knowledge and belief, result in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations and which will not impose any obligations on the Company except as set forth in the Terms Agreement (including the Provisions).
        10.
    Notices.
    All communications hereunder will be in writing and, if sent to the Underwriters, will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to them at their address furnished to the Company in writing for the purpose of communications hereunder, or, if sent to the Company, will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to it at The Boeing Company, 100 North Riverside Plaza, Chicago, Illinois 60606, Attention: James C. Johnson, Senior Vice President, Assistant General Counsel and Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 6 will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to such Underwriter.
        11.
    Successors.
    The Terms Agreement (including the Provisions) will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 6, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder.
        12.

    The Representatives will act for the several Underwriters in connection with the financing described in the Terms Agreement, and any action under such Terms Agreement (including the Provisions) taken by the Representatives will be binding upon all the Underwriters.
        13.

"The statements made in the Prospectus under the caption "Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences", insofar as they constitute summaries of matters of United States federal tax law and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, are accurate summaries of the matters described therein in all material respects."
Section 5(d)(vii) of the Underwriting Provisions is hereby amended in its entirety as follows:
"The Registration Statement, as of its effective date, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, as of the date of the Terms Agreement, and any amendment or supplement thereto, as of its date (in each case excluding the documents incorporated or included by reference therein), complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act, the Trust Indenture Act and the Rules and Regulations; each of the documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, at the time it became effective or was filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the Rules and Regulations; it being understood that such counsel need express no opinion as to the financial statements and schedules or other financial or statistical data derived from the Company's accounting records or as to the statement of eligibility on Form T-1 contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and that such counsel need express no opinion as to any financial or statistical data covered in the letters delivered by Deloitte & Touche LLP pursuant to Section 5(a) and Section 5(h) hereof;"
        The paragraph following Section 5(d)(vii) of the Underwriting Provisions is hereby amended in its entirety as follows:
"Such counsel shall also state that it has no reason to believe (which belief shall not constitute an opinion) that the Registration Statement, as of its effective date, as of the date of the Terms Agreement or as of the Closing Date, or any amendment thereto, as of its date or as of the Closing Date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus, as of the date of the Terms Agreement or as of the Closing Date, or any amendment or supplement thereto, as of its date or as of the Closing Date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; it being understood that such counsel need express no opinion as to the financial statements and schedules or other financial or statistical data derived from the Company's accounting records or as to the statement of eligibility on Form T-1 contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and that such counsel need express no opinion as to any financial or statistical data covered in the letters delivered by Deloitte & Touche LLP pursuant to Section 5(a) and Section 5(h) hereof."
        For purposes of Section 6 of the Underwriting Provisions, the only information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter for use in the Prospectus consists of the following information in the Prospectus furnished on behalf of each Underwriter: the concession and reallowance figures appearing in the third paragraph, the second and third sentence of the fifth paragraph, the seventh paragraph and the thirteenth paragraph under the caption "Underwriting" in the prospectus supplement.
        Each Underwriter represents and agrees that it and each of its affiliates:
 - 
has not offered or sold and, prior to the date six months after the date of issue of the Offered Securities, will not offer or sell any of the Offered Securities to persons in the United Kingdom except to persons whose ordinary activities involve them in acquiring, holding, managing or disposing of investments (as principal or agent) for the purposes of their businesses or otherwise in circumstances which have not resulted and will not result in an offer to the public in the United Kingdom within the meaning of the Public Offers of Securities Regulations 1995 or the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000;
 - 
has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the Offered Securities in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 does not apply to the Company; and

Principal and Interest

THE BOEING COMPANY, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein called the "Company", which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum of THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ($300,000,000) on February 15, 2013 (the "Maturity Date"), and to pay interest thereon from February 11, 2003, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 in each year (each an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing August 15, 2003, at the rate of 5/% per annum until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360 day year of twelve 30 day months. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date and on the Maturity Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Holder in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the first day of February or the first day of August (each "Regular Record Date"), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as applicable. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Holder in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee under the Indenture, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Notes of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid on a specified date in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture. Interest payable on this Note on any Interest Payment Date and on the Maturity Date, as the case may be, will be the amount of interest accrued from and including the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date (or from and including February 11, 2003, in the case of the initial Interest Payment Date) to but excluding the applicable Interest Payment date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be. If an Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment will be made on the next Business Day as if it were made on the date the payment was due, and no interest will accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after that Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be. A "Business Day" means any day which is not a Saturday or Sunday or any day on which banking institutions are authorized or obligated by applicable law or regulation to close in the place in which payment on the Notes is required, as the case may be.

 - 
100% of the principal amount of this Note to be redeemed, together with any accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date; or

 - 
the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue; provided that if no maturity is within three months before or after the maturity date for the Notes, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from those yields on a straight line basis rounding to the nearest month; or
 - 
if that release, or any successor release, is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for that redemption date.
        The Treasury Rate will be calculated by the Company on the third business day preceding the redemption date.
        "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that

        "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Company, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue, expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount, quoted in writing to the Company by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York City time on the third business day preceding such redemption date.
        "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and one other treasury dealer selected by the Company, and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer, which the Company refers to as a "Primary Treasury Dealer," the Company will substitute therefor another nationally recognized investment banking firm that is a Primary Treasury Dealer.
        "Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to each Note to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal thereof and interest thereon that would be due after the related redemption date but for such redemption; provided, however, that, if such redemption date is not an Interest Payment Date with respect to such Note, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment thereon will be deemed to be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such redemption date.
        On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or any portion thereof called for redemption, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest. On or before the redemption date, the Company will deposit with the Paying Agent, or the Trustee, money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the Notes to be redeemed on such date. If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata by the Trustee or by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that a partial redemption must be in an amount not less than $1,000,000 principal amount of Notes.

        (10) in the case of any combination of the above items.

        (1)  to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely by reason of the Holder, or a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of the Holder if the Holder is an estate, trust, partnership or corporation, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a fiduciary Holder, being considered as:
        (a)  being or having been present or engaged in a trade or business in the United States or having had a permanent establishment in the United States;
        (b)  having a current or former relationship with the United States, including a relationship as a citizen or resident of the United States;

        (d)  being or having been a "10-percent shareholder" of the Company as defined in section 871(h)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code and the Regulations that may be promulgated thereunder; or
        (e)  being a bank receiving payments on an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business;
        (2)  to any Holder that is not the sole beneficial owner of the Notes, or a portion of the Notes, or that is a fiduciary, partnership or entity treated as a partnership or disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for United States federal income tax purposes, but only to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary, a beneficial owner or member of the partnership or entity treated as a partnership or disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for United States federal income tax purposes would not have been entitled to the payment of an Additional Amount had the beneficiary, settlor, beneficial owner or member received directly its beneficial or distributive share of the payment;
        (3)  to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed otherwise or withheld solely by reason of a failure of the Holder or any other person to comply with certification, identification or information reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the United States of the Holder or beneficial owner of the Notes, if compliance is required by statute or by regulation of the United States Treasury Department or by an applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (and with respect to which the Holder is entitled to benefits) as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
        (4)  to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge which is imposed or payable otherwise than by withholding by the Company or the Paying Agent from the payment;
        (5)  to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, wealth or personal property tax or similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
        (6)  to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge required to be withheld by any paying agent from any payment of principal of or interest on any Notes, if such payment can be made without such withholding by any other paying agent;
        (7)  to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge required to be made pursuant to any European Union Directive on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive;
        (8)  to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge required to be withheld by any paying agent from any payment in respect of any Note, if such payment can be made without withholding by another paying agent in a member state of the European Union;
        (9)  to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely by reason of a change in law, regulation or administrative or judicial interpretation that becomes effective more than 15 days after the payment becomes due or is duly provided for, whichever occurs later; or
        (10) in the case of any combination of the above items.
        The Notes are subject in all cases to any tax, fiscal or other law or regulation or administrative or judicial interpretation applicable to the Notes. Except as specifically provided, the Company shall not be required to make any payment with respect to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by any government or a political subdivision or taxing authority of or in any government or political subdivision.

        If, as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated under the laws) of the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority of or in the United States), or any change in, or amendments to, an official position regarding the application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, which change or amendment is announced or becomes effective on or after February 6, 2003, the Company becomes, or based upon a written opinion of independent counsel selected by the Company, will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Notes, then the Company may at its option redeem, in whole, but not in part, the Notes on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior notice, at the redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, together with interest accrued but unpaid on the Notes to the date fixed for redemption.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
        We have served as counsel for The Boeing Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (SEC File No. 333-99509) (the "Registration Statement") previously declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to debt securities in a maximum aggregate offering price of $1,000,000,000 (the "Securities"), all of which Securities may be offered and sold by the Company from time to time as set forth in the prospectus filed as part of the Registration Statement (the "Prospectus"), and as to be set forth in one or more supplements to the Prospectus. This opinion letter is rendered in connection with the offering by the Company of $600,000,000 principal amount of its 5/% Notes due February 15, 2013 and $400,000,000 principal amount of its 6/% Notes due February 15, 2033 (collectively the "Notes") as described in a Prospectus Supplement dated February 6, 2003. This opinion letter is furnished to you at your request to enable the Company to continue to fulfill the requirements of Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K, 17 C.F.R. 229.601(b)(5), in connection with the Registration Statement.

        We have examined and relied and base our opinion on originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the following documents and records and upon such matters of law as we have deemed necessary for the purposes of this opinion.
1.
An executed copy of the Registration Statement and a copy of the Prospectus dated September 20, 2002 and Prospectus Supplement dated February 6, 2003 (the "Prospectus Supplement").
2.
The Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the "Certificate"), as certified by the Assistant Secretary of the Company on the date hereof as then being complete, accurate and in effect.
3.
The Bylaws of the Company, as amended to date, as certified by the Secretary of the Company on the date hereof as then being complete, accurate and in effect.
4.
Resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company adopted during meetings on August 25-27, 2002 relating to the filing of the Registration Statement and related matters, and of the Pricing Committee established thereunder adopted on February 6, 2003 relating to the offering of the Notes, each as certified by the Secretary of the Company on the date hereof as then being complete, accurate and in effect.
5.
The Underwriting Provisions dated February 6, 2003, the terms of which are incorporated by reference into the related Terms Agreement dated February 6, 2003 by and among the Company and Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (collectively, the "Purchase Agreement").
        The opinions set forth herein are qualified as stated therein and are qualified further by the following:
        (a)  This opinion is based upon existing laws, ordinances and regulations in effect as of the date hereof and as they presently apply.
        (b)  We express no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any state or jurisdiction other than the States of Illinois and New York, the Delaware General Corporation Law and the laws of the United States of America upon the transactions described herein.
        (c)  In rendering the opinions set forth below, we have relied, to the extent we believe appropriate, as to matters of fact, (i) upon certificates or statements of public officials and of the officers of the Company, and (ii) upon representations and warranties contained in the Purchase Agreement and the Registration Statement, and we have made no independent investigation or verification of said facts. No opinion is being expressed as to the effect of any event, fact or circumstance of which we have no actual knowledge.
        (d)  We have assumed the competency of the signatories to the Purchase Agreement, the global certificates representing the Notes and certain officers certificates, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies, and the accuracy and completeness of all records made available to us.
        (e)  We have assumed that (i) the Purchase Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the parties thereto (other than the Company), is within their corporate, trust, limited liability company or partnership power, and are their legal, valid and binding obligation(s) and that it is in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations governing the conduct of their respective businesses and this transaction, (ii) the Purchase Agreement will be enforced in circumstances and in a manner which is commercially reasonable, (iii) the parties to the Purchase Agreement (other than the Company), are not subject to any statute, rule or regulation or any impediment that requires them or the Company to obtain the consent, or to make any declaration or filing with any governmental authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, and (iv) all terms, provisions and conditions relating to the transaction referred to in this opinion letter are correctly and completely reflected in the Purchase Agreement.
        (f)    The opinions hereafter expressed are qualified to the extent that: (i) the characterization of, and the enforceability of any rights or remedies in, any agreement or instrument may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, equitable subordination, or similar laws and doctrines affecting the rights of creditors generally and general equitable principles; (ii) the availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy is subject to the discretion of a court of competent jurisdiction; and (iii) the provisions of any document, agreement or instrument that (a) may require indemnification or contribution for liabilities under the provisions of any Federal or state securities laws or in respect to the neglect or wrongful conduct of the indemnified party or its representatives or agents, (b) purport to confer, waive or consent to the jurisdiction of any court, or (c) waive any right granted by common or statutory law, may be unenforceable as against public policy; and (iv) any provisions of the Purchase Agreement granting so-called "self-help" or extrajudicial remedies may not be enforceable.
        (g)  Requirements in the Purchase Agreement specifying that provisions thereof may only be waived in writing may not be valid, binding or enforceable to the extent that an oral agreement or an implied agreement by trade practice or course of conduct has been created modifying any provision of such documents.
        (h)  Whenever our opinion, with respect to the existence or absence of facts, is qualified by the phrase "to our knowledge" or a phrase of similar import, it indicates that during the course of our representation of the Company in connection with the subject transaction no information has come to the attention of our attorneys who have worked on the subject transaction which would give us current actual knowledge of the existence or absence of such facts. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is expressly understood
that no opinion is expressed with regard to: (a) the financial ability of the Company to meet its obligations under either the Senior Indenture dated February 1, 2003 between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank (the "Indenture") relating to the Notes or the Purchase Agreement; (b) although we are not aware of any untruthfulness or inaccuracy, the truthfulness or accuracy of any applications, reports, plans, documents, financial statements or other matters furnished to the purchasers by (or on behalf of) the Company in connection with the Indenture, the Purchase Agreement or the Registration Statement; or (c) although we are not aware of any untruthfulness or inaccuracy, the truthfulness or accuracy of any representations or warranties made by the Company in the Indenture, the Purchase Agreement or the Registration Statement or other documents described herein, which are not the subject of any of the opinions stated herein. However, except to the extent expressly set forth herein, we have not undertaken any independent investigation to determine the existence or absence of such facts, and no inference as to our knowledge of the existence or absence of such facts should be drawn from the fact of our representation of the Company or any other matter.
        (i)    We have examined the latest compilations that are available to us of the applicable statutes of such jurisdictions that relate to the issuance of the Notes and, in certain instances, the written regulations and rulings issued thereunder. We have not obtained special written rulings of the SEC, state securities commissions or other administrative bodies or officials charged with the administration of such statutes, regulations and rulings and we have not obtained and do not rely on opinions of other counsel.
        Based upon the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, but subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications expressed herein, we are of the opinion that, as of the date hereof, following issuance of the Notes pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement and receipt by the Company of the consideration for the Notes specified in the resolutions of the Company's Board of Directors and the Pricing Committee referred to above, the Notes will be validly issued and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer, or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity) and except that a waiver of rights under any usury law may be unenforceable.
        We assume no obligation to advise you of any changes in the foregoing subsequent to the delivery of this opinion letter. This opinion letter has been prepared solely for your use in connection with the filing by the Company of a Current Report on Form 8-K on the date of this opinion letter, which Form 8-K will be incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement. This opinion letter should not be quoted in whole or in part or otherwise be referred to, nor filed with or furnished to any governmental agency or other person or entity, without the prior written consent of this firm.
        We hereby consent (i) to be named in the Registration Statement, and in the Prospectus, as attorneys who will pass upon the legality of the Securities to be sold thereunder and (ii) to the filing of this opinion as an Exhibit to the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are an "expert" within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
