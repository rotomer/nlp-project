Item 5. Other Events
On December 19, 2003, The Boeing Company ("Boeing") announced its intention to unconditionally guaranty the outstanding bonds $250,000,000 6 7/8% due November 1, 2006 and $350,000,000 9 3/4% due April 1, 2012 of McDonnell Douglas Corporation.
Boeing has also agreed to enter into a support agreement with its wholly owned subsidiary, Boeing Capital Corporation ("BCC") under which Boeing would agree to maintain a minimum ownership interest in BCC and to make payments to BCC should its fixed charge coverage ratio or net worth fall below minimum levels. The support agreement will include provisions under which it may be modified or terminated, with appropriate safeguards for BCC's noteholders. Boeing and BCC have agreed that a support agreement is appropriate in view of the previously announced new strategy under which BCC will focus primarily on supporting Boeing products and services.
