Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement On February 22, 2005, The Boeing Company ("Boeing") entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Mid-Western Aircraft Systems, Inc. ("Mid-Western"), an indirect majority-owned subsidiary of Onex Partners LP. Under the Purchase Agreement Boeing has agreed to sell, and Mid-Western has agreed to buy, substantially all of the assets related to the airplane components business of Boeing's Commercial Airplanes operating segment, which designs, manufactures and supports structural components (including spare parts) for commercial airplanes and manufactures components for certain military platforms at facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma (collectively, the "Business"). Transaction consideration to Boeing includes approximately $900 million cash, the transfer of certain liabilities and entry into long-term supply agreements that Boeing expects to provide ongoing cost savings. Boeing will retain certain liabilities associated with the Business. Mid-Western's obligation to complete the purchase under the Purchase Agreement is subject to several conditions, including without limitation the following requirements: o all required governmental and third party consents to transfer have been obtained, including applicable antitrust approvals; o Mid-Western receives the proceeds of its debt financing in substantially the amount and form described in its financing commitments; and o the successful negotiation of collective bargaining agreements by Mid-Western. The cash purchase price for the Business will be approximately $900 million and is subject to certain post-closing adjustments, including, without limitation, changes in the working capital of the Business and certain investments made by Boeing. Boeing expects to recognize a non-cash loss on the transaction attributable to the transfer of pension-related assets and liabilities. Recognizing these non-cash charges at closing will reduce future pension expenses. The Purchase Agreement contemplates that Boeing and Mid-Western will enter into a number of long-term supply agreements and license agreements at or prior to the closing of the purchase (including with respect to Boeing's 787 aircraft program), pursuant to which Mid-Western will provide certain parts and services on an exclusive basis to Boeing, as well as a transition services agreement. The Purchase Agreement also includes a covenant by Boeing during the term of those supply agreements not to compete with Mid-Western in the manufacture of certain products subject to those supply agreements. The Purchase Agreement also contemplates that Boeing will provide Mid-Western with a $150 million subordinated, secured non-revolving line of credit which shall contain customary terms and covenants for a credit line of this type. Certain statements in this Report contain "forward-looking" information (as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995), which involve risk and uncertainty. These include statements reflecting Boeing's expectations that the sale to Mid-Western of the assets of the Business as provided for in the Purchase Agreement will be completed, that it will recognize a non-cash loss on the transaction and that the long-term supply agreements will provide Boeing with cost savings. These forward-looking statements are not guaranties of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based on assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those we express or forecast in these forward-looking statements. Boeing undertakes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements in this Report and does not intend to do so.

Exhibit 99.1 WICHITA, Kansas, Feb. 22, 2005 - The Boeing Company [NYSE: BA] and Onex Corporation today announced an agreement under which Onex will acquire the Wichita/Tulsa Division of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. The transaction includes Commercial Airplanes facilities and assets in Wichita, Kansas, and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma. Transaction consideration to Boeing includes approximately $900 million cash, transfer of certain liabilities and long-term supply agreements that provide Boeing ongoing cost savings. The single-source supply agreements cover the structures and parts currently produced by the Wichita/Tulsa Division, providing a stable base of revenue for the new business to build upon. In addition, the Wichita/Tulsa operations will continue as a major partner on the 787 Dreamliner. The sale is expected to close during the second quarter of 2005. Boeing expects to recognize a non-cash loss on the transaction attributable to the transfer of pension related assets and liabilities. Recognizing these non-cash charges at closing will reduce future pension expenses. Boeing Integrated Defense Systems operations in Wichita and Oklahoma are not included in the transaction. "This agreement fully supports our strategy to focus Boeing on large-scale systems integration, which is where we are most competitive and can add the most value to our airplanes and services," said Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and Chief Executive Officer Alan Mulally. "Boeing will benefit from lower procurement costs and the Wichita/Tulsa operations now can grow by winning new business with other customers." Mulally said Boeing selected Onex based on its successful history of investing in and growing companies. Onex will form a new company to operate the facilities. The plants will continue to operate under the leadership of Jeff Turner, currently vice president and general manager of the Boeing Commercial Airplanes Wichita Division, who will be the new company's CEO. "Onex has a strategy to build the most efficient and innovative company in the aerostructures industry. We intend to invest over $1 billion in Kansas and Oklahoma in the next few years," said Seth Mersky, an Onex managing director. Mersky said Onex's vision is to grow the value of the Wichita/Tulsa operations over a number of years. "We are committed to working in close partnership with the current Wichita/Tulsa senior leadership team to make the transition as seamless as possible," added Nigel Wright, another Onex managing director. "The new company will compete for work inside and outside of Boeing, providing potential for more, and more stable, jobs. The key is to get the cost structure right."
Boeing announced in April 2004 that it was studying the possible sale of its plants in Wichita , Tulsa and McAlester . Boeing included balancing the interests of employees, customers, shareholders and its plant communities in its criteria for the decision. "We firmly believe that this decision provides the best available outcome for the Wichita/Tulsa Division and its plant communities by creating new opportunities for sustained growth as a separate operation. Onex shares this perspective, and we look forward to a long and productive relationship together," Mulally said. Approximately 9,000 Commercial Airplanes employees currently work at the Wichita, Tulsa and McAlester sites. The Division incurred approximately US$2.2 billion in annual costs for 2004. The facilities currently supply Boeing with fuselage and other structural components for the 737, 747, 767 and 777 programs, and the division is a supplier partner on the 787 Dreamliner. The transaction is subject to a number of conditions before closing, including U.S. government reviews. Goldman Sachs advised The Boeing Company on this transaction.
