The transaction includes the Company's Commercial Airplanes facilities and assets in Wichita, Kansas, and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma. Boeing Integrated Defense Systems operations in Wichita and Oklahoma are not included in the transaction.

As a result of the transaction, the Company will recognize a substantially non-cash loss of approximately $350 million on a pre-tax basis. Of the approximate $350 million loss, the Company will recognize approximately $100 million in the second quarter of 2005 and the remaining loss relating to estimated pension and post-retirement curtailments and settlement is anticipated to be recognized in the third quarter of 2005.
