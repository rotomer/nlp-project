Boeing Fourth-Quarter Net Income More Than Doubles; EPS Outlook Raised
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 1. Summary Financial Results
 
 
 The Boeing Company [NYSE: BA] today reported significant growth in its fourth-quarter financial performance and provided guidance for 2006 and 2007 emphasizing its expectations for continued growth and margin expansion.
CHICAGO, Feb. 1, 2006
 
Boeing's fourth-quarter net income more than doubled to $460 million, or $0.58 per share, from $186 million, or $0.23, a year ago. Revenue increased 7 percent to $14.2 billion from $13.3 billion while operating margin increased to 3.8 percent from 0.2 percent.
 
For 2005, Boeing's net income increased to $2.6 billion, or $3.20 per share, from $1.9 billion, or $2.30 per share, in 2004. Revenue rose to $54.8 billion from $52.5 billion and operating margin rose to 5.1 percent from 3.8 percent. Revenue in 2005 grew 5 percent despite labor strikes at Commercial Airplanes and the company's launch business that reduced revenue by approximately $2.3 billion.
 
Building on progress made in 2005, Boeing is increasing its earnings per share guidance for 2006 to between $3.25 and $3.45. In 2007, earnings per share is projected to rise approximately 25 percent to between $4.10 and $4.30 on higher deliveries of commercial airplanes and company-wide productivity improvements. Further details on financial guidance are provided below.
 
"Our results and improved outlook reflect a strong commitment to growth, expanding margins and improving how we do business every day," said Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNerney. "As we look ahead, that commitment will be reflected in a continued emphasis on driving results in our core business units and a new focus on a series of growth and productivity initiatives to leverage our capabilities, resources and talent across the entire company."
 
Boeing's fourth-quarter earnings from operations rose to $544 million from $28 million in the same quarter a year ago, and its operating cash flow grew by 80 percent to $2.4 billion. Free cash flow* was $1.9 billion for the quarter after an investment of $0.5 billion in property, plant & equipment (Table 2). For the year, operating earnings grew 40 percent to $2.8 billion and operating cash flow doubled to a record $7.0 billion. Free cash flow* was $5.5 billion, 140 percent higher than last year's $2.3 billion on strong earnings growth and working capital improvements.
 
Table 2. Cash Flow
 
 
Fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.58 includes a reduction of 16 cents for the previously disclosed non-cash pension charge related to the sale of Rocketdyne. Results for the year-ago quarter included a tax benefit of 12 cents per share and charges totaling 44 cents per share related to the U.S. Air Force 767 Tanker program and to complete 717 production. Without these items, adjusted earnings per share* would have been 74 cents in fourth quarter 2005 and 55 cents in the same quarter last year. Reconciliations of GAAP earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share are appended to this release.
 
Boeing's backlog at year end was a record $202 billion, up 19 percent from the end of the third quarter and 33 percent for the year. That growth primarily reflects the more than 1,000 commercial airplane orders received during the year.
 
Boeing's cash and investments in marketable securities totaled $8.4 billion at year end, up from $7.5 billion at the end of the third quarter (Table 3) and from $6.1 billion at the end of 2004. This reflected strong operating cash flow partially offset by the ongoing share repurchase program, pension plan contributions, and planned investment increases in Boeing's core businesses. The company repurchased 12.4 million shares during the quarter for $832 million and 45.2 million shares for $2.9 billion during the entire year, leaving 24.3 million shares available under the existing repurchase authorization. The company made no discretionary contributions to its pension plans during the quarter; contributions for all of 2005 totaled $1.9 billion. The funded status of the Company's pension plans improved to 96 percent in 2005.
 
The Boeing Company debt was unchanged from the end of the third quarter at $3.9 billion. Boeing Capital debt declined slightly to $6.2 billion as strong operating cash flow eliminated the need for new financing.

Segment Results
 
Commercial Airplanes
 
Boeing Commercial Airplanes' contractual backlog rose 37 percent during the quarter and 89 percent for the full year to $124 billion, reflecting 388 gross orders during the quarter  including 18 that launched the 747-8 program  and 1,029 for the year. From the 787 Dreamliner program launch to the end of 2005, 27 customers had booked a total of 379 orders and commitments for the new airplane, including 291 firm orders.
 
Revenues for the fourth quarter increased 8 percent to $5.9 billion on higher airplane deliveries, a favorable model mix and higher spares revenue (Table 4). Operating margins were 5.6 percent, reflecting higher revenues partially offset by planned increases in research and development expense. The tanker and 717 related items mentioned above led to a negative operating margin for 2004's fourth quarter. Airplane deliveries totaled 73 units, eight fewer than originally planned due to residual effects of the September labor strike, which reduced results by an estimated 8 cents in the quarter.
 
For the year, revenues rose 8 percent to $22.7 billion on higher deliveries, increased spares and services sales, and higher used aircraft sales. Deliveries for the year totaled 290 airplanes. Operating earnings grew 90 percent to $1.4 billion.
 
Table 4. Commercial Airplanes Operating Results
 
 
Integrated Defense Systems
 
Boeing Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) revenues increased 7 percent in the quarter to $8.1 billion due to strong growth in Aircraft & Weapon Systems and Support Systems segments (Table 5). Operating margins increased to 11.4 percent from 8.9 percent driven by double-digit performance in these segments. A strike at IDS's launch business and lower revenue from proprietary programs reduced fourth-quarter revenue by nearly $700 million below previous expectations.
 
For the year, IDS achieved record revenue, earnings and margins. Revenues rose 1 percent to $30.8 billion, operating earnings rose 33 percent to $3.9 billion, and operating margins increased to 12.6 percent, up from 9.6 percent a year ago. Full year operating earnings include a pre-tax gain of $569 million from the sale of Rocketdyne, without which IDS's operating margin would have been an industry-leading 10.8%.
 
Aircraft & Weapon Systems revenues increased 18 percent to $3.1 billion for the quarter, primarily due to the delivery mix and timing of C-17 and other aircraft programs. Operating margins were 16.5 percent driven by strong performance across key programs including C-17, F/A-18 and Rotorcraft.
 
Network Systems revenues declined to $2.9 billion on lower volume on Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Homeland Security and Proprietary programs that was partially offset by increased activity in Future Combat Systems (FCS) and Airborne Command & Control programs. Operating margins fell to 5.7 percent, as lower missile defense and Airborne Early Warning & Control earnings from revised cost and fee estimates offset higher earnings from programs with increased revenues identified above.
 
Table 5. Integrated Defense Systems Operating Results
 
 
Support Systems revenues rose 14 percent to $1.6 billion driven by increased volume in Integrated Support Services for Special Operations Forces, C-17, C-130 and F-15K. Operating margins were 14.2 percent, up from 13.2 percent during the same period in 2004.
 
Launch and Orbital Systems revenues declined 18 percent to $0.5 billion due primarily to the strike affecting the launch business during the quarter. Operating margins rose to 4.2 percent due to higher contract values for Delta IV launch contracts in 2005 and revised cost and fee estimates in 2004.
 
As previously announced, IDS is reorganizing into 3 new business segments. This new structure will more effectively address evolving customer requirements for capability-driven solutions and improve productivity.
 
IDS's total backlog continues to be the largest in the industry at $77.6 billion. Contractual backlog grew to $37.9 billion, up from $35.5 billion at the end of the third quarter. Unobligated backlog was $39.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Total IDS backlog, comprised of contractual and unobligated, was down 1 percent from the end of the third quarter and down 10 percent from a year earlier.
 
Boeing Capital Corporation
 
Boeing Capital Corporation (BCC) continued to support the operations of Boeing's business units and reduce portfolio risk. Revenues for the fourth quarter grew 5 percent to $238 million on favorable dispositions and restructurings. Pre-tax income rose 14 percent to $40 million on higher revenues and lower asset impairment charges.
 
For the year, pre-tax income grew 27 percent (Table 6). BCC's year-end portfolio balance was $9.2 billion, unchanged from the end of the third quarter and down $0.5 billion for the year as normal portfolio run-off and depreciation more than offset new business volume. BCC contributed $120 million in cash dividends to the company during the quarter and $338 million for the year. BCC recorded leverage of 5.0-to-1, as measured by the ratio of debt-to-equity.

Additional Information
 
The "Other" segment consists primarily of Boeing Technology and Connexion by Boeing
SM
, as well as certain results related to the consolidation of all business units. For the fourth quarter, losses from operations narrowed to $60 million from $162 million last year, due primarily to lower expenses in Boeing Technology in 2005 and asset write-downs in 2004.
 
Pre-tax (non-cash) pension expense for the quarter was $451 million, up $330 million or $0.26 per share from the same period of 2004. This includes a pre-tax, non-cash pension charge of $228 million from the Rocketdyne sale. Share-based-plans expense was $160 million, up $33 million from the same period of 2004. Deferred stock compensation expense was $50 million, or $0.04 per share, as Boeing's stock price rose during the period.
 
Outlook
 
The company is forecasting solid growth in 2006 and 2007 that reflects continued strong performance from its core businesses, higher commercial airplane deliveries and productivity gains across the company. (Table 7).
 
Boeing's 2006 revenue is expected to be approximately $60 billion, which is below prior estimates due solely to a previously disclosed accounting change in our commercial airplane business. Revenue guidance for 2007 is established at $63.5 billion to $64.5 billion.
 
Earnings per share guidance for 2006 is being increased to between $3.25 and $3.45, from $3.10 to $3.30 previously forecasted, due to better operating performance and a lower deferred tax charge in the first quarter of 2006 than previously expected. This new outlook indicates an increase of approximately 5% over 2005, on GAAP basis, and approximately 40% over 2005 adjusted earnings per share* of 2.39. Boeing expects further EPS growth in 2007, with guidance of between $4.10 and $4.30 per share.
 
The company is maintaining its 2006 operating cash flow guidance at greater than $5.5 billion, and is setting its 2007 operating cash flow guidance at greater than $5.5 billion.
 
As noted above, Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) is changing its method of accounting for supplier concession sharing agreements beginning in 2006. It will no longer record concession reimbursements received from suppliers as "Sales and other operating revenues." Instead those will be reflected as a reduction to "Cost of products and services." This accounting change reduced BCA's 2006 revenue guidance by nearly $2 billion, but had only a nominal impact on expected operating earnings. Guidance for 2006 and 2007 now includes this change.
 
The guidance does not include the impact of the pending United Launch Alliance (ULA) transaction. Launch & Orbital Systems revenue guidance for 2006 includes approximately $1 billion for business planned to be part of ULA. Upon completion of the transaction, Boeing will use the equity method of accounting for this new joint venture, recognizing Boeing's proportionate share of the venture's earnings in the Launch & Orbital Systems segment.
 
The commercial airplane outlook is very strong. The 2006 delivery forecast remains approximately 395 airplanes, 36 percent higher than in 2005, while 2007
 
deliveries are expected to increase to between 440 and 445 airplanes. BCA revenue for 2006 is expected to be approximately $27.5 billion, with operating margins greater than 9 percent, while revenue for 2007 is expected to be between $29.5 billion to $30.5 billion, with operating margins greater than 10 percent. The 2006 delivery forecast is completely sold out while the forecast for 2007 is more than 92 percent sold out.
 
IDS revenues for 2006 are expected to be approximately $31.5 billion, with operating margins of approximately 10.5 percent. For 2007, IDS expects 2 to 5 percent revenue growth and operating margins above 10.5 percent.
 
Within IDS, Aircraft & Weapon Systems expects revenues of approximately $12.5 billion and operating margins of approximately 13 percent in 2006, with a stable outlook for 2007 and operating margins continuing in the low double-digit range. Network Systems expects revenues of approximately $10.5 billion and margins of approximately 8 percent, with a moderate growth outlook for 2007. Support Systems expects revenue to be approximately $6 billion in 2006 with operating margins of about 13 percent, with moderate revenue growth in 2007 and operating margins continuing in the low double-digit range. Launch & Orbital Systems expects 2006 revenues of about $2.5 billion and operating margins of about 2 percent, with a stable outlook for 2007.
 
IDS is reorganizing into 3 new segments: Precision Engagement and Mobility Systems, Networks and Space Systems, and Support Systems. We expect to begin reporting through these new segments when we report financial results for the first quarter of 2006.
 
Boeing's research and development investment is expected to be between $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion in 2006 and between $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion in 2007, reflecting continued investment in planned product development programs. Annual capital expenditures should be approximately $1.6 billion in 2006 and $1.5 billion in 2007.
 
The company's non-cash pension expense is expected to be approximately $1 billion for 2006 and for 2007. Pension cash funding is expected to be approximately $500 million in each of those years. The company will continue to evaluate making additional discretionary contributions to its pension plans.

Non-GAAP Measure Disclosure
 
Management believes that the non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) measures (indicated by an asterisk *) used in this report provide investors with important perspectives into the company's ongoing business performance. The company does not intend for the information to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measure. Other companies may define the measure differently. The following definitions are provided for free cash flow and adjusted earnings per share.
 
Free Cash Flow
 
Free cash flow is defined as GAAP operating cash flow less capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, additions. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for shareholders, debt repayment, and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long term value creation. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt. Management uses free cash flow internally to assess both business performance and overall liquidity. Table 2 provides a reconciliation between GAAP operating cash flow and free cash flow.
 
Adjusted earnings per share
 
Adjusted earnings per share is defined as diluted earnings per share computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles adjusted for certain significant charges or credits. Management believes adjusted earnings per share are important to understanding the company's on-going operations and provide additional insights into underlying business performance. Significant charges or credits are described in the attachments to this release which provide reconciliations between GAAP earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share.
