In addition to the amendments related to Code Section 409A, the Board amended the SBP to: (1) provide that, beginning in 2009, participants will be permitted to elect to invest their account balances among the same array of funds (other than the Boeing Stock Fund and the Stable Value Fund) as the funds available under the DCP and the Company's Voluntary Investment Plan, a 401(k) retirement savings plan (the "VIP"), in addition to the current interest crediting method; and (2) set the deferral election rate to the maximum permissible percentage that an employee can elect to contribute under the VIP.

Specified Employee

Unforeseeable Emergency
 
An Eligible Employee will become a Participant when he or she elects to defer his or her Base Salary, Annual Incentive Award or Performance Award by filing a timely Deferral Election in accordance with Section 4 below.
 
in the case of Base Salary, the percentage of the Participant's Base Salary (but not more than 50% thereof) to be deferred in each regular pay period, by December 1 to be effective for the following Plan Year, and
in the case of Annual Incentive Awards payable in cash, the percentage of the Annual Incentive Award to be deferred (which shall be all or any portion thereof), by December 1 of the year preceding the performance period for such Annual Incentive Award, and
in the case of Performance Awards, the percentage of the Performance Award to be deferred (which shall be all or any portion thereof), by December 1 of the year preceding the year of grant.
A Deferral Election will remain in effect until changed with respect to future Deferrals by a filing a new Deferral Election with the Company increasing or decreasing the percentage of future Base Salary, Annual Incentive Awards, or Performance Awards to be deferred. Any such change in Deferral Election must be made by December 1 of the year for which new elections of the same type are due and shall supersede any election previously made. All previous Deferral Elections for Boeing Stock Unit (BSU) grants, Performance Share grants and related Earnings Credit method elections made prior to January 1, 2008, will continue in effect until such time as the grants are vested or forfeited, as appropriate.
An Employee who becomes an Eligible Employee during the Plan Year (as a new hire, rehire or due to raise or promotion) will not be eligible to participate during such Plan Year. In the case of an Employee who ceases to be an Eligible Employee during the Plan Year (e.g., due to a reclassification as other than E-Series Payroll or Separation from Service) the Employee's Deferral Election shall remain in effect with respect to Deferral
 
Elections of Base Salary, Annual Incentive Awards and Performance Awards in effect with respect to the Plan Year in which the Employee ceases to be an Eligible Employee, but will automatically be cancelled with respect to future Deferrals (i.e., Deferrals for subsequent Plan Years).
Notwithstanding the election procedures described above, a Participant will be permitted to cancel an existing Deferral Election of Base Salary with regard to a Plan Year during that Plan Year, where the Participant incurs an Unforeseeable Emergency, as determined by the Committee. To the extent that a Participant has elected and received a distribution due to an Unforeseeable Emergency under Section 7(G), the Participant will be deemed to have elected to cancel his or her Base Salary Deferral Election for the remainder of the applicable Plan Year.
If a Participant ceases to be an Eligible Employee or ceases to have a Deferral election on file (in accordance with Section 4), all amounts accumulated in the Participant's account prior to termination will continue to be held subject to the Plan.
 
 
Effective with respect to amounts deferred on or after January 1, 2006 (including amounts for which Deferral Elections were made prior to January 1, 2006) the Company will no longer provide any Matching Contribution under this Section 5 on any Deferrals into a Boeing Stock Fund account; provide that in the case of Deferrals that were the subject of a Deferral Election into a Boeing Stock Fund account made prior to January 1, 2005, the Company will continue to match such Deferrals of Boeing Stock Units and Performance Share Awards that are not yet vested (upon vesting) and such Deferrals of 2005 Annual Incentive Awards that were paid in 2006. To the extent that the Company makes or has made a Matching Contribution with respect to all or part of any amounts deferred under this Plan, each such Matching Contribution shall be deferred together with the Participant Deferral to which it relates, and shall be subject to all of the Participant elections (including default elections) with respect to such Deferral.
 
Any Matching Contribution made pursuant to this Section 5 shall be canceled and forfeited if the Participant Separates from Service for any reason other than retirement under a retirement plan sponsored by the Company, disability as determined by the Company, layoff, or death. The forfeited Matching Contribution (and any Earnings Credits that would have accrued but for the forfeiture) will be reinstated upon rehire, only where (i) the Participant's Separation from Service occurred while the Participant was on an Authorized Period of Absence or due to a reasonably anticipated permanent reduction in the level of services performed by the Participant to less than 50 percent of the average level of services performed by the Participant during the immediately preceding 36-month period, and (ii) the Participant's Separation from Service was deemed a Separation from Service under Code section 409A or the terms of this Plan (i.e., the Participant did
 
not incur a termination of employment with the Controlled Group). Reinstatement of the Participant's forfeited benefits will occur upon (i) return to active employment with the Company within the Authorized Period of Absence, (ii) termination of the Authorized Period of Absence or period of a reduced level of services due to retirement under a plan sponsored by the Company, disability as determined by the Company, layoff or death, or (iii) the Participant's return to active employment at a level of services that is 50 percent or more of the average level of services performed by the Participant prior to his or her prior deemed Separation from Service due to a reduction in services. Such reinstated benefits will remain subject to the forfeiture provisions of the first sentence of this section 5(B) and the payment timing rules under Section 7(A).
 
 
The Committee will establish and maintain an Account for each participant. The Account will be credited with Deferrals, as well as Company Matching Contributions and Earnings Credits as described below. The Account will be reduced as payments are made.
All amounts deferred under the Plan, and any Company Matching Contribution with respect thereto, shall be credited to the Participant's Account at the time at which they would otherwise first have become payable to the Participant or, if earlier, the time at which the Participant's interest in the award becomes vested. Non-cash awards shall be credited to the Participant's account at the time at which they would otherwise first have become distributable to the Participant.
Each Account shall be credited with earnings thereon, under the Interest Fund method the Boeing Stock Fund method, or the Other Investment Funds method, subject to the restrictions on diversification described below, at the election of the Participant. In the absence of an election the Interest Fund method shall be used.
 
 
Interest will be computed during each calendar year at the mean between the high and the low during the first eleven months of the preceding year of yields on Aa-rated industrial Bonds as reported by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., rounded to the nearest 1/4th of one percent. The Company will notify Participants annually of the established interest rate.
 
Each Participant's Boeing Stock Fund Account periodically shall be credited with the number of shares of the Company's common stock that could be purchased, as set forth in the preceding paragraph, with an amount equal to the cash dividends that would be payable on the number of shares of the Company's common stock that equals the number of stock units in a Participant's Boeing Stock Fund account. The Company will notify Participants annually of the number of stock units, and the dividend equivalents, credited to their Boeing Stock Fund account.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Performance Shares that were unvested as of December 31, 2005, and deferred into the Boeing Stock Fund account shall not be eligible for diversification, even upon vesting. Matching contributions (except as described in (vi) above) also shall not be eligible for diversification. Amounts eligible for diversification are sometimes referred to as "transferable amounts" and amounts not eligible for diversification are sometimes referred to as "nontransferable amounts."
 
The Participant may make a separate election for each type of Deferral (Base Salary, Annual Incentive Award and Performance Award) and may change how future Deferrals are invested anytime during the Plan Year. The Participant may also transfer Deferrals eligible for diversification from one fund to another on a daily basis, provided that a Participant may not transfer funds from one investment fund to another and back on the same day.
In addition, transfers cannot be made into the Boeing Stock Fund for 30 calendar days after transferring funds out of the Boeing Stock Fund. This restriction applies regardless of the number of units or the dollar value of the transfer. However, the Participant may continue to direct future Deferrals into the Boeing Stock Fund and make transfers out of this fund at any time, subject to insider trading rules.
 
 
A Participant may elect the form and timing of distribution with regard to his or her entire Account (including future Deferrals, Matching Credits and Earnings Credits) as described below. This distribution election must be made at the same time the Participant makes his or her Deferral Election.
Distribution elections made with regard to a Participant's entire Account may be changed solely to the extent permitted under subsection (B) below.
 
 
The lump sum distribution option is a single lump sum payable in January of any Plan Year following the Participant's Separation from Service. The amount of such distribution will be based on the value of the Participant's Account determined as of the date of payment.
Payment of the lump sum will be made the later of: (i) January of the first Plan Year following Separation from Service, or (ii) January of the first Plan Year following the Participant's attainment of a specified age (subject to (E) below), as elected by the Participant under this Section 7.
 
The installment payment option is a series of annual installment payments for a period between 2 and 15 years. The amount payable to the Participant each year shall be computed by multiplying the balance in the Account (or the applicable portion of the Account) by a fraction, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the number of years remaining in the distribution period on the first day of January of such year.
Prior to January 1, 2006, a Participant could elect that annual installments be determined under the "Approximately Equal" method, under which the amount payable to the Participant each year shall be computed by the Company so that the aggregate amount of cash or stock in a Participant's Account under the Plan shall be distributed in approximately equal installments in each year for which payments are to be made. The Approximately Equal method is only available for payment elections on file as of December 31, 2005.
Annual installment payments will begin the later of: (i) January of the first Plan Year following Separation from Service, or (ii) January of the first Plan Year following the Participant's attainment of a specified age (subject to (E) below), as elected by the Participant under this Section 7. Payments will continue until the full balance in the Participant's Account has been paid.
In the event that no distribution option is elected, the Participant will be deemed to have elected to receive a single lump sum payable in January of the first Plan Year following the Participant's Separation from Service.
 
Effective January 1, 2008, a Participant may change a distribution election with regard to his or her entire Account only once after the initial distribution election is made (subject to (E) below), in accordance with the conditions stated below. To the extent such change would defer commencement of any portion of the Participant's Account beyond both age 70
 1
/
2
and Separation from Service, the change will not be effective with respect to such portion.
 
 
 
In no event can installment payments be revoked once they have begun.
Prior to January 1, 2008, a Participant may change a distribution election with regard to his or her entire Account, in accordance with procedures established by the Committee, without the restrictions stated above. Any changes made under this paragraph will be invalid to the extent they affect distributions scheduled for the Plan Year in which the change is made.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing subsections (A) and (B), for Participants who terminates employment on or after January 1, 2006, the Participant may make a separate election under (A) above as to the time and form of distribution of (i) the Participants Company Matching Contributions and (ii) the balance of the Participant's Plan Account. Such a Participant may also make a separate one-time distribution election change under (B) above with respect to each such separate election under this (C).
 
If a Participant makes a separate election under (C)(ii) above to receive the balance of the Participant's Plan Account in annual installment payments, the Participant may further elect to receive either:
 
 
 
Payment of benefits under this Plan will begin not later than the first January following the calendar year in which the Participant both attains (or would have attained) age 70
 1
/
2
and is Separated from Service. Payment of benefits for Participants actively employed beyond age 70
 1
/
2
will begin no later than the first January following the calendar year in which the Participant Separates from Service. In the event that no distribution option is elected under (A) above, the Participant will be deemed to have elected to receive a single lump sum distribution.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary under this Section 7, a Specified Employee will not receive any distribution under this Plan during the six-month period immediately following his or her Separation from Service.
The Account of a Specified Employee will be distributed in the form elected under subsection (A) above. This distribution will commence as of the later of:
 
 
 
If a Participant has elected installments under (A) above, subsequent installment payments will be made in January of each successive year until the Account is exhausted.
In the event of a Specified Employee's death during the six-month waiting period, the waiting period will cease to apply. The Specified Employee's benefits will be distributed in accordance with Section 8 (Death Benefits) below.
 
A Participant or Beneficiary may elect to receive a distribution of all or a portion of his or her Accounts immediately, regardless of whether benefit payments have commenced, to the extent that the Participant or Beneficiary incurs an Unforeseeable Emergency.
The amount of the distribution will be limited to the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need, including any taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution, as determined by the Committee.
 
If a Participant dies before his or her entire Account has been distributed, the remaining Account balance will be distributed to his or her Beneficiary in accordance with the Deferral Elections filed with the Committee. Distributions to the Beneficiary will be made at the same time and in the same form as the payment that otherwise would have been made to the Participant.
 
To the extent no distribution election has been filed, the remaining Account balance will be paid to the Beneficiary in a single sum in January of the calendar year following the Participant's death.
Prior to October 1, 2006, a Participant could elect one or more fixed payments be made from the Plan to the Participant's personal representative or designated beneficiary, following the Participant's death. Such payments, if approved by the Committee, shall be made within 15 months after the Participant's death. Any amounts thereafter remaining in the Participant's Account will be distributed in accordance with the Participants elections. Any such elections on file as of October 1, 2006 will continue in effect unless a subsequent Beneficiary designation has been filed.
 
 
 
This Section 11 addresses the form and timing of payment for a Participant who rehires to the Company following a Separation from Service. For purposes of this Section 11, a rehire includes a Participant who returns to the Company following a Separation from Service that is deemed to occur under Code section 409A due to an Authorized Period of Absence or a period of a reduced level services.
 
This subsection (A) applies to a rehired Participant who has received or begun receiving benefits under the Plan.
. Installment payments that commenced prior to the Participant's rehire with respect to Deferrals made before the Participant's Separation from Service ("Old Deferrals") will not be suspended by reason of the Participant's rehire. These Old Deferrals will continue to be paid until exhausted, without regard to the period of rehire.
Old Deferrals
 
. To the extent a Participant made additional Deferrals while on an Authorized Period of Absence or during a period of a reduced level of services that constituted a deemed Separation from Service under Code section 409A, such Deferrals will be distributed in January of the first Plan Year following the year in which they are made, in accordance with the Participant's earlier distribution election. This is because the Participant has already satisfied the conditions for payment under Section 7(a); namely, he or she has attained the specified age and has experienced a Separation from Service attributable to such Deferrals.
Interim Deferrals
. Deferrals attributable to periods after the date of rehire ("New Deferrals") will remain subject to the Participant's earlier distribution election as to the timing and form of payment under Section 7(A) (subject to the change rules in Section 7(B)), without regard to any Separation from Service that occurred prior to rehire. As a result, New Deferrals will be distributed in January following the Participant's Separation from Service , in the form selected under the original distribution election. This is because the Participant already has attained the specified age under Section 7(A) but has not yet experienced a Separation from Service attributable to the New Deferrals.
New Deferrals
after rehire
 
This subsection (B) applies to a rehired Participant who has not begun receiving benefits under the Plan because he or she has not attained the specified age under Section 7(A).
. The rehired Participant's Old Deferrals (and any Deferrals made during an Authorized Period of Absence or a period of a reduced level of services) will remain subject to the Participant's earlier distribution election as to the timing and form of payment under Section 7(A) (subject to the change rules in Section 7(B)). This means that if the Participant's original distribution election selected benefits in the form of a lump sum (or installments) payable in January following attainment of a specified age under Section 7(A), then the Participant's Old Deferrals (and any Deferrals made during an Authorized Period of Absence or period of a reduced level of services) will be payable as a lump sum (or installments, if elected) in January following the year in which he or she attains the specified age, even if the Participant has not had a subsequent Separation from Service after rehire. This result will not change in the event that the Participant attains the specified age after the initial Separation from Service (or while on Authorized Period of Absence or during a period of a reduced level of services), but is rehired before benefits actually began.
Old and Interim Deferrals
. The Participant's New Deferrals will remain subject to the Participant's earlier distribution election as to the timing and form of payment under Section 7(A) (subject to the change rules in Section 7(B)), without regard to any Separation from Service that occurred prior to rehire, as described in Section 11(A) above. As a result, New Deferrals will be distributed either (i) in January following the Participants Separation from Service , or (ii) in January
New Deferrals
after rehire
 
following both the Participant's Separation from Service and after attainment of the specified age, in accordance with the original distribution election. This is because the Participant has not yet experienced a Separation from Service attributable to the New Deferrals.
after rehire
 
 
Except to the extent provided in Section 10 of the Plan, the right of a Participant, legal representative or beneficiary to receive payments from the Plan shall not be subject to anticipation, sale, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge, nor shall such right be liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities or torts of the Participant or the Participant's legal representative or beneficiaries.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement between The Boeing Company, Hughes Electronics Corporation and Hughes Telecommunications and Space Company dated as of January 13, 2000 (the "Agreement") and effective as of the closing date under the Agreement ("Closing Date"), the Committee designated certain employees of Boeing Satellite Systems, Inc. ("BSS") as Executive Payroll employees eligible to participate in this Plan ("Satellite Executives").
The deferral elections of Satellite Executives in effect pursuant to the Hughes Electronic Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan ("Hughes Plan") as of the Closing Date were deemed to be irrevocable deferral elections in effect for purposes of this Plan for salary and cash payments related to the Hughes Annual Incentive Plan and Long-Term Achievement Plan paid by BSS in 2000 and 2001.
Satellite Executives eligible for Company performance shares and restricted stock units in lieu of payments under the Hughes Long-Term Achievement Plan were provided the opportunity to make a deferral election with respect to such awards.
Accounts under this Plan were established for Satellite Executives in an amount equal to their account balances as of the Closing Date under the Hughes Plan. Such accounts shall be paid in accordance with the distribution rules under Section 7. Except for such account balances, no Liability, as defined in the Agreement, shall accrue or be paid with respect to any Satellite Employee or Retired Satellite Employee, as defined in the Agreement, under the Hughes Plan on or after the Closing Date.
Satellite Executives with account balances established as of the Closing Date and/or who have irrevocable deferral elections in effect as of the Closing Date may elect earnings credits on deferred amounts in accordance with Section 5.

Any changes made under this paragraph will be invalid to the extent they affect distributions scheduled for the Plan Year in which the change is made.

will begin no later than the first January following the calendar year in which the Participant Separates from Service. In the event that no distribution option is elected under Section 6.1 above, the Participant will be deemed to have elected to receive a single lump sum distribution.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary under this Section 6, a Specified Employee will not receive any distribution under this Plan during the six-month period immediately following his or her Separation from Service.
The Account of a Specified Employee will be distributed in the form elected under Section 6.1 above. This distribution will commence as of the later of:
 
 
 
If a Participant has elected installments under Section 6.1 above, subsequent installment payments will be made in January of each successive year until the Account is exhausted.
In the event of a Specified Employee's death during the six-month waiting period, the waiting period will cease to apply. The Specified Employee's benefits will be distributed in accordance with Section 7 (Death Benefits) below.
 
A Participant or Beneficiary may elect to receive a distribution of all or a portion of his or her Accounts immediately, regardless of whether benefit payments have commenced, to the extent that the Participant or Beneficiary incurs an Unforeseeable Emergency.
 
PAGE 6
The amount of the distribution will be limited to the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need, including any taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution, as determined by the Committee.
 
If a Participant dies before his or her entire Account has been distributed, the remaining Account balance will be distributed to his or her Beneficiary in accordance with the Deferral Elections filed with the Committee. Distributions to the Beneficiary will be made at the same time and in the same form as the payment that otherwise would have been made to the Participant.
To the extent no distribution election has been filed, the remaining Account balance will be paid to the Beneficiary in a single sum in January of the calendar year following the Participant's death.
Prior to October 1, 2006, a Participant could elect one or more fixed payments be made from the Plan to the Participant's personal representative or designated beneficiary, following the Participant's death. Such payments, if approved by the Committee, shall be made within 15 months after the Participant's death. Any amounts thereafter remaining in the Participant's Account will be distributed in accordance with the Participants elections. Any such elections on file as of October 1, 2006 will continue in effect unless a subsequent Beneficiary designation has been filed.
 
 
The right of a Participant or the Participant's legal representative or beneficiary to receive payments from the Plan shall not be subject to anticipation, sale, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge, nor shall such right be liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities or torts of the Participant or the Participant's legal representative or beneficiaries.

Exhibit 10.3
 
 
 
The Supplemental Benefit Plan for Employees of The Boeing Company (Plan) was originally established effective January 1, 1978 by The Boeing Company. The Plan is hereby amended and restated effective January 1, 2008 to comply with section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code).
The purpose of the Plan is to supplement the benefits of certain employees under The Boeing Company Voluntary Investment Plan, to the extent that these qualified plan benefits are limited by sections 415 and 401(a)(17) of the Code.
For periods prior to January 1, 1999, the Plan also supplemented participants' benefits under The Boeing Company Employee Retirement Plan and The Boeing Company Employee Financial Security Plan, to the extent these benefits were limited by sections 415 and 401(a)(17) of the Code. For the period January 1, 1987 through May 31, 1987, the Plan also supplemented benefits reduced by the limitation on Elective Deferrals imposed by section 402(g)(1) of the Code.
It is intended that the Plan shall be an excess benefit plan as defined in section 3(36) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to the extent benefits are paid in excess of the limits imposed by section 415 of the Code. To the extent any part of the Plan is not an excess benefit plan, it is intended that the Plan is an unfunded plan maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation to a select group of management or highly compensated employees under sections 201(2), 301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1) of ERISA.
 
"Account" means the recordkeeping account established for each Participant in the Plan, for purposes of accounting for Deferrals, Matching Credits and Earnings Credits.
 
"Affiliate or Subsidiary" means a member of a controlled group of corporations (as defined in Code section 1563(a), determined without regard to Code sections 1563(a)(4) and (e)(3)(c)), a group of trades or businesses (whether incorporated or not) which are under common control within the meaning of Code section 414(c), or an affiliated service group (as defined in Code sections 414(m) or 414(o)) of which The Boeing Company is a part.
 
"Authorized Period of Absence" means a leave of absence approved by the Company.
 
"Base Salary" means an Employee's annual base rate of pay from the Company.
 
"Beneficiary" generally means the person or persons designated by a Participant under the VIP to receive any benefit payable from the VIP upon the death of the Participant.

In no event will Compensation include payments under any incentive compensation plan, without regard to whether it is included in compensation under the VIP.
 
"Deferrals" means the portion of a Participant's Compensation, if any, that he or she elects to defer on a pre-tax basis under this Plan in accordance with Section 4.1.
 
"Deferral Election" means the election made by an Eligible Employee to defer a portion of his or her Compensation in accordance with Section 4.1.

"Participant" means an Eligible Employee who has elected to defer Compensation under the Plan in accordance with Article IV, or an Employee or former Employee who has amounts credited to his or her Account.
 
"Plan" means this Supplemental Benefit Plan for Employees of The Boeing Company as herein set forth, together with any amendments that may be adopted.
 
"Plan Year" means the calendar year.
 
"SERP" means the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan for Employees of The Boeing Company.
 
"Separation from Service" or "Separates from Service" means an Employee's death, retirement or termination of employment from the Company within the meaning of Code section 409A. For purposes of determining whether a Separation from Service has occurred, Affiliates and Subsidiaries are defined by using the language "at least 80 percent" to define the controlled group under Code section 1563(a) in lieu of the 50 percent default rule stated in Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-1(h)(3).
 
A Separation from Service is deemed to include a reasonably anticipated permanent reduction in the level of services performed by an Employee, to less than 50 percent of the average level of services performed by the Employee during the immediately preceding 36-month period.
 
"Specified Employee" means an Employee who is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Code section 409A. Specified Employee status is determined on the last day of the prior Plan Year, to take effect as of April 1 of the Plan Year for a 12-month period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Specified Employees shall be determined by including the employees whom the Company reasonably determines to be the 75 top-paid officers of the Company rather than the 50 top-paid officers as provided under Code section 416(i)(1)(A), to the extent permitted under Code section 409A.
 
"Unforeseeable Emergency" means "unforeseeable emergency" within the meaning of Code section 409A, as determined by the Committee.
 
"VIP" means The Boeing Company Voluntary Investment Plan.
 
 
An Employee is eligible to participate in the Plan for a Plan Year if he or she satisfies each of the conditions described in (A)-(C) below:
 
 
 
The dollar limit imposed by section 415(c) of the Code for the prior Plan Year, divided by the percentage equal to the sum of (i), (ii) and (iii), as applicable.
 
 
 
Example: Assume that the Code section 415(c) limit is $45,000 for the current Plan Year, the maximum VIP employee contribution is 20% of compensation, and the maximum VIP employer matching contribution is 6% (75% of up to 8% of compensation), for the current Plan Year. To be eligible to participate in this Plan during the Plan Year, the Employee's Base Salary as of October 1
following
st
must be at least $173,000 ($45,000/(20% + 6%) = $45,000/.26). If the Employee actively participates in the BSS Plan, which requires a 3% employee contribution, his or her Base Salary as of October 1
st
must be at least $155,000 ($45,000/(20% + 6% + 3%) = $45,000/.29).
 
Effective March 22, 2003, participants in the Boeing Satellite Systems Voluntary Savings Plan (the "BSS Voluntary Savings Plan") became eligible to participate in the VIP. Consequently, a former participant in the BSS Voluntary Savings Plan who met the eligibility requirements of this Plan as of March 22, 2003 became eligible for benefits under this Plan based upon his or her participation in the VIP.
 
An Eligible Employee will become a Participant when he or she elects to defer Compensation by filing a timely Deferral Election in accordance with Article IV below.
 
Each Participant shall be entitled to benefits under this Plan as follows:
 
An Eligible Employee may elect to defer a percentage of his or her Compensation otherwise payable by the Company for a Plan Year by executing and delivering a Deferral Election, as described further below. This percentage is limited to the maximum percentage described in Section 3.1(C)(i), as applicable to the Eligible Employee. A new Deferral Election must be executed with respect to each Plan Year.
Deferrals will be made from the Participant's Compensation only to the extent that either: (i) Compensation for the applicable Plan Year exceeds the limitation under Code section 401(a)(17), as indexed, or (ii) the Participant's annual additions under the VIP for the applicable Plan Year reach the dollar limitation of Code section 415(c), as indexed.
Deferred Compensation will be credited to the Participant's Account on the date the Compensation would otherwise be payable, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible.
 
A Participant's Deferral Election must be executed and delivered to the Company in accordance with rules established by the Committee.
 
In general, the Deferral Election must be filed during the election period established by the Committee. This election will become irrevocable as of the end of the election period, but in no event later than December 31 of the Plan Year in which the election is made. Each election will apply solely to the Compensation payable in the succeeding Plan Year. Participants must execute a new Deferral Election to defer Compensation payable in each succeeding Plan Year.
Deferral Elections generally may not be modified during the Plan Year. Likewise, an Employee eligible for this Plan remains subject to restrictions on mid-year contribution election changes under the VIP, in accordance with the terms of the VIP.
 
See Section 4.4 for a limited exception to the general rule on the irrevocability of Deferral Elections, in the event of Unforeseeable Emergency.
 
An Employee who becomes an Eligible Employee during the Plan Year (as a new hire, rehire or due to raise or promotion) will not be eligible to participate during such Plan Year.
 
The Committee will establish and maintain an Account for each Participant. The Account will be credited with Deferrals, as well as Matching Credits and Earnings Credits as described below. The Account will be reduced as payments are made.
 
A Participant who defers Compensation for a Plan Year will be credited with a Matching Credit from the Company. This Matching Credit will equal a percentage of the Participant's Deferrals for the Plan Year, subject to a limit on the Participant's Compensation from which Deferrals are made under this Plan for the Plan Year. The relevant net percentage will be limited to the maximum rate described in Section 3.1(C)(ii), as applicable to each Participant.
Matching Credits will be credited to the Participant's Account on the date that the underlying Deferral is credited to the Participant's Account.
 
For periods prior to January 1, 2009, a Participant's Account will be credited with earnings under the Interest Fund Method described in (i) below.
For periods on or after January 1, 2009, a Participant's Account will be credited, at the Participant's election, with earnings under either: (i) the Interest Fund Method, or (ii) the Other Investment Funds method, each as described below. In the absence of an election the Interest Fund method will be used.
 
Under the Interest Fund Method for periods prior to January 1, 2009, a Participant's Account will be adjusted each month in accordance with changes in the unit value of the Account to reflect interest, as of the first business day of that month. Interest will be calculated based on the value of the Account as of the last day of the preceding month.
 
For periods on or after January 1, 2009, a Participant's Account will be adjusted daily in accordance with changes in the unit value of the Account to reflect interest, based on the Participant's Account balance.
Interest will be calculated for each Plan Year as the mean between the high and low (during the first eleven months of the preceding Plan Year) of yields on AA-rated industrial bonds as reported by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., rounded to the nearest
 1
/
4
th
of one percent. The Company will notify Participants annually of the established interest rate.
 
For periods on or after January 1, 2009, in addition to the Interest Fund method of allocating earnings on Deferrals and Matching Credits, a Participant may choose to diversify his or her Account by electing that it be credited (or charged) with the expenses, income, gains and losses on investment funds similar to those offered under The Boeing Company Voluntary Investment Plan (excluding the Boeing Stock Fund and Stable Value Fund offered thereunder) as designated by the Committee from time to time, pursuant to an election by the Participant to have the Participant's Account credited as though the Participant had elected to invest in such funds in such increments as the Participant will direct in accordance with rules to be established by the Committee or its delegates; provided that the Committee may disregard such elections in its discretion.
 
For periods on or after January 1, 2009, a Participant may change how future Deferrals and Matching Credits are invested anytime during the Plan Year. The Participant may also transfer any portion of his or her Account from one fund to another on a daily basis, provided that a Participant may not transfer funds from one investment fund to another and back on the same day.
 
For Heritage BSS Participants, the benefits under this Plan shall also include any account as of April 3, 2003 under the BSS Excess Plan, as adjusted after April 3, 2003 for earnings, losses and expenses. As of April 4, 2003, all accounts of Heritage BSS Participants under the BSS Excess Plan were transferred to this Plan.
 
For purposes of this subsection (D), "Heritage BSS Participant" means any Participant in this Plan having a prior benefit under the BSS Excess Plan based on his or her participation in the BSS Voluntary Savings Plan.
 
A Participant's interest in his or her Accounts generally will be 100% vested at all times.
A Participant's Account may be forfeited or reduced in the event of one of the following events:
 
 
See Section 8.3 regarding the unfunded nature of this Plan.
 
Notwithstanding the election procedures described in Section 4.1, a Participant will be permitted to cancel an existing Deferral Election with regard to a Plan Year during that Plan Year, where the Participant incurs an Unforeseeable Emergency, as determined by the Committee.
To the extent that a Participant has elected and received a distribution due to an Unforeseeable Emergency under Section 5.1(F), the Participant will be deemed to have elected to cancel his or her Deferral Election for the remainder of the applicable Plan Year.
 
 
 
A Participant may elect the form and timing of distribution with regard to his or her entire Account (including future Deferrals, Matching Credits and Earnings Credits) as described below, subject to the cashout rule in subsection (B) below. This distribution election must be made at the same time the Participant makes his or her Deferral Election.
Distribution elections made with regard to a Participant's entire Account may be changed solely to the extent permitted under subsection (C) below.
 
The lump sum distribution option is a single lump sum payable in January of any Plan Year following the Participant's Separation from Service. The amount of such distribution will be based on the value of the Participant's Account determined as of the date of payment.
Payment of the lump sum will be made the later of: (i) January of the first Plan Year following Separation from Service, or (ii) January of the first Plan Year following the Participant's attainment of a specified age (subject to (D) below), as elected by the Participant under this Section 5.1.
 
The installment payment option is a series of annual installment payments for a period between 2 and 15 years. The amount payable to the Participant each year generally shall be computed by multiplying the balance in the Account (or the applicable portion of the Account) by a fraction, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the number of years remaining in the distribution period on the first day of January of such year. See Section 5.1(B) below for application of the cashout rule to installment payments.
Annual installment payments will begin the later of: (i) January of the first Plan Year following Separation from Service, or (ii) January of the first Plan Year following the Participant's attainment of a specified age (subject to (D) below), as elected by the Participant under this Section 5.1. Payments will continue until the full balance in the Participant's Account has been paid.
 
The Plan will respect previous distribution elections made by certain Participants who are former participants in the Boeing Satellite Systems Salaried Employees' Excess Benefit Plan ("BSS Excess Plan"). For these Participants, any distribution election made prior to April 4, 2003 under section 3(b)(5) of the BSS Excess Plan will apply, unless the Participant elects otherwise under this Article V.
In the event that no distribution option is elected, the Participant will be deemed to have elected to receive a single lump sum payable in January of the first Plan Year following the Participant's Separation from Service.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following rules shall apply, subject to the six-month delay in payment for Specified Employees under (E):
 
 
 
Effective January 1, 2008, a Participant may change a distribution election with regard to his or her entire Account only once after the initial distribution election is made, in accordance with the conditions stated below. To the extent such change would defer commencement of any portion of the Participant's Account beyond both age 70
 1
/
2
and Separation from Service, the change will not be effective with respect to such portion.
 
 
 
In no event can installment payments be revoked once they have begun.
Prior to January 1, 2008, a Participant may change a distribution election with regard to his or her entire Account, in accordance with procedures established by the Committee, without the restrictions stated above. Any changes made under this paragraph will be invalid to the extent they affect distributions scheduled for the Plan Year in which the change is made.
 
Payment of benefits under this Plan will begin not later than the first January following the calendar year in which the Participant both attains (or would have attained) age 70
 1
/
2
and is Separated from Service. Payment of benefits for Participants actively employed beyond age 70
 1
/
2
will begin no later than the first January following the calendar year in which the Participant Separates from Service. In the event that no distribution option is elected under (A) above, the Participant will be deemed to have elected to receive a single lump sum distribution.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary under this Article V, a Specified Employee will not receive any distribution under this Plan during the six-month period immediately following his or her Separation from Service.
The Account of a Specified Employee will be distributed in the form elected under subsection (A) above. This distribution will commence as of the later of:
 
 
 
If a Participant has elected installments under (A) above, subsequent installment payments will be made in January of each successive year until the Account is exhausted.
 
In the event of a Specified Employee's death during the six-month waiting period, the waiting period will cease to apply. The Specified Employee's benefits will be distributed in accordance with Section 5.2 (Death Benefits) below.
 
A Participant or Beneficiary may elect to receive a distribution of all or a portion of his or her Accounts immediately, regardless of whether benefit payments have commenced, to the extent that the Participant or Beneficiary incurs an Unforeseeable Emergency.
The amount of the distribution will be limited to the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need, including any taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution, as determined by the Committee.
 
If a Participant dies before his or her entire Account has been distributed, the remaining Account balance will be distributed to his or her Beneficiary in accordance with the Deferral Elections filed with the Committee. Distributions to the Beneficiary will be made at the same time and in the same form as the payment that otherwise would have been made to the Participant.
To the extent no distribution election has been filed, the remaining Account balance will be paid to the Beneficiary in a single sum in January of the calendar year following the Participant's death.
 
This Section 5.3 addresses the form and timing of payment for a Participant who rehires to the Company following a Separation from Service. For purposes of this Section 5.3, a rehire includes a Participant who returns to the Company following a Separation from Service that is deemed to occur under Code section 409A due to an Authorized Period of Absence or a period of a reduced level of services.
 
This subsection (A) applies to a rehired Participant who has received or begun receiving benefits under the Plan because he or she has experienced a Separation from Service and has attained the specified age (if applicable).
 
Installment payments that commenced prior to the Participant's rehire with respect to Deferrals made before the Participant's Separation from Service ("Old Deferrals") will not be suspended by reason of the Participant's rehire. These Old Deferrals will continue to be paid until exhausted, without regard to the period of rehire.
Old Deferrals.
To the extent a Participant made additional Deferrals while on an Authorized Period of Absence or during a period of a reduced level of services that constituted a deemed Separation from Service under Code section 409A, such Deferrals will be distributed in January of the first Plan Year following the year in which they are made, in accordance with the Participant's earlier distribution election. This is because the Participant has already satisfied the conditions for payment under Section 5.1(A); namely, he or she has attained the specified age and has experienced a Separation from Service attributable to such Deferrals.
Interim Deferrals.
Deferrals attributable to periods after the date of rehire ("New Deferrals") will remain subject to the Participant's earlier distribution election as to the timing and form of payment under Section 5.1(A) (subject to the change rules in Section 5.1(C)), without regard to any Separation from Service that occurred prior to rehire. As a result, New Deferrals will be distributed in January following the Participant's Separation from Service , in the form selected under the original distribution election. This is because the Participant already has attained the specified age under Section 5.1(A) but has not yet experienced a Separation from Service attributable to the New Deferrals.
New Deferrals.
after rehire
 
This subsection (B) applies to a rehired Participant who has not begun receiving benefits under the Plan because he or she has not attained the specified age under Section 5.1(A).
. The rehired Participant's Old Deferrals (and any Deferrals made during an Authorized Period of Absence or a period of a reduced level of services) will remain subject to the Participant's earlier distribution election as to the timing and form of payment under Section 5.1(A) (subject to the change rules in Section 5.1(C)). This means that if the Participant's original distribution election selected benefits in the form of a lump sum (or installments) payable in January following attainment of a specified age under Section 5.1(A), then the Participant's Old Deferrals (and any Deferrals made during an Authorized Period of Absence or a period of a reduced level of services) will be payable as a lump sum (or installments, if so elected) in January following the year in which he or she attains the specified age, even if the Participant has not had a subsequent Separation from Service after rehire. This result will not change in the event that the Participant attains the specified age after the initial Separation from Service (or while on Authorized Period of Absence or during a period of a reduced level of services), but is rehired before benefits actually begin.
Old and Interim Deferrals
 
. The Participant's New Deferrals will remain subject to the Participant's earlier distribution election as to the timing and form of payment under Section 5.1(A) (subject to the change rules in Section 5.1(C)), without regard to any Separation from Service that occurred prior to rehire, as described in Section 5.3(A) above. As a result, New Deferrals will be distributed either (i) in January following the Participant's Separation from Service , or (ii) in January following both the Participant's Separation from Service and after attainment of the specified age, in accordance with the original distribution election. This is because the Participant has not yet experienced a Separation from Service attributable to the New Deferrals.

The Plan shall be administered by the Committee. The Committee shall make such rules, interpretations, determinations of fact and computations as it may deem appropriate. Any decision of the Committee with respect to the Plan, including (without limitation) any determination of eligibility to participate in the Plan and any calculation of plan benefits, shall be conclusive and binding on all persons. The Committee shall submit to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors periodic reports covering the operation of the Plan.
 
The procedures for making claims for benefits under the Plan and for having the denial of a benefits claim reviewed shall be the same as those procedures set forth in the VIP.
 
The Board of Directors of The Boeing Company shall have the authority to amend or terminate the Plan at any time. The Board of Directors may delegate its authority to amend the Plan at any time, in its sole discretion. In the event of Plan amendment or termination, a Participant's benefits under the Plan shall not be less than the Plan benefits to which the Participant would be entitled if the Participant had terminated employment immediately prior to such amendment or termination of the Plan.
In general, upon the termination of the Plan with respect to any Participant, the affected Participants will not be entitled to receive a distribution until the time specified in Article V. Notwithstanding the foregoing, The Boeing Company may, in its discretion, terminate the entire Plan and pay each Participant a single lump-sum distribution of his or her entire accrued benefit to the extent permitted under conditions set forth in Code section 409A and any IRS or Treasury guidance thereunder.
 
 
Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to give any person any right to remain in the employ of the Company or affect any right of the Company to terminate a person's employment with or without cause.
 
No benefit under the Plan shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, execution, attachment, garnishment, or any other legal process. Any attempt to take such action shall be void and shall authorize the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, to forfeit all further right and interest in any benefit under this Plan. In addition, a Participant's Account may be reduced by the amount of any tax obligation paid by the Company on behalf of a Participant or surviving spouse, if the Participant or surviving spouse fails to reimburse the Company for such obligation.
 
No funds shall be segregated or earmarked for any current or former participant, Beneficiary or other person under the Plan. However, the Company may establish one or more trusts to assist in meeting its obligations under the Plan, the assets of which shall be subject to the claims of the Company's general creditors. No current or former Participant, Beneficiary or other person, individually or as a member of a group, shall have any right, title or interest in any account, fund, grantor trust, or any asset that may be acquired by the Company in respect of its obligations under the Plan (other than as a general creditor of the Company with an unsecured claim against its general assets).
 
Payment of benefits under this Plan may be delayed to the extent permitted by Code section 409A, as determined by the Committee.
 
If a determination is made that the Account of any Participant (or his or her Beneficiary) is subject to current income taxation under Code section 409A, then the taxable portion of such Account will be immediately distributed to the Participant (or his or her Beneficiary), notwithstanding the general timing rules described in Article V above.
 
It is intended that amounts deferred under this Plan will not be taxable under section 409A of the Code with respect to any individual. All provisions of this Plan shall be construed in a manner consistent with this intent.
 
The validity of the Plan or any of its provisions will be determined under and will be construed according to federal law and, to the extent permissible, according to the internal laws of the state of Illinois. If any provision of the Plan is held illegal or invalid for any reason, such determination will not affect the remaining provisions of the Plan and the Plan will be construed and enforced as if said illegal or invalid provision had never been included.
 
No legal action may be brought in court on a claim for benefits under the Plan after 180 days following the decision on appeal (or 180 days following the expiration of the time to make an appeal if no appeal is made).
 
 
In July 1998, Hughes Space and Communications Company, Hughes Electron Dynamics, Inc. and Spectrolab, Inc. ("Hughes") adopted a special appendix (the "Hughes Appendix") to the Hughes Excess Plan. Individuals affected by the Hughes Appendix are referred to in this Special Appendix as "Hughes Participants".
That Hughes Appendix was adopted to provide certain Hughes Participants whose benefits from the Hughes Retirement Plan were initially miscalculated an election to receive alternative benefits. These benefits are referred to as the "Substitute Benefit".
The initial miscalculation for these Hughes Participants was the subject of a filing with the Internal Revenue Service under the Voluntary Compliance Resolution ("VCR") program on August 22, 1997. On January 28, 1998, the Internal Revenue Service issued a compliance statement concerning the VCR application. Under the compliance statement, Hughes corrected the miscalculation by reducing the benefits payable to the affected Hughes Participants under the Hughes Retirement Plan from the initially calculated amount. Under the correction approved by the IRS in the VCR application, payments under the Hughes Retirement Plan would continue at the monthly amount originally scheduled under the initial calculation. When the actuarial equivalent value of a Hughes Participant's benefits paid under the Hughes Retirement Plan reaches the maximum limit imposed by section 415 of the Code, then the remaining payments to the Hughes Participant will be made under the Hughes Excess Plan. The benefits which were originally scheduled for payment under the Hughes Retirement Plan under the initial calculation, but which will instead be paid pursuant to the Hughes Excess Plan after the maximum limit of section 415 has been reached, are referred to in this Appendix as the "Reclassified Payments." Benefits paid under the Hughes Retirement Plan are not considered Reclassified Payments, even if the payments exceeded the limits of section 415 of the Code and therefore are not afforded the tax treatment (including the ability to elect a rollover) afforded to qualified plan payments.
As a result of the initial miscalculation, some benefit payments from the Hughes Retirement Plan which Hughes Participants rolled over into their individual retirement accounts were withdrawn to avoid or minimize excise taxes ("Required IRA Withdrawals"). Hughes Participants who made Required IRA Withdrawals were entitled to elect the Substitute Benefit.
 
Furthermore, certain Hughes Participants received payments from the Hughes Retirement Plan in 1998 which were in excess of the maximum benefit allowed by Code section 415 under the method of calculating the maximum benefit as described in the VCR application ("1998 Excess Payments"). Such Hughes Participants were entitled to elect the Substitute Benefit.
In addition, under their original benefit elections, certain Hughes Participants were scheduled to have received Reclassified Payments which were not yet paid as of July 31, 1999. Such Hughes Participants were entitled to elect the Substitute Benefit.
Under the Hughes Appendix, each affected Hughes Participant was given an election to be paid the Substitute Benefit. In order to elect the Substitute Benefit, a Hughes Participant must have signed and delivered to Hughes a written release in the form and manner acceptable to Hughes. The Substitute Benefit was provided in consideration for the Hughes Participant's agreement, made pursuant to the release, to forego legal action against Hughes and the other persons specified in the release.
This Special Appendix is intended to provide the unpaid balance of the Substitute Benefit to Hughes Participants who are Acquired Hughes Participants. Only Acquired Hughes Participants are affected by this Special Appendix to the Plan.
Effective as of April 4, 2003, this Appendix A was transferred in its entirety from the Boeing Satellite Systems Salaried Employees' Excess Benefit Plan to the Plan.
 
 
The following Hughes Participants were provided an opportunity to elect the Substitute Benefit: (1) Hughes Participants for whom Reclassified Payments were to be made on or after August 1, 1998, (2) Hughes Participants who received 1998 Excess Payments, and (3) Hughes Participants who made Required IRA Withdrawals. The election of the Substitute Benefit was made in the time and manner prescribed by Hughes. The election must have specified the date on which the Hughes Participant elected to commence payment of the Substitute Benefit, which must have been a date which was the first through fifteenth anniversary of the Hughes Participant's "Deferral Start Date." The Deferral Start Date for a Hughes Participant is the later of (x) August 1, 1998, or (y) the day as of which the initial Reclassified Payment would have been scheduled for payment to the Hughes Participant, but for the election to receive the Substitute Benefit. The election must have specified whether the Hughes
 
Participant elected payment in a single installment, two substantially equal annual installments, or five substantially equal annual installments. The election must have been accompanied by a properly executed release acceptable to Hughes. If a Hughes Participant did not effectively elect the Substitute Benefit, then the Hughes Participant's remaining Reclassified Payments (if any) would be made to the Hughes Participant pursuant to the general provisions in the Hughes Excess Plan applicable to payments attributable to the Hughes Retirement Plan, as contemplated in the VCR application.
Any election described above by an Acquired Hughes Participant will continue to apply under this Special Appendix. Any Acquired Hughes Participant who did not make an effective election will continue to have his or her remaining Reclassified Payments (if any) made pursuant to the general provisions in the Plan (as successor to the Hughes Excess Plan) applicable to payments attributable to the Retirement Plan (as successor to the Hughes Retirement Plan), as contemplated in the VCR application.
 
If a Hughes Participant elected the Substitute Benefit, then in lieu of payment from the generally applicable provisions of the Hughes Excess Plan of the Hughes Participant's remaining Reclassified Payments (if any), the Substitute Benefit became payable. The Substitute Benefit was the amount credited to the Hughes Participant's Hughes Account, calculated as described in Section A.2.4(a) of this Appendix.
 
 
Certain Hughes Participants elected a short-term deferral of Reclassified Payments which, but for such election, would have been paid between January 1, 1998 and July 1, 1998. Under this Appendix, the term "Suspended Payments" refers to the Reclassified Payments which were subject to the short-term deferral described in the preceding sentence.
 
The term "Proximate Reclassified Payments" refers to those Reclassified Payments (other than Suspended Payments) which, in the absence of an election of the Substitute Benefit, would have been scheduled for payment under the Hughes Excess Plan on or prior to July 1, 1999.
 
The term "Distant Reclassified Payments" refers to Reclassified Payments which, in the absence of an election of the Substitute Benefit, would have been scheduled for payment under the Hughes Excess Plan after July 1, 1999. Distant Reclassified Payments may be recalculated to reflect how the Retirement Plan implemented the repeal of section 415(e) of the Code.
 
The term "Settlement Credit" refers to an amount calculated for each Hughes Participant which is the greater of (i) or (ii) below:
 
 
 
The term "Acquired Hughes Participant" means any person who became a Participant or a Former Participant under the terms of the Employee Matters Agreement between The Boeing Company and Hughes Electronics Corporation.
 
The term "Hughes Retirement Plan" means the Hughes Non-Bargaining Retirement Plan.
 
 
Hughes established an account, for bookkeeping purposes only, for each Hughes Participant who elected the Substitute Benefit (the "Hughes Account"). The Hughes Account was to be credited as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
On the Closing Date, the Company shall establish an account, for bookkeeping purposes only, for each Acquired Hughes Participant who elected the Substitute Benefit (the "BSS Account"). The BSS Account shall be credited as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
The BSS Account will be paid to the Acquired Hughes Participant as specified in the election described in Section A.2.1 of this Appendix.
 
The unpaid balance of the BSS Account will be paid to the Acquired Hughes Participant's Beneficiary as follows.
Unless the Hughes Participant elected otherwise, one-half of the unpaid balance of the BSS Account shall be paid as soon as feasible following the Acquired Hughes Participant's death and the remaining one-half shall be paid in January of the following year.
Each Hughes Participant was entitled to elect, at the time of the Hughes Participant's election under Section A.2.1 of this Appendix, that the benefit payable to the Beneficiary following the death of the Hughes Participant shall be made at the time and in the manner payment would have been made to the Hughes Participant during the Hughes Participant's life. This election will continue to apply to Acquired Hughes Participants.
If Reclassified Payments remain unpaid following payment of the BSS Account to the Beneficiary, then the Reclassified Payments shall be paid to the Beneficiary at the time the Reclassified Payments would have been paid but for the election of the Substitute Benefit. Unless an Acquired Hughes Participant elects otherwise, the Beneficiary for purposes of this Appendix shall be the Beneficiary otherwise designated under the Retirement Plan. The Acquired Hughes Participant shall be entitled to name a different Beneficiary for purposes of this Appendix.
 
 
This Appendix is incorporated by reference into the Plan as if set forth fully therein. Any capitalized terms used in this Appendix which are not defined in this Appendix shall have the meanings specified in the Plan.
 
Elections by a Hughes Participant under this Appendix are irrevocable.
 
In 1997, the Hughes' defense businesses were acquired by Raytheon Company. As part of that transaction, the Hughes and Raytheon Company agreed that the liabilities of the Plan and the assets and liabilities of the Retirement Plan attributable to defense employees and retirees will be transferred to plans sponsored by Raytheon Company. Accordingly, the provisions of this Appendix apply only to non-defense retirees, and no benefit is created under this Appendix for defense retirees.
 
Code section 415(e) was repealed effective for limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2000. The repeal may increase the limitation on benefits payable from the Retirement Plan to some or all Acquired Hughes Participants who elected the Substitute Benefit. The Company reserves the right to pay the Substitute Benefit from the Retirement Plan in lieu of the benefits payable hereunder to the extent permitted by law.
 
 
Prior to January 1, 1999, this Plan offered certain benefits to participants in the BCERP whose benefits were affected by the limitations on benefits or contributions imposed by section 415 and 401(a)(17) of the Code. Effective January 1, 1999, certain of those participants were transferred to the SERP and ceased to be eligible for benefits under this Plan based upon their participation in the BCERP. To the extent any participant eligible for benefits under this Plan based upon his or her participation in the BCERP was not transferred to the SERP, such participant shall remain eligible to participate in this Plan and to receive such benefits. Effective January 1, 2008, all such benefits remaining under this Plan have commenced and are not subject to the deferral and distribution rules under Articles IV & V of the 2008 restatement.
With respect to the BCERP, the benefits under this Plan represent the difference between the actual benefits of a Participant under the BCERP and the benefits that would have been payable under that plan except for the limitations on benefits imposed by sections 415 and 401(a)(17) of the Code. The benefits payable under this Plan with respect to the BCERP were payable to the Participant or to any other person who is receiving or entitled to receive benefits with respect to the Participant under the BCERP, and were paid in the same form, at the same times and for the same period as benefits were paid with respect to the Participant under the BCERP.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Actuarial Equivalent of the benefit payable under this Plan with respect to the BCERP was $10,000 or less, the Actuarial Equivalent value of the benefit was paid in the form of an automatic lump sum at the same time as benefits began or were paid under the BCERP. Actuarial Equivalent is defined in the BCERP. This paragraph applies to Participants who retire or begin receiving termination benefits under the BCERP on or after February 1, 1997, and for this purpose the Actuarial Equivalent shall be determined as of the Participant's Retirement Date under the Employee Retirement Plan. This paragraph shall also apply to Participants who are receiving benefits under this Plan as of February 1, 1997, and for this purpose the Actuarial Equivalent shall be determined with respect to each participant's remaining benefits payable under this Plan determined as of February 1, 1997.
Effective January 1, 1999, any Employee who is eligible to participate in the SERP shall no longer be entitled to any benefit under this Appendix B1.1. To the extent any such Employee is determined to be entitled to a benefit under this Appendix B1.1 of the Plan, such benefit shall be offset by any benefits received under the SERP. Any Employee who was a Participant in this Plan as of December 31, 1998 and eligible for a benefit under this Appendix B1.1 shall remain eligible for such benefit unless and until such Employee becomes eligible to participate in the SERP. The Plan will respect beneficiary designations made by a Participant at the time of commencement of the benefit under this Section B.1.1, notwithstanding any contrary definition of Beneficiary under the Plan.
 
Prior to January 1, 1999, salaried employees who were not represented by a collective bargaining agent were eligible to participate in the FSP. Accordingly, participants in the FSP were eligible to participate in this Plan prior to that date, to the extent that their FSP benefits were limited by Code sections 415 and 401(a)(17).
The benefits under this Plan with respect to a particular year were the additional benefits that would have been payable under the FSP if the reduction on contributions and other additions had not been made. All amounts deferred under this Plan were credited to the Accounts of Participants at the time such amounts would otherwise have been credited to their accounts under the FSP.
For periods before January 1, 2009, a Participant's Account is credited with interest in accordance with the Interest Fund method under Section 4.2(B)(i).
For periods on or after January 1, 2009, a Participant's Account is credited with earnings in accordance with the method elected by the Participant under Section 4.2(B) (Earnings Credit Methods).
The benefits payable under this Plan with respect to the FSP will be payable to the Participant in accordance with the distribution rules under Article V.

Subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in Section 15, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan shall be 60 million.
4.2 Share Usage
(a) Shares of Common Stock covered by an Award shall not be counted as used unless and until they are actually issued and delivered to a Participant. If any Award lapses, expires, terminates or is canceled prior to the issuance of shares thereunder or if shares of Common Stock are issued under the Plan to a Participant and thereafter are reacquired by the Company, the shares subject to such Awards and the reacquired shares shall again be available for issuance under the Plan. In addition, the following shares of Common Stock shall not be treated as having been issued under the Plan: (i) shares tendered by a Participant or retained by the Company as full or partial payment to the Company for the purchase price of an Award or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with an Award, (ii) shares covered by an Award that is settled in cash, (iii) the number of shares subject to a SAR in excess of the number of shares that are delivered to the Participant upon exercise of the SAR, or (iv) shares issued pursuant to Substitute Awards. The number of shares available for issuance under the Plan shall not be reduced to reflect any dividends or dividend equivalents that are reinvested into additional shares or credited as additional Restricted Stock, Stock Units or Performance Shares. All shares issued under the Plan may be either authorized and unissued shares or issued shares reacquired by the Company.
(b) The Committee shall have the authority to grant Awards as an alternative to or as the form of payment for grants or rights earned or due under other compensation plans or arrangements of the Company.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum number of shares that may be issued upon the exercise of Incentive Stock Options shall equal the aggregate share number stated in Section 4.1, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 15.
4.3 Limitations
(a) Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 15, the aggregate number of shares that may be issued pursuant to Awards granted under the Plan (other than Awards of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights) that are not (i) subject to restrictions based on the satisfaction of specified performance goals or (ii) granted in lieu of the payment of performance-based cash incentive awards shall not exceed 12 million.
(b) Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 15, the aggregate number of shares that may be issued pursuant to Awards granted under the Plan (other than Awards of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights) that contain no restrictions or restrictions based solely on continuous employment or services for less than three years (except where Termination of Service occurs by reason of death, Retirement, Disability or Layoff) shall not exceed 3 million.
An Award may be granted to any employee, officer or director of the Company or a Related Company whom the Committee from time to time selects. An Award may also be granted to any consultant, agent, advisor or independent contractor for bona fide services rendered to the Company or any Related Company that (a) are not in connection with the offer and sale of the Company's securities in a capital-raising transaction and (b) do not directly or indirectly promote or maintain a market for the Company's securities. The above are "eligible persons."
 
Page 4
6.1 Form and Grant of Awards
The Committee shall have the authority, in its sole discretion, to determine the type or types of Awards to be granted under the Plan. Such Awards may be granted either alone, in addition to or in tandem with any other type of Award.
6.2 Evidence of Awards
Awards granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by a written instrument that shall contain such terms, conditions, limitations and restrictions as the Committee shall deem advisable and that are not inconsistent with the Plan.
6.3 Deferrals
The Committee may permit a Participant to defer receipt of the payment of any Award. If any such deferral election is permitted, the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall establish rules and procedures for such payment deferrals, which may include the grant of additional Awards or provisions for the payment or crediting of interest or dividend equivalents, including converting such credits to deferred stock unit equivalents. The value of the payment so deferred may be allocated to a deferred account established for a Participant under any deferred compensation plan of the Company designated by the Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any deferral made under this Section 6.3 will be made under a deferred compensation plan of the Company or pursuant to the terms of an employment agreement, either of which satisfies the requirements for exemption from or complies with Section 409A.
6.4 Dividends and Distributions
Participants holding Awards may, if the Committee so determines, be credited with dividends paid with respect to the underlying shares or dividend equivalents while the Awards are so held in a manner determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. The Committee may apply any restrictions to the dividends or dividend equivalents that the Committee deems appropriate. The Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine the form of payment of dividends or dividend equivalents, including cash, shares of Common Stock, Restricted Stock or Stock Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the right to any dividends or dividend equivalents declared and paid on the number of shares underlying an Option or a Stock Appreciation Right may not be contingent, directly or indirectly on the exercise of the Option or a Stock Appreciation Right, and an Award providing a right to dividends or dividend equivalents declared and paid on the number of shares underlying an Option or a Stock Appreciation Right, the payment of which is not contingent upon, or otherwise payable on, the exercise of the Option or a Stock Appreciation Right, must comply with or qualify for an exemption under Section 409A.
7.1 Grant of Options
The Committee may grant Options designated as Incentive Stock Options or Nonqualified Stock Options.
7.2 Option Exercise Price
The exercise price for shares purchased under an Option shall be as determined by the Committee, but shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock for the Grant Date, except in the case of Substitute Awards. In no event shall the Committee, without the prior approval of the Company's shareholders, cancel any outstanding Option for the purpose of reissuing the Option to the Participant at a lower exercise price or reduce the exercise price of an outstanding Option.
7.3 Term of Options
Subject to earlier termination in accordance with the terms of the Plan and the instrument evidencing the Option, the maximum term of an Option shall be a term not to exceed ten years from the Grant Date as established for that Option by the Committee or, if not so established, shall be ten years from the Grant Date.
 
Page 5
7.4 Exercise of Options
The Committee shall establish and set forth in each instrument that evidences an Option the time at which, or the installments in which, the Option shall vest and become exercisable, any of which provisions may be waived or modified by the Committee at any time.
To the extent an Option has vested and become exercisable, the Option may be exercised in whole or from time to time in part by delivery as directed by the Company to the Company or a brokerage firm designated or approved by the Company of a written stock option exercise agreement or notice, in a form and in accordance with procedures established by the Committee, setting forth the number of shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised, the restrictions imposed on the shares purchased under such exercise agreement, if any, and such representations and agreements as may be required by the Committee, accompanied by payment in full as described in Section 7.5. An Option may be exercised only for whole shares and may not be exercised for less than a reasonable number of shares at any one time, as determined by the Committee.
7.5 Payment of Exercise Price
The exercise price for shares purchased under an Option shall be paid in full as directed by the Company to the Company or a brokerage firm designated or approved by the Company by delivery of consideration equal to the product of the Option exercise price and the number of shares purchased. Such consideration must be paid before the Company will issue the shares being purchased and must be in a form or a combination of forms acceptable to the Committee for that purchase, which forms may include: (a) check; (b) wire transfer; (c) tendering by attestation shares of Common Stock already owned by the Participant that on the day prior to the exercise date have a Fair Market Value equal to the aggregate exercise price of the shares being purchased under the Option, provided that the Participant must have held for at least six months any such tendered shares that were acquired by the Participant under a Company-sponsored stock compensation program; (d) to the extent permitted by applicable law, delivery of a properly executed exercise notice, together with irrevocable instructions to a brokerage firm designated or approved by the Company to deliver promptly to the Company the aggregate amount of sale or loan proceeds to pay the Option exercise price and any tax withholding obligations that may arise in connection with the exercise, all in accordance with the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board; or (e) such other consideration as the Committee may permit in its sole discretion.
7.6 Post-Termination Exercise
The Committee shall establish and set forth in each instrument that evidences an Option whether the Option shall continue to be exercisable, and the terms and conditions of such exercise, after a Termination of Service, any of which provisions may be waived or modified by the Committee at any time, provided that any such waiver or modification shall satisfy the requirements for exemption under Section 409A.
7.7 Incentive Stock Options
The terms of any Incentive Stock Options shall comply in all respects with the provisions of Section 422 of the Code, or any successor provision, and any regulations promulgated thereunder. Individuals who are not employees of the Company or one of its parent or subsidiary corporations (as such terms are defined for purposes of Section 422 of the Code) may not be granted Incentive Stock Options. To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of Common Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year exceeds $100,000 or, if different, the maximum limitation in effect at the time of grant under the Code (the Fair Market Value being determined as of the Grant Date for the Option), such portion in excess of $100,000 shall be treated as Nonqualified Stock Options.
8.1 Grant of Stock Appreciation Rights
The Committee may grant stock appreciation rights ("Stock Appreciation Rights" or "SARs") to Participants at any time. An SAR may be granted in tandem with an Option or alone ("freestanding"). The grant price of a tandem SAR shall be equal to the exercise price of the related Option, and the grant price of a freestanding SAR shall be equal to the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock for the Grant Date, except for Substitute Awards. An SAR may be exercised upon such terms and conditions and for the term as the
 
Page 6
Committee determines in its sole discretion; provided, however, that, subject to earlier termination in accordance with the terms of the Plan and the instrument evidencing the SAR, the term of a freestanding SAR shall be a term not to exceed ten years from the Grant Date as established for that SAR by the Committee or, if not so established, shall be ten years, and in the case of a tandem SAR, (a) the term shall not exceed the term of the related Option and (b) the tandem SAR may be exercised for all or part of the shares subject to the related Option upon the surrender of the right to exercise the equivalent portion of the related Option, except that the tandem SAR may be exercised only with respect to the shares for which its related Option is then exercisable.
8.2 Payment of SAR Amount
Upon the exercise of an SAR, a Participant shall be entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount determined by multiplying (a) the difference between the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock for the date of exercise over the grant price by (b) the number of shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised. At the discretion of the Committee, the payment upon exercise of an SAR may be in cash, in shares of equivalent value, in some combination thereof or in any other manner approved by the Committee in its sole discretion.
8.3 Post-Termination Exercise
The Committee shall establish and set forth in each instrument that evidences a freestanding SAR whether the SAR shall continue to be exercisable, and the terms and conditions of such exercise, after a Termination of Service, any of which provisions may be waived or modified by the Committee at any time, provided that any such waiver or modification shall satisfy the requirements for exemption under Section 409A.
9.1 Grant of Restricted Stock and Stock Units
The Committee may grant Restricted Stock and Stock Units on such terms and conditions and subject to such forfeiture restrictions, if any (which may be based on continuous service with the Company or a Related Company or the achievement of any of the Performance Criteria set forth in Section 11.2), as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion, which terms, conditions and restrictions shall be set forth in the instrument evidencing the Award.
9.2 Issuance of Shares
Upon the satisfaction of any terms, conditions and restrictions prescribed with respect to Restricted Stock or Stock Units, or upon a Participant's release from any terms, conditions and restrictions of Restricted Stock or Stock Units, as determined by the Committee, and subject to the provisions of Section 13, (a) the shares of Restricted Stock covered by each Award of Restricted Stock shall become freely transferable by the Participant, and (b) Stock Units shall be paid in cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion. Any fractional shares subject to such Awards shall be paid to the Participant in cash.
9.3 Waiver of Restrictions
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may waive the repurchase or forfeiture period and any other terms, conditions or restrictions on any Restricted Stock or Stock Unit under such circumstances and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee shall deem appropriate; provided, however, that the Committee may not adjust performance goals for any Restricted Stock or Stock Unit intended to be exempt under Section 162(m) for the year in which the Restricted Stock or Stock Unit is settled in such a manner as would increase the amount of compensation otherwise payable to a Participant.
10.1 Grant of Performance Shares
The Committee may grant Awards of performance shares ("Performance Shares") and designate the Participants to whom Performance Shares are to be awarded and determine the number of Performance Shares, the length of the Performance Period and the other terms and conditions of each such Award. Each Award of Performance Shares shall entitle the Participant to a payment in
 
Page 7
the form of shares of Common Stock upon the attainment of performance goals and other terms and conditions specified by the Committee. Notwithstanding satisfaction of any performance goals, the number of shares issued under an Award of Performance Shares may be adjusted on the basis of such further consideration as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion. The Committee, in its sole discretion, may make a cash payment equal to the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock otherwise required to be issued to a Participant pursuant to an Award of Performance Shares. It is generally expected that the Committee will exercise its discretion to make cash settlements of Awards of Performance Shares only with respect to Awards granted to Participants in countries other than the United States.
10.2 Grant of Performance Units
The Committee may grant Awards of performance units ("Performance Units") and designate the Participants to whom Performance Units are to be awarded and determine the number of Performance Units and the terms and conditions of each such Award. Performance Units shall entitle the Participant to a payment in cash upon the attainment of performance goals and other terms and conditions specified by the Committee, provided that the performance period for any Performance Unit Award shall be at least one year. Notwithstanding the satisfaction of any performance goals, the amount to be paid under an Award of Performance Units may be adjusted on the basis of such further consideration as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion. The Committee, in its sole discretion, may substitute actual shares of Common Stock for the cash payment otherwise required to be made to a Participant pursuant to a Performance Unit.
11.1 Terms of Section 162(m) Awards Generally
In addition to any other Awards under the Plan, the Committee may, at the time of grant of an Award (other than an Option or a Stock Appreciation Right) to a Participant who is then a Covered Employee or is likely to be a Covered Employee as of the end of the tax year in which the Company would claim a tax deduction in connection with such Award, specify that all or any portion of such Award is intended to satisfy the requirements for qualified performance-based compensation under Section 162(m). With respect to each such Award, the Committee shall establish, in writing, that the vesting and/or payment pursuant to the Award shall be conditioned on the attainment for the specified Performance Period of specified performance targets related to designated performance goals for such period selected by the Committee from among the Performance Criteria specified in Section 11.2. Such action shall be taken no later than the earlier of (a) the date 90 days after the commencement of the applicable Performance Period or (b) the date on which 25% of the Performance Period has elapsed and, in any event, at a time when the outcome of the performance goals remain substantially uncertain.
11.2 Performance Criteria
For purposes of this Section 11, the term "Performance Criteria" shall mean any one or more of the following performance criteria: profits (including, but not limited to, profit growth, net operating profit or economic profit); profit-related return ratios; return measures (including, but not limited to, return on assets, capital, equity or sales); cash flow (including, but not limited to, operating cash flow, free cash flow or cash flow return on capital); earnings (including, but not limited to, net earnings, earnings per share, or earnings before or after taxes); net sales growth; net income (before or after taxes, interest, depreciation and/or amortization); gross or operating margins; productivity ratios; share price (including, but not limited to, growth measures and total shareholder return); expense targets; margins; operating efficiency; customer satisfaction; and working capital targets.
11.3 Use and Calculation of Performance Criteria
Any Performance Criteria may be used to measure the performance of the Company as a whole or with respect to one or more business units, divisions, acquired businesses, minority investments, partnerships or joint ventures. Performance Criteria may be stated in absolute terms or relative to comparison companies or indices to be achieved during a period of time. Performance Criteria shall be calculated in accordance with the Company's financial statements or generally accepted accounting principles, or under a methodology established by the Committee prior to the issuance of an Award that is consistently applied and identified in the audited financial statements, including footnotes, or the Management's Discussion and Analysis section of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Committee shall have the right to specify, at the time the performance goals are established in accordance with this Section 11, that any Performance Criteria may be adjusted to exclude the impact of any Nonrecurring Item, provided that such Nonrecurring Item may be identified in the audited financial statements, including footnotes, or the Management's Discussion and Analysis section of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Page 8
11.4 Committee Certification and Authority
After the completion of each Performance Period, the Committee shall certify the extent to which any Performance Criteria has been satisfied, and the amount payable as a result thereof, prior to payment, settlement or vesting of any Award subject to this Section 11. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan other than Section 11, with respect to any Award subject to this Section 11, the Committee may adjust downwards, but not upwards, the amount payable pursuant to such Award.
The Committee shall have the power to impose such other restrictions on Awards subject to this Section 11 as it may deem necessary or appropriate to ensure that such Awards satisfy all requirements for "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m).
11.5 Maximum Awards
Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 15, and in accordance with the requirements under Section 162(m), no Participant shall receive in any one calendar year grants of Awards that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m), other than Options, Stock Appreciation Rights or Performance Units, covering an aggregate of more than 1 million shares of Common Stock.
In accordance with the requirements under Section 162(m), the maximum aggregate dollar amount paid to an individual Participant in any one calendar year pursuant to a Performance Unit or other cash-based Award that is intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) shall not exceed (i) 0.50% of the cumulative Adjusted Operating Cash Flow for the specific Performance Period for which the Award is granted for a Participant who is the Company's Chief Executive Officer and (ii) 0.20% of the cumulative Adjusted Operating Cash Flow for the specific Performance Period for which the Award is granted for any other Participant.
11.6 Options and SARs
Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 15, and in accordance with the requirements under Section 162(m), no Participant shall receive in any one calendar year grants of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights covering an aggregate of more than 2 million shares of Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, any Option or Stock Appreciation Right intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) shall have an exercise or grant price, as applicable, of no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock for the Grant Date, except in the case of Substitute Awards.
In addition to the Awards described in Sections 7 through 10, and subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee may grant other incentives payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock under the Plan as it determines to be in the best interests of the Company and subject to such other terms and conditions as it deems appropriate.
The Company may require a Participant to pay to the Company the amount of (a) any taxes that the Company is required by applicable federal, state, local or foreign law to withhold with respect to the grant, vesting or exercise of an Award ("tax withholding obligations") and (b) any amounts due from the Participant to the Company or to any Related Company ("other obligations"). The Company shall not be required to issue any shares of Common Stock under the Plan until such tax withholding obligations and other obligations are satisfied.
The Committee may permit or require a Participant to satisfy all or part of his or her tax withholding obligations and other obligations by (a) paying cash to the Company, (b) having the Company withhold an amount from any cash amounts otherwise due or to become due from the Company to the Participant, (c) having the Company withhold a number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued to the Participant (or become vested in the case of Restricted Stock) having a Fair Market Value equal to the tax withholding obligations and other obligations, or (d) surrendering a number of shares of Common Stock the Participant already owns having a value equal to the tax withholding obligations and other obligations.
 
Page 9
No Award or interest in an Award may be sold, assigned, pledged (as collateral for a loan or as security for the performance of an obligation or for any other purpose) or transferred by the Participant or made subject to attachment or similar proceedings otherwise than by will or by the applicable laws of descent and distribution, except that to the extent permitted by the Committee, in its sole discretion, a Participant may designate one or more beneficiaries on a Company-approved form who may receive payment under an Award after the Participant's death. During a Participant's lifetime, an Award may be exercised only by the Participant.
In the event, at any time or from time to time, a stock dividend, stock split, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, distribution to shareholders other than a normal cash dividend or other change in the Company's corporate or capital structure results in (a) the outstanding shares of Common Stock, or any securities exchanged therefor or received in their place, being exchanged for a different number or kind of securities of the Company or of any other company or (b) new, different or additional securities of the Company or of any other company being received by the holders of shares of Common Stock, then the Committee shall make proportional adjustments in (i) the maximum number and kind of securities available for issuance under the Plan; (ii) the maximum number and kind of securities issuable as Incentive Stock Options as set forth in Section 4.2; (iii) the maximum number and kind of securities that may be issued to an individual in any one calendar year as set forth in Section 4.3; (iv) the maximum number and kind of securities that may be made subject to the different types of Awards available under the Plan; and (v) the number and kind of securities that are subject to any outstanding Award and the per share price of such securities, without any change in the aggregate price to be paid therefor.
The determination by the Committee as to the terms of any of the foregoing adjustments shall be conclusive and binding.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, for cash or property, or for labor or services rendered, either upon direct sale or upon the exercise of rights or warrants to subscribe therefor, or upon conversion of shares or obligations of the Company convertible into such shares or other securities, shall not affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, outstanding Awards.
16.1 Amendment, Suspension or Termination of the Plan
The Board or the Committee may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan or any portion of the Plan at any time and in such respects as it shall deem advisable; provided, however, that, to the extent required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule, shareholder approval shall be required for any amendment to the Plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an amendment that constitutes a "material revision," as defined by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange shall be submitted to the Company's shareholders for approval. In addition, any revision that deletes or limits the scope of the provisions in Section 7.2 prohibiting repricing of options without shareholder approval and any revision that increases the number of shares stated in Section 4.1 as available for issuance under the Plan shall be considered material revisions that require shareholder approval.
16.2 Term of the Plan
Unless sooner terminated as provided herein, the Plan shall terminate ten years from the Effective Date. After the Plan is terminated, no future Awards may be granted, but Awards previously granted shall remain outstanding in accordance with their applicable terms and conditions and the Plan's terms and conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Incentive Stock Options may be granted more than ten years after the earlier of (a) the adoption of the Plan by the Board and (b) the Effective Date.
16.3 Consent of Participant
The amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan or a portion thereof or the amendment of an outstanding Award shall not, without the Participant's consent, materially adversely affect any rights under any Award theretofore granted to the Participant under
 
Page 10
the Plan. Any change or adjustment to an outstanding Incentive Stock Option shall not, without the consent of the Participant, be made in a manner so as to constitute a "modification" that would cause such Incentive Stock Option to fail to continue to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any adjustments made pursuant to Section 15 shall not be subject to these restrictions.
17.1 Clawback Policy
The Board shall, in all appropriate circumstances, require reimbursement of any annual incentive payment or long-term incentive payment under any Award to an executive officer where: (1) the payment was predicated upon achieving certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a substantial restatement of Company financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission; (2) the Board determines the executive engaged in intentional misconduct that caused or substantially caused the need for the substantial restatement; and (3) a lower payment would have been made to the executive based upon the restated financial results. In each such instance, the Company will, to the extent practicable, seek to recover from the individual executive the amount by which the individual executive's incentive payments for the relevant period exceeded the lower payment that would have been made based on the restated financial results. For purposes of this policy, the term "executive officer" means any officer who has been designated an executive officer by the Board.
17.2 No Individual Rights
No individual or Participant shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and the Company has no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Participants under the Plan.
Furthermore, nothing in the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan shall be deemed to constitute an employment contract or confer or be deemed to confer on any Participant any right to continue in the employ of, or to continue any other relationship with, the Company or any Related Company or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Related Company to terminate a Participant's employment or other relationship at any time, with or without cause.
17.3 Issuance of Shares
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Company shall have no obligation to issue or deliver any shares of Common Stock under the Plan or make any other distribution of benefits under the Plan unless, in the opinion of the Company's counsel, such issuance, delivery or distribution would comply with all applicable laws (including, without limitation, the requirements of the Securities Act or the laws of any state or foreign jurisdiction) and the applicable requirements of any securities exchange or similar entity.
The Company shall be under no obligation to any Participant to register for offering or resale or to qualify for exemption under the Securities Act, or to register or qualify under the laws of any state or foreign jurisdiction, any shares of Common Stock, security or interest in a security paid or issued under, or created by, the Plan, or to continue in effect any such registrations or qualifications if made. The Company may issue certificates for shares with such legends and subject to such restrictions on transfer and stop-transfer instructions as counsel for the Company deems necessary or desirable for compliance by the Company with federal, state and foreign securities laws. The Company may also require such other action or agreement by the Participants as may from time to time be necessary to comply with applicable securities laws.
To the extent the Plan or any instrument evidencing an Award provides for issuance of stock certificates to reflect the issuance of shares of Common Stock, the issuance may be effected on a noncertificated basis, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange.
17.4 Indemnification
Each person who is or shall have been a member of the Board, or a committee appointed by the Board, or an officer of the Company to whom authority was delegated in accordance with Section 3 shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from any loss, cost, liability or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by
 
Page 11
reason of any action taken or failure to act under the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in settlement thereof, with the Company's approval, or paid by him or her in satisfaction of any judgment in any such claim, action, suit or proceeding against him or her; provided, however, that he or she shall give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf, unless such loss, cost, liability or expense is a result of his or her own willful misconduct or except as expressly provided by statute.
The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled under the Company's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or of any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless.
17.5 No Rights as a Shareholder
Unless otherwise provided by the Committee or in the instrument evidencing the Award or in a written employment or services agreement, no Option or Award denominated in units shall entitle the Participant to any cash dividend, voting or other right of a shareholder unless and until the date of issuance under the Plan of the shares that are the subject of such Award.
17.6 Compliance With Laws and Regulations
Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may bifurcate the Plan so as to restrict, limit or condition the use of any provision of the Plan to Participants who are officers or directors subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act without so restricting, limiting or conditioning the Plan with respect to other Participants.
Additionally, in interpreting and applying the provisions of the Plan, any Option granted as an Incentive Stock Option pursuant to the Plan shall, to the extent permitted by law, be construed as an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of Code Section 422.
Additionally, notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan to the contrary, it is the Company's intention that any and all Awards and compensation payable under the Plan shall satisfy the requirements for exemption under Section 409A and that all terms and provisions shall be interpreted to satisfy such requirements. If the Committee determines that an Award, payment, distribution, deferral election, transaction or any other action or arrangement contemplated by the provisions of the Plan would, if undertaken, cause a Participant to become subject to Section 409A, the Committee, to the extent it deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, reserves the right , but shall not be required, to unilaterally amend or modify the Plan and any Award granted under the Plan so that the Award qualifies for exemption from or compliance with Section 409A. Awards not deferred under Section 6.3 and not otherwise exempt from the requirements of Section 409A are intended to qualify for the short-term deferral exemption to Section 409A, and payment shall be made as soon as administratively feasible after the Award became vested, but in no event shall such payment be made later than 2-1/2 months after the end of the calendar year in which the Award became vested unless otherwise permitted under the exemption provisions of Section 409A.
17.7 Participants in Other Countries
The Committee shall have the authority to adopt such modifications, procedures and subplans as may be necessary or desirable to comply with provisions of the laws of other countries in which the Company or any Related Company may operate to ensure the viability of the benefits from Awards granted to Participants employed in such countries, to comply with applicable foreign laws and to meet the objectives of the Plan.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 7.2 and 8.1, where applicable foreign law requires that compensatory stock right be priced based upon a specific price averaging method and period, a stock right granted in accordance with such applicable foreign law will be treated as meeting the requirements of Sections 7.2 or 8.1, provided that the averaging period does not exceed 30 days.
17.8 No Trust or Fund
The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan. Nothing contained herein shall require the Company to segregate any monies or other property, or shares of Common Stock, or to create any trusts, or to make any special deposits for any immediate or deferred amounts payable to any Participant, and no Participant shall have any rights that are greater than those of a general unsecured creditor of the Company.
 
Page 12
17.9 Successors
All obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Awards shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all the business and/or assets of the Company.
17.10 Severability
If any provision of the Plan or any Award is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or as to any person, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or, if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the Committee's determination, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or Award, and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.
17.11 Choice of Law
The Plan, all Awards granted thereunder and all determinations made and actions taken pursuant thereto, to the extent not otherwise governed by the laws of the United States, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law.
The Plan is amended and restated effective January 1, 2008 (the "Effective Date").

Any shares subject to an award granted under the Plan that is forfeited, terminated or canceled or, in the case of awards granted under Section 6.4, any shares that do not vest shall again be available for the granting of awards under the Plan. In instances where a stock appreciation right is settled in cash, the shares covered by such award shall remain available for the granting of other awards. Likewise, the payment of cash dividends and dividend equivalents paid in cash in conjunction with outstanding awards shall not be counted against the shares available for issuance.
4.3 Acquisitions
The Board, in its sole discretion, may increase the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered under Section 4.1 by up to three million (3,000,000) shares in the event the Company acquires any other corporation or business entity and the Company agrees to assume the acquired entity's obligations for outstanding stock options or stock grant commitments or otherwise grants awards to individuals in connection with such acquisition.
 
5. Adjustment of Shares Available
The aggregate numbers and kind of shares available for awards under the Plan, the maximum number and kind of shares that may be subject to awards to any individual under the Plan, the number and kind of shares covered by each outstanding award, and the exercise price per share (but not the total price) for stock options, stock appreciation rights or similar awards outstanding under the Plan shall all be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from any split-up, combination or exchange of shares, consolidation, spin-off or recapitalization of shares or any like capital adjustment or the payment of any stock dividend.
6. Awards
6.1 Types of Awards
The Committee shall have the authority, in its sole discretion, to determine the type or types of awards to be granted under the Plan. Such awards may include, but are not limited to, Incentive Stock Options, Nonqualified Stock Options (as defined in Section 6.2), stock appreciation rights or restricted stock awards. Such awards may be granted either alone, in addition to or in tandem with any other type of award granted under the Plan.
6.2 Stock Options
The Committee may grant stock options, designated as "Incentive Stock Options," which comply with the provisions of Section 422 of the Code or any successor statutory provision, or "Nonqualified Stock Options." The price at which shares may be purchased upon exercise of a particular option shall be determined by the Committee but shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of such shares at the time such option is granted. For purposes of the Plan, "Fair Market Value" as to a particular day equals the mean of the high and low per share trading prices for the Common Stock as reported for such day in or such other source as the Committee deems reliable. The Committee shall set the term of each stock option, but no Incentive Stock Option shall be exercisable more than 10 years after the date such option is granted and, to the extent the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the date the option is granted) of Common Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options granted to a particular individual become exercisable for the first time during any calendar year (under the Plan and all other stock option plans of the Company) exceeds $100,000 (or such corresponding amount as may be set by the Code), such options shall be treated as Nonqualified Stock Options.
The Wall Street Journal
6.3 Stock Appreciation Rights
The Committee may grant stock appreciation rights to individuals, either in tandem with stock options that have been or are granted under the Plan or with respect to a number of shares on which an option is not granted. A stock appreciation right shall entitle the holder to receive, with respect to each share of stock as to which the right is exercised, payment in an amount equal to the excess of the share's Fair Market Value on the date the right is exercised over its Fair Market Value on the date the right was granted. Such payment may be made in cash or in shares of Common Stock valued at the Fair Market Value as of the date of the surrender, or partly in cash and partly in shares of Common Stock, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. The Committee may establish a maximum appreciation value payable for stock appreciation rights.
 
6.4 Restricted Stock Awards
(a) The Committee may grant restricted stock awards under the Plan in Common Stock or denominated in units of Common Stock. The Committee, in its sole discretion, will make such awards subject to conditions and restrictions, as set forth in the instrument evidencing the award, which may be based on continuous service with the Company or the attainment of certain performance goals related to profits, profit growth, profit-related return ratios, cash flow or shareholder returns, where such goals may be stated in absolute terms or relative to comparison companies or indices to be achieved during a period of time. No more than three million (3,000,000) shares may be issued subject to restrictions based on continuous employment or services for less than three years (except where employment or services are terminated because an individual dies, retires, is laid off or becomes disabled).
(b) The Committee may choose, at the time of granting an award or at any time thereafter up to the time of payment of the award, to include as part of such award an entitlement to receive dividends or dividend equivalents, subject to such terms as the Committee may establish. All dividends or dividend equivalents that are not paid currently may, in the Committee's sole discretion, accrue interest and be paid to the participant if, when and to the extent such award is paid.
6.5 Payment; Deferral
Awards granted under the Plan may be settled through cash payments, the delivery of Common Stock or the granting of awards or combinations thereof as the Committee shall determine. Any award settlement, including payment deferrals, may be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee shall determine. The Committee may permit or require the deferral of any award payment, subject to such rules and procedures as it may establish, which may include provisions for the payment or crediting of interest, or dividend equivalents, including converting such credits to deferred stock unit equivalents. Notwithstanding the forgoing, any deferral made under this Section 6.5 will be made under a deferred compensation plan of the Company or pursuant to an employment agreement, either of which satisfies the requirements for exemption from or complies with Code Section 409A.
6.6. Dividend Equivalents
The right to any dividends or dividend equivalents declared and paid on the number of shares underlying an option or a stock appreciation right may not be contingent, directly or indirectly on the exercise of the option or stock appreciation right, and an award providing a right to dividends or dividend equivalents declared and paid on the number of shares underlying an option or a stock appreciation right, the payment of which is not contingent upon, or otherwise payable on, the exercise of the option or stock appreciation right, must comply with or qualify for an exemption under Code Section 409A.
7. Option Exercise
7.1 Employment or Service Requirement
Each award agreement or notice for a stock option or stock appreciation right shall contain a provision that the option or right shall not be exercisable unless the optionee remains in the Company's employ or service at least 12 months after the granting of the option or right.
7.2 Precondition to Stock Issuance
No shares shall be delivered pursuant to the exercise of any stock option or stock appreciation right, in whole or in part, until qualified for delivery under such securities laws and regulations as may be deemed
 
by the Committee to be applicable thereto and until, in the case of the exercise of an option, payment in full of the option price thereof (in cash or stock as provided in Section 7.4) is received by the Company. No holder of an option or stock appreciation right, or any legal representative, legatee or distributee shall be or be deemed to be a holder of any shares subject to such option or right unless and until such shares are issued.
7.3 No Fractional Shares
No stock option may at any time be exercised with respect to a fractional share. No fractional share shall be issued in the event shares are issued pursuant to the exercise of a stock appreciation right; however, a fractional stock appreciation right may be exercised for cash.
7.4 Form of Payment
An optionee may exercise a stock option using as the form of payment (a) cash or cash equivalent (b) stock-for-stock payment (as described in Section 7.5), (c) any combination of the above or (d) such other means as the Committee may approve.
7.5 Stock for Stock
An optionee who owns Common Stock may use such shares, the value of which shall be determined as the Fair Market Value of such shares on the date the stock option is exercised, as a form of payment to exercise stock options under the Plan. The Committee, in its sole discretion, may restrict or rescind this right by notice to optionees. A stock option may be exercised in such manner only by tendering (actually or by attestation) to the Company whole shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to or less than the exercise price. If an option is exercised by surrender of stock having a Fair Market Value less than the exercise price, the optionee must pay the difference in cash.
8. Transferability
The right of any award recipient to exercise an award granted under the Plan shall, during such recipient's lifetime, be exercisable only by such recipient, and shall not be assignable or transferable by such recipient other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
9. Withholding Taxes; Other Deductions
The Company shall have the right to deduct from any settlement of an award made under the Plan, including the delivery or vesting of shares, (a) an amount sufficient to cover withholding as required by law for any federal, state or local taxes and (b) any amounts due from the recipient of such award to the Company or to any subsidiary of the Company or to take such other action as may be necessary to satisfy any such withholding or other obligations, including withholding from any other cash amounts due or to become due from the Company to such recipient an amount equal to such taxes or obligations.
10. Termination of Employment or Services
The terms and conditions under which an award may be exercised following termination of a participant's employment or services with the Company shall be determined by the Committee; provided, that if a participant's employment or services terminate for any reason within 12 months of the grant date of a stock option or stock appreciation right, such option or right shall expire as of the date of such termination of employment or services and the participant and the participant's legal representative shall forfeit any and all rights pertaining to such award.
 
11. Term of the Plan
The Plan shall become effective as of May 1, 1997 and shall remain in full force and effect through April 30, 2007, unless sooner terminated by the Board. After the Plan is terminated, no future awards may be granted but awards previously granted shall remain outstanding in accordance with their applicable terms and conditions and the Plan's terms and conditions.

The Committee or the Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan at any time; provided that no such amendment shall be made without the approval of the Company's shareholders (a) that would increase the number of shares available for issuance in accordance with Section 4 or (b) if such approval is required (i) to comply with Section 422 of the Code with respect to Incentive Stock Options or (ii) for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code.
13. Bifurcation of the Plan
Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Board, in its sole discretion, may bifurcate the Plan so as to restrict, limit or condition the use of any provision of the Plan to participants who are officers subject to Section 16 of the 1934 Act without so restricting, limiting or conditioning the Plan with respect to other participants.
14. Code Section 409A
Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan to the contrary, it is the Company's intention that any and all awards and compensation payable under the Plan shall satisfy the requirements for exemption under Code Section 409A, and that all terms and provisions shall be interpreted to satisfy such requirements. If the Committee determines that an award, payment, distribution, deferral election, transaction or any other action or arrangement contemplated by the provisions of the Plan would, if undertaken, cause an award recipient to become subject to Code Section 409A, the Committee, to the extent it deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, reserves the right , but shall not be required, to unilaterally amend or modify the Plan and any Award granted under the Plan so that the Award qualified for an exemption from or compliance with Section 409A. Awards not deferred under Section 6.5 and not otherwise exempt from the requirements of Code Section 409A are intended to qualify for the short-term deferral exemption to Code Section 409A, and payment shall be made as soon as administratively feasible after the award became vested, but in no event shall such payment be made later than 2

9. GENERAL PROVISIONS
The Board shall, in all appropriate circumstances, require reimbursement of any annual incentive payment or long-term incentive payment under any award to an executive officer where: (1) the payment was predicated upon achieving certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a substantial restatement of Company financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission; (2) the Board determines the executive engaged in intentional misconduct that caused or substantially caused the need for the substantial restatement; and (3) a lower payment would have been made to the executive based upon the restated financial results. In each such instance, the Company will, to the extent practicable, seek to recover from the individual executive the amount by which the individual executive's incentive payments for the relevant period exceeded the lower payment that would have been made based on the restated financial results. For purposes of this policy, the term "executive officer" means any officer who has been designated an executive officer by the Board.
(a) Clawback Policy.
No individual or Participant shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and the Company has no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Participants under the Plan.

Furthermore, nothing in the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan shall be deemed to constitute an employment contract or confer or be deemed to confer on any Participant any right to continue in the employ of, or to continue any other relationship with, the Company or any Related Company or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Related Company to terminate a Participant's employment or other relationship at any time, with or without cause.
Unless otherwise provided by the Committee or in the instrument evidencing the Award or in a written employment or services agreement, no Award shall entitle the Participant to any dividend, voting or other right of a shareholder.
(c) No Rights as a Shareholder.
The Company shall have the right to withhold from the payment of any Award under the Plan any federal, state or local taxes in accordance with applicable law.
(d) Tax Withholding.
Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company or any Related Company from making awards or payments to a Participant under any other incentive plan or arrangement, whether generally or specifically applicable to such Participant, including any award or payment that does not qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m).
(e) Other Plans.
 Each person who is or shall have been a member of the Board or the Committee shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from any loss, cost, liability or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in settlement thereof, with the Company's approval, or paid by him or her in satisfaction of any judgment in
(f)
Indemnification.
 
any such claim, action, suit or proceeding against him or her; provided, however, that he or she shall give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf, unless such loss, cost, liability or expense is a result of his or her own willful misconduct or except as expressly provided by statute.
The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled under the Company's certificate of incorporation or by-laws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or of any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless.

 The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan. Nothing contained herein shall require the Company to segregate any monies or other property, or shares of common stock of the Company, or to create any trusts, or to make any special deposits for any immediate or deferred amounts payable to any Participant, and no Participant shall have any rights that are greater than those of a general unsecured creditor of the Company.
(h) No Trust or Fund.
 All obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Awards shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all the business and/or assets of the Company.
(i) Successors.
 If any provision of the Plan or any Award is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or as to any person, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or, if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the Committee's determination, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or Award, and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.
(j) Severability.

Exhibit 10.9
 
 
The Boeing Company established The Boeing Company Executive Layoff Benefits Plan to provide for lump sum payments as layoff benefits for its executive employees effective August 1, 1997. This document is an amendment and complete restatement of the Plan and is effective for Layoff Events occurring on or after January 1, 2008.

However, in the unlikely event that a portion of a Layoff Benefit payable to a Specified Employee is not exempt from the requirements of Code Section 409A (a "Non-Exempt Amount"), such Non-Exempt Amount will be paid to the Specified Employee as soon as practicable on or after the later of (i) the first day of the seventh month following the Specified Employee's Layoff Event, or (ii) the time specified in the paragraph above.
All payments under this Plan shall be net of any and all applicable withholding taxes, and interest shall not accrue on any portion of the Layoff Benefit, regardless of the time of payment.
