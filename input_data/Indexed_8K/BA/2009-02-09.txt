Boeing Statement Regarding 2008 10-K Earnings per Share Data
Boeing [NYSE: BA] today issued the following statement about the 2008 earnings per share data in its Form 10-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, also dated today, differing from that contained in its Jan. 28 earnings news release.
CHICAGO, Feb. 9, 2009 
"As reflected in our 10-K, our fourth-quarter and full-year 2008 per-share results are now four cents lower than was reported on Jan. 28, primarily because of two subsequent events that have been incorporated into the fourth-quarter results. The first was a reduction in the collateral values of aircraft in our customer financing portfolio due to the receipt of new third-party aircraft value publications. The second was a liabilities increase resulting from an arbitration award.
With those adjustments, our fourth-quarter 2008 loss now stands at 12 cents per share while our full-year 2008 earnings per share is $3.67."
