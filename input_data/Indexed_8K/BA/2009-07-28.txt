The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Purchasers may offer and sell Purchased Notes to or through any affiliate of a Purchaser and that any such affiliate may offer and sell Purchased Notes purchased by it to or through any Purchaser.
If we are acting as Representative(s) for the several Purchasers named in Schedule A hereto, we represent that we are authorized to act for such several Purchasers in connection with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, and that, if there are more than one of us, any action under this Agreement taken by any of us will be binding upon all the Purchasers.
All of the provisions contained in the document entitled "The Boeing Company Standard Purchase Provisions", a copy of which is attached hereto, are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety and shall be deemed to be a part of this Agreement to the same extent as if such provisions had been set forth in full herein, except that references in Section 10 of "The Boeing Company Standard Purchase Provisions" with respect to this Agreement only, are references to the 2015 Notes, the 2020 Notes, and 2040 Notes separately and Section 10 shall apply to each such series separately and not to all such series together.

Member State at any time under the following exemptions under the Prospectus Directive (as defined below), if they have been implemented in that Relevant Member State: (a) to legal entities which are authorized or regulated to operate in the financial markets or, if not so authorized or regulated, whose corporate purpose is solely to invest in securities; (b) to any legal entity which has two or more of (1) an average of at least 250 employees during the last financial year; (2) a total balance sheet of more than 43,000,000 and (3) an annual net turnover of more than 50,000,000, as shown in its last annual or consolidated accounts; (c) to fewer than 100 natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus Directive); or (d) in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive, provided that no such offer of Notes shall result in a requirement for the publication by the Company or any underwriter of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive. For purposes of this section, the expression an "offer of the Notes to the public" in relation to any Notes in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe to purchase the Notes, as the same may be varied in the Relevant Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Relevant Member State, and the expression Prospectus Directive means Directive 2003/71/EC and includes any relevant implementing measure in each Relevant Member State.
Each Purchaser hereby represents that, in connection with the distribution of the Notes, it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 ("FSMA") of the United Kingdom) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the Notes or any investments representing the Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Company and that it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.
Each Purchaser that is not a U.S. registered broker-dealer, represents that if it sells Notes in the United States it will do so through one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers as permitted by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority regulations.
Each Purchaser hereby agrees that it will not offer, sell or deliver any of the Notes in any jurisdiction outside the United States except under circumstances that will result in compliance with the applicable laws thereof, and that it will take at its own expense whatever action is required to permit its resale of the Notes in such jurisdictions. Each Purchaser understands that no action has been taken to permit a public offering in any jurisdiction outside the United States where action would be required for such purpose. Each Purchaser agrees not to cause any advertisement of the Notes to be published in any newspaper or periodical or posted in any public place and not to issue any circular relating to the Notes, except in any such case with the prior express written consent of the Company and of the Representatives and then only at its own risk and expense.

Covenants of the Purchasers
7. . The obligations of the several Purchasers to purchase and pay for the Purchased Notes will be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company herein, to the accuracy of the statements of Company officers made pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions precedent:
Conditions of the Obligations of the Purchasers
(a) On the date of execution of the Purchase Agreement and on the Closing Date, you shall have received from Deloitte & Touche LLP, independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Act Rules and Regulations, a letter, dated such a date, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to you containing statements and information of the type customarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus; provided that the letter delivered on the Closing Date shall use a "cut-off" date no more than three business days prior to the Closing Date.
 
(b) The Registration Statement shall remain effective and at the Closing Date, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been issued, no proceedings for such purpose shall have been instituted or, to the knowledge of the Company or you, shall be contemplated by the Commission and the Company has not received a notice of objection to the use of the Registration Statement as an automatic shelf registration statement. The Prospectus and each issuer "free writing prospectus" shall have been timely filed with the Commission under the Securities Act, as required; and all requests by the Commission for additional information shall have been complied with to the reasonable satisfaction of the Purchasers.
(c) Subsequent to the date of this Agreement, there shall not have occurred (A) any change or any development involving a prospective change not contemplated by the Time of Sale Prospectus as of the date of this Agreement in or affecting particularly the business or properties of the Company which, in the judgment of a majority in interest of the Purchasers including you, materially impairs the investment quality of the Purchased Notes, and (B) any downgrading in the rating of the Purchased Notes or any other debt securities or preferred stock of or guaranteed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the 1933 Act) or any public announcement that any such organization has under surveillance or review its rating of the Purchased Notes or any other debt securities or preferred stock of or guaranteed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries (other than an announcement with positive implications of a possible upgrading, and no implication of a possible downgrading, of such rating) or any announcement that the Company has been placed on negative outlook.
(d) You shall have received an opinion, dated the Closing Date, of a counsel for the Company, to the effect that:
(i) The Company has been duly incorporated or formed, and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware;
(ii) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid instrument, legally binding on the Company and enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and by general principles of equity;
(iii) The issuance and sale of the Purchased Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company. The Purchased Notes (assuming that they have been duly authenticated by the Trustee or a duly designated Authentication Agent under the Indenture, which fact counsel need not verify by an inspection of the Purchased Notes) have been duly issued and constitute legal, valid, and binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, and are entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture except as such enforceability or entitlement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and by general principles of equity;
(iv) The execution and delivery of the Purchase Agreement, the Indenture, and the Purchased Notes, the issuance and sale of the Notes to you in accordance with the Purchase Agreement do not (i) constitute a violation by the Company of any applicable provision of U.S federal laws or the laws of the State of New York (except that no opinion in this paragraph is being given as to compliance with any disclosure requirement or any prohibition against fraud or misrepresentation or as to whether performance of the indemnification or contribution provisions in the Purchase Agreement would be permitted);
 
(v) The Registration Statement is effective under the Securities Act and, (a) to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued, and no proceedings for such purpose have been instituted or are pending under the Securities Act; and (b) the Registration Statement (as of its effective date), the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus (as of the date of the Purchase Agreement and as of the Closing Date) and any amendments or supplements thereto, as of their respective dates, appeared to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of Form S-3 under the Securities Act and the Securities Act Rules and Regulations; provided that no opinion is expressed with respect to financial statements or other financial and statistical information contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus or incorporated therein or attached as an exhibit thereto or as to the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification on Form T-l of the Trustee under the Indenture.
(vi) The consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and the compliance by the Company with all the terms of the Indenture did not and will not result in a breach of any of the terms and provisions of, the Company's Charter or By-Laws or any indenture, mortgage or deed of trust or other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party which is filed as an exhibit to the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K;
(vii) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company; and
(viii) The statements set forth in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus under the caption "Description of the Debt Securities," and on the cover page of the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Indenture and the Purchased Notes, are accurate and fair summaries of the matters set forth therein. The statements in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus under the caption "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations," insofar as such statements constitute summaries of legal matters referred to therein, correctly summarize in all material respects the legal matters referred to therein.
(ix) To such counsel's knowledge, there are no legal or governmental proceedings that are pending against the Company or any of its subsidiaries or to which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject that has caused us to conclude that such proceeding is required by Item 103 of Regulation S-K to be described in the Registration Statement, Time of Sale Prospectus or Prospectus but is not so described.
(x) The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Purchased Notes and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus, will not be an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.
(xi) The documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Closing Date (other than the
 
financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they were filed with the Commission, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
(xii) The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.
In addition, such counsel shall state that such counsel has participated in conferences with officers, counsel and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company and representatives of the Purchasers at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed; and, although such counsel is not passing upon and does not assume responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus (except as to the matters referred to in their opinion rendered pursuant to subheading (ix) above), on the basis of the foregoing (relying as to matters of fact to a large extent upon the opinions of officers, counsel and other representatives of the Company), no facts have come to the attention of such counsel which lead such counsel to believe that (a) the Registration Statement, when it became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (b) the Time of Sale Information as of the Time of Sale and as of the date hereof, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (c) the Prospectus as of its date and as of the date hereof, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (it being understood that such counsel need make no comment with respect to the financial statements and other financial and statistical data included in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus or Prospectus or incorporated therein or as to the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification on Form T-l of the Trustee under the Indenture).
(e) The Purchasers shall have received from counsel for the Purchasers, an opinion dated the Closing Date, with respect to the matters as the Purchasers shall reasonably request and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they reasonably request for the purpose of enabling them to pass on such matters.

(g) The Company will furnish you with such conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and documents as you reasonably request.
In case any such condition shall not have been satisfied, this Agreement may be terminated by you upon notice in writing or by telecopy to the Company without liability or obligation on the part of the Company or any Purchaser, except as set forth in Section 12 hereof.
8. . The obligations of the Company to sell and deliver the Purchased Notes are subject to the following condition precedent:
Conditions of the Obligations of the Company
Prior to the Closing Date, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been issued and no proceedings for that purpose shall have been instituted or, to the knowledge of the Company or you, shall be contemplated by the Commission.

9. .
Indemnification
(a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Purchaser, its affiliates, as such term is defined in Rule 501(b) under the Securities Act (each, an "Affiliate"), each of its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls any Purchaser within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Purchaser, Affiliate or such controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus or any issuer "free writing prospectus" (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and will reimburse each Purchaser, Affiliate and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Purchaser, Affiliate or such controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable to such Purchaser, Affiliate or controlling person in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Purchaser specifically for use therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
(b) Each Purchaser agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act, or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the
 
Prospectus or any issuer "free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Purchaser specifically for use therein; and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which such Purchaser may otherwise have.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under (a) and (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section, except to the extent the indemnifying party has been materially prejudiced by such omission. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who may, with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party) and who shall not be counsel to any other indemnified party who may have interests conflicting with those of such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify each indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested that an indemnifying party reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the indemnifying party of such request and (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement unless the request is being disputed in good faith. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If recovery is not available under the foregoing indemnification provisions of this Section, for any reason other than as specified therein, the parties entitled to
 
indemnification by the terms thereof shall be entitled to contribution to liabilities and expenses, except to the extent that contribution is not permitted under Section 11(f) of the Act. In determining the amount of contribution to which the respective parties are entitled, there shall be considered the relative benefits received by each party from the offering of the Purchased Notes (taking into account the portion of the proceeds of the offering realized by each), the parties' relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted, the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission, and any other equitable considerations appropriate under the circumstances. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Purchasers on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Purchased Notes and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Purchasers in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Purchased Notes. The Company and the Purchasers and such controlling persons agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation (even if the Purchasers and such controlling persons were treated as one entity for such purpose). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Purchaser or controlling person shall be required to make contribution hereunder which in the aggregate exceeds the total public offering price of the Purchased Notes, purchased by the Purchaser under this Agreement, less the aggregate amount of any damages which such Purchaser or such controlling person has otherwise been required to pay in respect of the same claim or any substantially similar claim. The Purchasers' obligations to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
10. . If any Purchaser or Purchasers default in their obligations to purchase Purchased Notes hereunder and the aggregate principal amount of Purchased Notes which such defaulting Purchaser or Purchasers agreed but failed to purchase is 10% of the principal amount of Purchased Notes or less, the non-defaulting Purchasers may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Purchased Notes by other persons, including any of the Purchasers, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date the non-defaulting Purchasers shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder, to purchase the Purchased Notes which such defaulting Purchasers agreed but failed to purchase. If any Purchaser or Purchasers so default and the aggregate principal amount of Purchased Notes with respect to which such default or defaults occur is more than the above percentage and arrangements reasonably satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Purchased Notes by other persons are not made within seventy-two hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Purchaser or the Company, except as provided in Section 11. In the event that any Purchaser or Purchasers default in their obligation to purchase Purchased Notes hereunder, the Company may, by prompt written notice to the non-defaulting Purchasers, postpone the Closing Date for a period of not more than seven full business days in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents, and the Company will promptly file any amendments to the Registration Statement or supplements to the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus which may thereby be made necessary. As used in this Agreement, the term "Purchaser" includes any person substituted for a Purchaser under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Purchaser from liability for its default.
Default of Purchasers
11. . This Agreement may be terminated, by notice to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) trading of any securities issued or guaranteed by the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared
Termination
 
by federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement clearance services in the United States; or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in each case in the reasonable judgment of the Purchasers, is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Purchased Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus.
12. . The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties, and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the several Purchasers set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Purchaser or the Company or any of its officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Purchased Notes. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7, 8, 10 or 11 or if for any reason the purchase of the Purchased Notes by the Purchasers is not consummated, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 5(h). In addition, in such event the respective obligations of the Company and the Purchasers pursuant to Section 9 shall remain in effect; provided, however, that each Purchaser will use its best efforts to promptly notify each other Purchaser and each dealer and prospective customer to whom such Purchaser has delivered a Prospectus for the Purchased Notes by telephone or telegraph, confirmed by letter in either case, of such termination or failure to consummate, including in such notice instructions regarding the continued use of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto.
Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations

(b) The Company acknowledges that in connection with the offering of the Purchased Notes: (i) the Purchasers have acted at arm's-length, are not agents of, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Company or any other person, (ii) the Purchasers owe the Company only those duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement and prior written agreements to the extent not superseded by this Agreement), if any, and (iii) the Purchasers may have interests that differ from those of the Company. The Company waives to the full extent permitted by applicable law any claims it may have against the Purchasers arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offering of the Purchased Notes.
 
16. . This Purchase Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any conflicts of law provisions that would apply the laws of another jurisdiction.
Construction
17. . This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts and it is not necessary that the signatures of all parties appear on the same counterpart, but such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same agreement.
Counterparts
18. . No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, nor any consent or approval to any departure therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the parties hereto.
