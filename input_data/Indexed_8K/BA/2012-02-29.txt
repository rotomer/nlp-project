Exhibit 10.1
To:                     
As part of the Executive Compensation Program, The Boeing Company (the "Company") has awarded you a Restricted Stock Unit award. The terms and conditions of the award are as follows:
 
 
 
"Disability" here means a disability entitling a participant to benefits under a long-term disability policy sponsored by the Company or one of its subsidiaries.
 
 
5.1 While RSUs are in your account, they will earn dividend equivalents in the form of additional RSUs. Specifically, as of each dividend payment date for Boeing stock, your RSU account will be credited with additional RSUs ("Earnings Credit RSUs") equal in number to the number of shares of Boeing stock that could be bought with the cash dividends that would be paid on the RSUs in your account if each RSU were a share of Boeing stock. The number of RSUs that results from the Earnings Credit calculation will be to two decimal places.
5.2 The number of shares of Boeing stock that could be bought with such cash dividends will be calculated based on the "Fair Market Value" of Boeing stock on the applicable dividend payment date. "Fair Market Value" here means the average of the high and the low per share trading prices for Boeing stock as reported in for the specific dividend payment date, or in such other source as the Company deems reliable.

5.3 Earnings Credit RSUs will vest at the same time as the RSUs with which they are associated.
 
 
 
9.1 Distribution from your RSU account will be made as soon as reasonably possible after the vesting of your RSUs, but not later than 60 days after the applicable vesting date. Distribution will be in whole shares of Boeing stock. The number of shares distributed will be equal to the number of whole vested RSUs in your account, subject to deductions described in paragraph 9.2. Fractional share values will be applied to income tax withholding.
9.2 The Company will deduct from the distribution of your vested RSUs any withholding or other taxes required by law and may deduct any amounts due from you to the Company or to a subsidiary of the Company.
