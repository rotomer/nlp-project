On November 10, 2011, The Boeing Company (Boeing) entered into (1) a $2.3 billion, 364-day revolving credit agreement (the 364-Day Credit Agreement) and (2) a $2.3 billion, five-year revolving credit agreement (the 5-Year Credit Agreement and, together with the 364-Day Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreements), in each case with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as joint lead arrangers and joint book managers, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as syndication agent, Citibank, N.A. (the Agent) as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders as defined in the respective Credit Agreement. On October 15, 2012, the Agent notified Boeing that the lenders have agreed to Boeing's request to extend each Credit Agreement for an additional 364 days (one year, in the case of the 5-Year Credit Agreement) pursuant to the terms of the respective agreements. The 364-Day Credit Agreement is now scheduled to terminate on November 7, 2013, subject to Boeing's right to, following payment of additional fees, convert outstanding borrowings into term loans with a maturity date of November 7, 2014. The 5-Year Credit Agreement is now scheduled to terminate on November 10, 2017. The Credit Agreements are otherwise subject to the same terms and conditions as previously disclosed in Boeing's Form 8-K dated November 10, 2011.
