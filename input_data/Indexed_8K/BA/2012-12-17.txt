Boeing Raises Dividend 10 Percent and Resumes $3.6 Billion Share Repurchase Program
CHICAGO, Dec. 17, 2012 - Boeing [NYSE: BA] Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNerney announced a 10 percent increase in the company's regular quarterly dividend to 48.5 cents per share and the resumption of its stock repurchase program with repurchases currently expected to total between $1.5 billion and $2.0 billion in 2013.
Strong cash generation, consistently solid core operating performance and a positive growth outlook enable us to take these steps to deliver value for our shareholders, McNerney said. As returns accelerate on the investments we made in innovative new products, we plan to continue our balanced cash deployment strategy, increasing returns to shareholders, investing in our core businesses and our workforce, and maintaining a strong balance sheet with healthy credit ratings.
The repurchase program is expected to use the remaining $3.6 billion previously authorized by the Boeing board of directors in October 2007. Boeing plans to begin repurchasing shares following its fourth-quarter earnings announcement in late January 2013.
Boeing plans to make the share repurchases on the open market. The number and timing of shares to be purchased will be based on the level of cash balances, general business conditions and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities. The repurchase program also may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
The dividend is payable March 8, 2013, to shareholders of record as of Feb. 15, 2013.
