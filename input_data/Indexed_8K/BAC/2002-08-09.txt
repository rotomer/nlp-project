The Offerors will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment.
 
(b)    Prior to the termination of the offering of the Capital Securities, the Offerors (1) will give the Representative notice of their intention to file or prepare (i) any amendment to the Registration Statement (including any post-effective amendment) (other than with respect to a document filed with the Commission pursuant to the 1934 Act which will be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus), or (ii) any amendment or supplement to the Final Prospectus (including any revised prospectus which the Offerors propose for use by the Underwriters in connection with the offering of the Capital Securities which differs from the prospectus on file at the Commission at the time the Registration Statement became effective, whether or not such revised prospectus is required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations) (other than with respect to a document filed with the Commission pursuant to the 1934 Act which will be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus), will furnish the Representative with copies of any such amendment, supplement or other document within a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing or use, as the case may be, and will not file any such amendment, supplement or other document or use any such prospectus to which the Underwriters or counsel for the Underwriters shall reasonably object and (2) will furnish the Representative with copies of any document that will be incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus whether pursuant to the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or otherwise. Subject to the foregoing, the Offerors will file the Final Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) and Rule 430A under the 1933 Act not later than the Commission's close of business on the second business day following the execution and delivery of this Agreement.
 
(c)    The Offerors will deliver to the Representative as many signed copies of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein) as the Representative may reasonably request and will also deliver to the Representative a conformed copy of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto (without exhibits) for each of the Underwriters.
 
(d)    The Offerors will furnish to each Underwriter, from time to time during the period when the Final Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act, such number of copies of the Final Prospectus (as amended or supplemented) as such Underwriter may reasonably request for the purposes contemplated by the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations.
 
(e)    If at any time when the Final Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Capital Securities, except with respect to any such delivery requirement imposed upon an affiliate of the Offerors in connection with any secondary market sales, any event shall occur as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then amended or supplemented will include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading or if it shall be necessary to amend or supplement the Final Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations, the Offerors will, subject to paragraph (b) above, promptly prepare and file with the Commission such amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment which will effect such compliance, give immediate notice, and confirm in writing, to the Underwriters to cease the solicitation of offers to purchase the Capital Securities, and furnish to the Underwriters a reasonable number of copies of such amendment or supplement.
 
(f)    The Offerors will endeavor, in cooperation with the Underwriters, to qualify the Capital Securities (and the Capital Securities Guarantee) and the Junior Subordinated Notes for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and the other jurisdictions of the United States as the Underwriters may designate; provided, however, that none of the Offerors shall be obligated to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified.
 
(g)    The Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Underwriters as soon as practicable, but not later than 90 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement (which need not be audited) of the Company and its subsidiaries, covering an applicable period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the "Effective Date" (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the 1933 Act) of the Registration Statement, which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the 1933 Act.
 
(h)    The Offerors will use reasonable efforts to effect the listing of the Capital Securities on the New York Stock Exchange; if the Capital Securities are exchanged for Junior Subordinated Notes, the Company will use its reasonable efforts to effect the listing of the Junior Subordinated Notes on the exchange on which the Capital Securities were then listed.
 
(i)    The Company, during the period when the Final Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act, will file promptly all documents required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act.

do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations thereunder;

(f)    At the Closing Time, counsel for the Underwriters shall have been furnished with such documents and opinions as they may require for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon the issuance and sale of the Initial Capital Securities as herein contemplated and related proceedings, or in order to evidence the accuracy of any of the representations or warranties, or the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained; and all proceedings taken by the Offerors, in connection with the issuance and sale of the Initial Capital Securities as herein contemplated shall be satisfactory in form and substance to the Representative and Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP, counsel for the Underwriters.

SECTION 6.    INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION
 
(a)    The Offerors jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or arise out of or are based upon omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Final Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that (i) the Offerors will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Offerors by or on
 
behalf of any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arises out of or is based upon statements in or omissions from that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification of the Trustee (Form T-1) under the 1939 Act of any Trustee, and (ii) such indemnity with respect to the Basic Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter (or any person controlling such Underwriter) from whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the Capital Securities which are the subject thereof if such person did not receive a copy of the Final Prospectus (or the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented) excluding documents incorporated therein by reference at or prior to the confirmation of the sale of such Capital Securities to such person in any case where such delivery is required by the 1933 Act and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in any preliminary Final Prospectus was corrected in the Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Offerors may otherwise have.
 
(b)    Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Trust, the Trustees, each of the Company's directors, each of the Company's officers who signs the Registration Statement and each of the Trustees who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company or the Trust within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Offerors to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Offerors by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereof. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Offerors acknowledge that (i) the names of the Underwriters and the statements required by Item 508 of Regulation S-K set forth in the language on the cover page or under the heading "Underwriting", (ii) the sentences relating to concessions and reallowances, and (iii) the paragraph related to stabilization and syndicate covering transactions in the Final Prospectus, constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, and the Representative confirms that such statements are correct.
 
(c)    Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which
 
are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 6 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to local counsel), approved by the Representative in the case of subparagraph (a), representing the indemnified parties under subparagraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii).
 
(d)    To provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) of this Section 6 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Offerors on the grounds of policy or otherwise, the Offerors and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Offerors and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion so that the Underwriters are responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the underwriting discount bears to the sum of such discount and the purchase price of the Securities specified in Schedule B hereto and the Offerors are responsible for the balance; provided, however, that (y) in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Capital Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount applicable to the Capital Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and (z) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 6, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls either of the Offerors within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, each officer or trustee of the Offerors who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director or trustee of the Offerors shall have the same rights to contribution as the Offerors, subject in each case to clause (y) of this paragraph (d). Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d).
 
(e)    The Company agrees to indemnify the Trust against all losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred by the Trust under Section 6(a) hereof.
 
SECTION 7.    TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT.    This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representative, by notice given to the Offerors prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, or (ii) a banking moratorium or a material disruption in the commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities, or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or material escalation of hostilities or other calamity or crisis (in the United States or elsewhere) the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representative, impracticable to market the Securities.
 
SECTION 8.    DEFAULT BY ONE OR MORE OF THE UNDERWRITERS.    If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Time or at the Option Closing Time, as the case may be, to purchase the Capital Securities that it or they are obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), the Representative shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representative shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then:
 
(a)    if the number of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the Initial Capital Securities or the Option Capital Securities, as the case may be, each of the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or
 
(b)    if the number of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the Initial Capital Securities or the Option Capital Securities, as the case may be, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
 
No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
 
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representative or the Offerors shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time or the Option Closing Time, as the case may be, for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.
 
SECTION 9.    NOTICES.    All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication.

SECTION 10.    PARTIES.    This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Underwriters, the Trust, and the Company and their respective successors. Nothing expressed or mentioned in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any person, firm or corporation, other than the Underwriters and the Trust and the Company and their respective successors and the controlling persons and officers, directors and trustees referred to in Section 6 and their heirs and legal representatives, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision herein contained.

Upon any such presentation, the Company shall execute a Global Note in such aggregate principal amount and deliver the same to the Trustee for authentication and delivery in accordance with the Indenture and this Third Supplemental Indenture. Payments on the Notes issued as a Global Note will be made to the Depositary; and

On issue of such Notes, Notes with an equivalent aggregate principal amount that were presented by the Property Trustee to the Trustee will be deemed to have been canceled.
 
(b)    A Global Note may be transferred, in whole but not in part, only to another nominee of the Depositary, or to a successor Depositary selected or approved by the Company or to a nominee of such successor Depositary.
 
(c)    If at any time the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary or if at any time the Depositary shall no longer be registered or in good standing under the Exchange Act or other applicable statute or regulation, and a successor Depositary for such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such condition, as the case may be, the Company will execute, and, subject to Article 2 of the Indenture, the Trustee, upon written notice from the Company, will authenticate and make available for delivery the Notes in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, and in an aggregate principal

Upon the exchange of the Global Note for such Notes in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, the Global Note shall be canceled by the Trustee. Such Notes in definitive registered form issued in exchange for the Global Note shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver such Notes to the Depositary for delivery to the Persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.

Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if the Capital Securities are no longer in book-entry only form, the relevant record dates shall be February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1 prior to the regular Interest Payment Date.
 
(b)    The amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. Except as provided in the following sentence, the amount of interest payable for any period shorter than a full quarterly period for which interest is computed, will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in such a 30-day period. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date.
 
(c)    If, at any time while the Property Trustee is the Holder of any Notes, the Trust or the Property Trustee is required to pay any taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature (other than withholding taxes) imposed by the United States, or any other domestic taxing authority, then, in any case, the Company will pay as additional interest ("Additional Interest") on the Notes held by the Property Trustee, such additional amounts as shall be required so that the net amounts received and retained by the Trust and the Property
Trustee after paying such taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges will be equal to the amounts the Trust and the Property Trustee would have received had no such taxes, duties, assessments or other government charges been imposed.

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Company Indemnified Person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
nolo contendere
 
(ii)    The Note Issuer shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any Company Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Trust to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a Company Indemnified Person against expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust and except that no such indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such Company Indemnified Person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Trust unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
 
(iii)    To the extent that a Company Indemnified Person shall be successful on the merits or otherwise (including dismissal of an action without prejudice or the settlement of an action without admission of liability) in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified, to the full extent permitted by law, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.
 
(iv)    Any indemnification under paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a) (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Note Issuer only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the
 
Company Indemnified Person is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in paragraphs (i) and (ii). Such determination shall be made (1) by the Regular Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of such Regular Trustees who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the Holders of the Common Securities.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance shall be made by the Note Issuer if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Regular Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees, (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iii) the Common Security Holder of the Trust, that, based upon the facts known to the Regular Trustees, counsel or the Common Security Holder at the time such determination is made, such Company Indemnified Person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such Company Indemnified Person believed or had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. In no event shall any advance be made in instances where the Regular Trustees, independent legal counsel or Common Security Holder reasonably determine that such person deliberately breached his duty to the Trust or to the Holders of the Common or Capital Securities.
 
(vi)    The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other paragraphs of this Section 10.4(a) shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification and advancement of expenses may be entitled under any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors of the Note Issuer or Capital Security Holders of the Trust or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. All rights to indemnification under this Section 10.4(a) shall be deemed to be provided by a contract between the Note Issuer and each Company Indemnified Person who serves in such capacity at any time while this Section 10.4(a) is in effect. Any repeal or modification of this Section 10.4(a) shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing.
 
(vii)    The Note Issuer or the Trust may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Company Indemnified Person
 
against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Note Issuer would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Section 10.4(a).
 
(viii)    For purposes of this Section 10.4(a), references to "the Trust" shall include, in addition to the resulting or surviving entity, any constituent entity (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger, so that any person who is or was a director, trustee, officer or employee of such constituent entity, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent entity as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of another entity, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Section 10.4(a) with respect to the resulting or surviving entity as he would have with respect to such constituent entity if its separate existence had continued.
 
(ix)    The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Section 10.4(a) shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Company Indemnified Person and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
 
(b)    The Note Issuer agrees to indemnify the (i) Property Trustee, (ii) the Delaware Trustee, (iii) any Affiliate of the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, and (iv) any officers, directors, shareholders, members, partners, employees, representatives, custodians, nominees or agents of the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee (each of the Persons in (i) through (iv) being referred to as a "Fiduciary Indemnified Person") for, and to hold each Fiduciary Indemnified Person harmless against, any and all loss, liability, damage, claim or expense including taxes (other than taxes based on the income of such Fiduciary Indemnified Person) incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the trust or trusts hereunder, including the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) of defending itself against or investigating any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder.

(iii)    each meeting of the Holders of the Securities shall be conducted by the Regular Trustees or by such other Person that the Regular Trustees may designate; and
 
(iv)    unless the Business Trust Act, this Declaration, the terms of the Securities, the Trust Indenture Act or the listing rules of any stock exchange on which the Capital Securities are then listed or trading otherwise provide, the Regular Trustees, in their sole discretion, shall establish all other provisions relating to meetings of Holders of Securities, including notice of the time, place or purpose of any meeting at which any matter is to be voted on by any Holders of Securities, waiver of any such notice, action by consent without a meeting, the establishment of a record date, quorum requirements, voting in person or by proxy or any other matter with respect to the exercise of any such right to vote.

Pursuant to Section 7.1 of the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, dated as of August 2, 2002 (as amended from time to time, the "Declaration"), the designation, rights, privileges, restrictions, preferences and other terms and provisions of the Capital Securities and the Common Securities are set out below (each capitalized term used but not defined herein has the meaning set forth in the Declaration);
 
1.    
Designation and Number.
 
(a)    .    The Capital Securities of the Trust (liquidation amount $25 per Capital Security) are hereby designated for purposes of identification only as "BAC Capital Trust III 7% Capital Securities" (the "Capital Securities"). Initially, the Trust shall issue 18,000,000 Capital Securities with an aggregate liquidation amount of $450,000,000. The Capital Security Certificates evidencing the Capital Securities shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 to the Declaration, with such changes and additions thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary usage, custom or practice or to conform to the rules of any stock exchange on which the Capital Securities are listed.
Capital Securities
 
(b)    .    The Common Securities of the Trust (liquidation amount $25 per Security) are hereby designated for purposes of identification only as "BAC Capital Trust III 7% Common Securities" (the "Common Securities"). Initially, the Trust shall issue 560,000 Common Securities with an aggregate liquidation amount of $14,000,000. The Common Security Certificates evidencing the Common Securities shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2 to the Declaration, with such changes and additions thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary usage, custom or practice.
Common Securities
 
(c)    Upon exercise of the Option by the Underwriters, the Trust may issue up to an additional 2,700,000 Capital Securities and up to an additional 84,000 Common Securities. References in this Designation of Terms or in the Declaration to Securities, Capital Securities or Common Securities shall include the Securities so issued. At the time of the issue of additional Securities, the Trust and the Sponsor shall execute a certificate in the form of Annex A-I to the Declaration.
 
2.    
Distributions.
 
(a)    Distributions payable on each Security will be fixed at a rate per annum of 7% (the "Coupon Rate") of the stated liquidation amount of $25 per Security, such rate being the interest rate payable on the Notes to be held by the Property Trustee. Distributions in arrears for more than one quarterly period will bear interest thereon compounded quarterly at the Coupon
Rate (to the extent permitted by applicable law). A Distribution is payable only to the extent that payments are made in respect of the Notes held by the Property Trustee and to the extent the Property Trustee has funds available therefor. The amount of Distributions payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The amount of Distributions payable for any period shorter than a full distribution period will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
 
(b)    Distributions on the Securities will be cumulative, will accrue from August 9, 2002 and will be payable quarterly in arrears, on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on November 15, 2002, except as otherwise described below. The Note Issuer has the right under the Indenture to defer payments of interest on the Notes by extending the interest payment period from time to time on the Notes for a period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarterly periods (each an "Extension Period"), during which Extension Period no interest shall be due and payable on the Notes, no Extension Period may extend beyond the Stated Maturity. As a consequence of such deferral, Distributions also will be deferred on the Capital Securities for the same period. Despite such deferral, quarterly Distributions will continue to accrue with interest thereon (to the extent permitted by applicable law) at the Coupon Rate compounded quarterly during any such Extension Period. Prior to the termination of any such Extension Period, the Note Issuer may extend further such Extension Period; such Extension Period together with all such previous and further extensions thereof may not exceed 20 consecutive quarterly periods or extend beyond the Stated Maturity. Payments of accrued Distributions will be payable to Holders as they appear on the books and records of the Trust or the Clearing Agency, as the case may be, on the first record date after the end of the Extension Period. Upon the termination of any Extension Period and the payment of all amounts then due, the Note Issuer may commence a new Extension Period, subject to the above requirements. No interest shall be due and payable during an Extension Period, except at the end thereof, but the Note Issuer may repay at any time all or any portion of the interest accrued during an Extension Period.
provided that
provided that
 
(c)    Distributions on the Securities will be payable to the Holders thereof as they appear on the books and records of the Trust on the relevant record dates. While the Capital Securities remain in Book-Entry only form, the relevant record dates shall be one Business Day prior to the relevant payment dates, which payment dates correspond to the interest payment dates on the Notes. Payment of Distributions on the Securities held in Book-Entry only form will be made to the Depositary in immediately available funds. The Depositary's practice is to credit Clearing Agency Participants' accounts on the relevant payment date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on the Depositary's records unless the Depositary has reason to believe that it will not receive payments on such payment date. Payments by (i) Clearing Agency Participants and (ii) securities brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies and other entities that clear transactions through or maintain a direct or indirect custodial relationship with a Clearing Agency Participant (an "Indirect Participant") to Capital Security Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of such Clearing Agency Participants and Indirect Participants and not of the Depositary, the Trust or the Corporation, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of distributions to the Depositary is the responsibility of the Trust, disbursement of such payments to Clearing Agency Participants is the responsibility of the Depositary, and disbursement of such payments to the Capital Security Beneficial Owners is the
responsibility of the Clearing Agency Participants and Indirect Participants. The relevant record dates for the Common Securities shall be the same record date as for the Capital Securities. If the Capital Securities shall no longer remain in Book-Entry only form, the regular record dates for the Capital Securities shall be the February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1 prior to the relevant payment dates, which payment dates correspond to the interest payment dates on the Notes. Distributions payable on any Securities that are not punctually paid on any Distribution payment date, as a result of the Note Issuer having failed to make a payment under the Notes, will cease to be payable to the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the relevant record date, and such defaulted Distribution will instead be payable to the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the special record date or other specified date determined in accordance with the Indenture. If any date on which Distributions are payable on the Securities is not a Business Day, then payment of the Distribution payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date.
 
(d)    In the event that there is any money or other property held by or for the Trust that is not accounted for hereunder, such property shall be distributed Pro Rata (as defined herein) among the Holders of the Securities.
 
3.    
Liquidation Distribution Upon Dissolution.
 
In the event of any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, winding-up or termination of the Trust, the Holders on the date of the dissolution, winding-up or termination, as the case may be, will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Trust available for distribution to Holders after satisfaction of liabilities of creditors an amount equal to the aggregate of the stated liquidation amount of $25 per Security plus accrued and unpaid Distributions thereon to the date of payment (such amount being the "Liquidation Distribution"), unless, in connection with such dissolution, winding-up or termination, Notes in an aggregate stated principal amount equal to the aggregate stated liquidation amount of such Securities, with an interest rate equal to the Coupon Rate of, and bearing accrued and unpaid interest in an amount equal to the accrued and unpaid Distributions on, such Securities, shall be distributed on a Pro Rata basis to the Holders of the Securities in exchange for such Securities.
 
If, upon any such dissolution, the Liquidation Distribution can be paid only in part because the Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then the amounts payable directly by the Trust on the Securities shall be paid on a Pro Rata basis. Holders of the Common Securities will be entitled to receive distributions upon any such dissolution Pro Rata with Holders of the Capital Securities, except that if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Capital Securities shall have a preference over the Common Securities with respect to such distributions.
 
4.    
Redemption and Distribution.
 
(a)    The Securities are subject to redemption at the Stated Maturity, at any time after August 15, 2007 and in certain circumstances, following the occurrence of a Special Event as follows:
 
(i)    Upon payment of the Notes at a payment price equal to the principal amount of, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon at the Stated Maturity, the proceeds from such payment shall be applied simultaneously to redeem the Securities at the Maturity Redemption Price.
 
(ii)    In the event of a Special Event Prepayment prior to August 15, 2007, the proceeds from such Special Event Prepayment shall be applied simultaneously to redeem the Capital Securities at the Special Event Redemption Price.
 
(iii)    The Securities also may be redeemed in whole or in part on or after August 15, 2007, contemporaneously with an optional prepayment of the Notes at a redemption price equal to the Optional Redemption Price. If fewer than all the outstanding Securities are to be so redeemed, the Common Securities and the Capital Securities will be redeemed Pro Rata and the Capital Securities to be redeemed will be as described in Section 4(d)(ii) below.
 
(b)    If the Sponsor has given a notice of its election to terminate the Trust, the Regular Trustees shall dissolve the Trust and, after satisfaction of creditors, cause Notes held by the Property Trustee, having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate stated liquidation amount of the Securities, with an interest rate equal to the Coupon Rate of, and bearing accrued and unpaid interest in an amount equal to the accrued and unpaid Distributions on, and having the same record date for payment as, the Securities, to be distributed to the Holders of the Securities in liquidation of such Holders' interests in the Securities within 90 days following receipt of the Sponsor's notice of election.
 
(c)    On and from the date fixed by the Regular Trustees for any distribution of Notes and dissolution of the Trust: (i) the Securities will no longer be deemed to be outstanding, (ii) the Depositary or its nominee as the record Holder of the Capital Securities, will receive a registered Global Security or Securities representing the Notes to be delivered upon such distribution and any certificates representing Securities, except for certificates representing Capital Securities held by the Depositary or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee), will be deemed to represent beneficial interests in the Notes having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate stated liquidation amount of, with an identical interest rate, and accrued and unpaid interest equal to accrued and unpaid Distributions on such Securities until such certificates are presented to the Note Issuer or its agent for transfer or reissue. The Trust may not redeem fewer than all the outstanding Securities unless all accrued and unpaid Distributions have been paid on all Securities for all quarterly Distribution periods terminating on or before the date of redemption. If the Notes are distributed to holders of the Securities, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Note Issuer will use its best efforts to have the Notes listed on the securities exchange, if any, on which the Capital Securities were listed immediately prior to the distribution of the Notes.
 
(d)    Redemption or Distribution Procedures shall be as follows:
 
(i)    A Redemption/Distribution Notice for the Securities to be redeemed or exchanged will be given by the Trust by mail to each Holder not fewer than 15 nor more than 60 days before the redemption date or exchange date which, in the case of a redemption, will be the date fixed for redemption of the Notes. For purposes of the calculation of the redemption date or exchange date and the dates on which notices are given pursuant to this Section 4(d)(i), a Redemption/ Distribution Notice shall be deemed to be given on the day such notice is first mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to Holders of Securities. Each Redemption/Distribution Notice shall be addressed to the Holders of Securities at the address of each such Holder appearing in the books and records of the Trust. No defect in the Redemption/Distribution Notice or in the mailing of either with respect to any Holder shall affect the validity of the redemption or exchange proceedings with respect to any other Holder.
 
(ii)    In the event that fewer than all the outstanding Securities are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be redeemed Pro Rata from each Holder of Capital Securities, it being understood that, in respect of Capital Securities registered in the name of and held of record by the Depositary or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee) or any nominee, the distribution of the redemption proceeds will be made to each Clearing Agency Participant (or Person on whose behalf such nominee holds such securities) in accordance with the procedures applied by such agency or nominee.
 
(iii)    If Securities are to be redeemed and the Trust gives a Redemption/Distribution Notice, which notice may only be issued if the Notes are repaid as set out in this Section 4 (which notice will be irrevocable), then (A) while the Capital Securities are in Book-Entry only form, with respect to the Capital Securities, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the redemption date, provided that the Note Issuer has paid the Property Trustee a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the related prepayment or maturity of the Notes, the Property Trustee will deposit irrevocably with the Depositary or its nominee (or successor Clearing Agency or its nominee) funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price with respect to the Capital Securities and will give the Depositary irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of the Capital Securities, and (B) with respect to Capital Securities issued in definitive form and Common Securities, provided that the Note Issuer has paid the Property Trustee a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the related prepayment or maturity of the Notes, the Property Trustee will pay the relevant Redemption Price to the Holders of such Securities by check mailed to the address of the relevant Holder appearing on the books and records of the Trust on the redemption date. If a Redemption/Distribution Notice shall have been given and funds deposited as required, if applicable, then immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such deposit, or on the redemption date, as applicable, Distributions will cease to accrue on the Securities so called for redemption and all rights of Holders of such Securities so called for redemption will cease, except the right of the Holders of such Securities to receive the Redemption Price, but without interest on such Redemption Price. Neither the Regular Trustees nor the Trust shall be required to register or cause to be registered the transfer of
any Securities that have been so called for redemption. If any date fixed for redemption of Securities is not a Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day falls in the next calendar year, such payment will be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date fixed for redemption. If payment of the Redemption Price in respect of any Securities is improperly withheld or refused and not paid either by the Property Trustee or by the Sponsor as guarantor pursuant to the relevant Securities Guarantee, Distributions on such Securities will continue to accrue from the original redemption date to the actual date of payment, in which case the actual payment date will be considered the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the Redemption Price.
 
(iv)    Redemption/Distribution Notices shall be sent by the Regular Trustees on behalf of the Trust to (A) in respect of the Capital Securities, the Depositary or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee) if the Global Securities have been issued or, if Definitive Capital Security Certificates have been issued, to the Holder thereof, and (B) in respect of the Common Securities to the Holder thereof.
 
(v)    Subject to the foregoing and applicable law (including, without limitation, United States federal securities laws), provided the acquiror is not the Holder of the Common Securities or the obligor under the Indenture, the Sponsor or any of its subsidiaries may at any time and from time to time purchase outstanding Capital Securities by tender, in the open market or by private agreement.

Distributions payable on each Capital Security will be fixed at a rate per annum of 7% (the "Coupon Rate") of the stated liquidation amount of $25 per Capital Security, such rate being the rate of interest payable on the Notes to be held by the Property Trustee on behalf of the Trust. Distributions in arrears for more than one quarter will bear interest thereon compounded quarterly at the Coupon Rate (to the extent permitted by applicable law). A Distribution is payable only to the extent that payments are made in respect of the Notes held by the Property Trustee and to the extent the Property Trustee has funds available therefor. The amount of Distributions payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
 
Except as otherwise described below, Distributions on the Capital Securities will be cumulative, will accrue from the date of original issuance and will be payable quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on November 15, 2002 to the person in whose name the Capital Security is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such installment, which shall be the close of business on the Business Day next preceding such payment date[IF PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE DECLARATION, THE SECURITIES ARE NO LONGER REPRESENTED BY A GLOBAL SECURITYwhich shall be the close of business on February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1 prior to the relevant payment date.] The Note Issuer has the right under the Indenture to defer payments of interest by extending the interest payment period from time to time on the Notes for a period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarterly periods (each an "Extension Period"), no Extension Period shall last beyond the date of the maturity of the Notes. As a consequence of such deferral, Distributions will also be deferred hereunder for the same period. Despite such deferral, quarterly Distributions will continue to accrue with interest thereon (to the extent permitted by applicable law) at the Coupon Rate compounded quarterly during any such Extension Period. Prior to the termination of any such Extension Period, the Note Issuer may further extend such Extension Period; such Extension Period together with all such previous and further extensions thereof may not exceed 20 consecutive quarterly periods or extend beyond the maturity date of the Notes. Payments of accrued Distributions will be payable to Holders as they appear on the books and records of the Trust on the first record date after the end of the Extension Period.

BAC CAPITAL TRUST III, a statutory business trust formed under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Trust"), hereby certifies that BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION (the "Holder") is the registered owner of                 common securities of the Trust representing undivided common beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust designated the 7% Common Securities (liquidation amount $25 per Common Security) (the "Common Securities"). The Common Securities are transferable on the books and records of the Trust, in person or by a duly
authorized attorney, upon surrender of this certificate duly endorsed and in proper form for transfer. The designation, rights, privileges, restrictions, preferences and other terms and provisions of the Common Securities represented hereby are issued and shall in all respects be subject to the provisions of the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust of the Trust dated as of August 2, 2002, as the same may be amended from time to time (the "Declaration"), including the designation of the terms of the Common Securities as set forth in Annex I to the Declaration. Capitalized terms used herein but not defined shall have the meaning given them in the Declaration. The Holder is entitled to the benefits of the Common Securities Guarantee to the extent provided therein. The Declaration permits the Sponsor to dissolve the Trust at any time. The Sponsor will provide a copy of the Declaration, the Common Securities Guarantee and the Indenture to a Holder without charge upon written request to the Sponsor at its principal place of business.
 
Upon receipt of this certificate, the Sponsor is bound by the Declaration and is entitled to the benefits thereunder.
 
By acceptance, the Holder agrees to treat, for United States federal income tax purposes, the Notes as indebtedness and the Common Securities as evidence of indirect beneficial ownership in the Notes.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Trust has executed this certificate as of August 9, 2002.
 
 
 
This certificate represents the Common Securities referred to in the within-mentioned Declaration.
 
Dated: August            , 2002
 
 
 
 
Distributions payable on each Common Security will be fixed at a rate per annum of 7% (the "Coupon Rate") of the stated liquidation amount of $25 per Common Security, such rate being the rate of interest payable on the Notes to be held by the Property Trustee. Distributions in arrears will continue to accumulate at the same rate compounded quarterly. A Distribution is payable only to the extent that payments are made in respect of the Notes held by the Property Trustee and to the extent the Property Trustee has funds available therefor. The amount of Distributions payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
 
Except as otherwise described below, Distributions on the Common Securities will be cumulative, will accrue from the date of original issuance and will be payable quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on November 15, 2002, to Holders of record 15 days prior to such payment dates, which payment dates shall correspond to the interest payment dates on the Notes. The Note Issuer has the right under the Indenture to defer payments of interest by extending the interest payment period from time to time on the Notes for a period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarterly periods (each an "Extension Period"), no Extension Period shall last beyond the date of the maturity of the Notes. As a consequence of such deferral, Distributions will also be deferred hereunder for the same period. Despite such deferral, quarterly Distributions will continue to accrue with interest thereon (to the extent permitted by applicable law) at the Coupon Rate compounded quarterly during any such Extension Period. Prior to the termination of any such Extension Period, the Note Issuer may further extend such Extension Period; such Extension Period together with all such previous and further extensions thereof may not exceed 20 consecutive quarterly periods or extend beyond the maturity date of the Notes. Payments of accrued Distributions will be payable to Holders as they appear on the books and records of the Trust on the first record date after the end of the Extension Period. Upon the termination of any Extension Period and the payment of all amounts then due, the Note Issuer may commence a new Extension Period, subject to the above requirements.
