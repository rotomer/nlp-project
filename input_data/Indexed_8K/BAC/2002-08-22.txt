Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to local counsel), approved by the Agent in the case of subparagraph (a), representing the indemnified parties under subparagraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii).

policy or otherwise, the Corporation and the Agents shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Corporation and one or more of the Agents may be subject in such proportion so that each Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the total commissions and underwriting discounts received by such Agent bears to the total sales price from the sale of Notes sold to or through the Agents to the date of such liability, and the Corporation is responsible for the balance. However, if the allocation provided by the foregoing sentence is not permitted by applicable law, the Company and the Agents shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Company and one or more of the Agents may be subject in such proportion to reflect the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Agents on the other in connection with the statements or omissions or alleged statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or such Agent, the parties' relative intents, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission, and any other equitable considerations appropriate in the circumstances. The Company and the Agents agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation (even if the Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to above in this paragraph (d). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) in no case shall an Agent be responsible for any amount in excess of the commissions and underwriting discounts received by such Agent in connection with the Notes from which such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses arise and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this , each person who controls any Agent within the meaning of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Agent, and each person who controls the Corporation within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, each officer of the Corporation who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Corporation shall have the same rights to contribution as the Corporation, subject in each case to the provisions of this paragraph (d). Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d).

[EXTENDIBLE NOTE RIDER]
          The Corporation and the purchaser of this Note have agreed that this Note is an Extendible Note, whereby the Corporation has the option to extend the maturity of this Note for one or more whole year periods, as set forth below (each, an "Extension Period"), up to but not beyond the Final Maturity Date set forth below, under the terms of this Note as supplemented by this Extendible Note Rider.
                        Stated Maturity Date:                         Final Maturity Date:  
               The Corporation may exercise its option with respect hereto by delivery to the Trustee (or any duly appointed paying agent) of notice of such exercise at least 45 but not more than 60 days prior to the Stated Maturity Date originally in effect with respect hereto or, if the Stated Maturity Date has already been extended, prior to the maturity date then in effect (each, an "Extended Maturity Date").

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 days prior to the Maturity Date hereof (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the immediately succeeding Business Day), the Corporation, at its option, may revoke the interest rate provided for in the Extension Notice and establish a higher interest rate for the Extension Period by mailing or causing the Trustee (or any duly appointed paying agent) to mail notice of such higher interest rate, first class mail, postage prepaid, to the registered holder hereof. Such notice shall be irrevocable. Thereafter, this Note will bear such higher interest rate for the Extension Period.      
<Page>                                                                                 13
           If the Corporation elects to extend the maturity hereof, the registered holder hereof will have the option to elect repayment hereof by the Corporation on the Maturity Date then in effect at a price equal to the principal amount hereof plus any accrued and unpaid interest to such date. In order for this Note to be so repaid on the Maturity Date, the Corporation must receive, at least 15 days but not more than 30 days prior to the Maturity Date then in effect with respect hereto, (i) this Note with the form "Option to Elect Repayment" on the reverse hereof duly completed or (ii) a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission, or a letter from a member of a national securities exchange, or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States setting forth the name of the registered holder hereof, the principal amount hereof to be repaid, the certificate number, or a description of the tenor and terms hereof, a statement that the option to elect repayment is being exercised thereby, and a guarantee that this Note, together with the duly completed form entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" attached hereto, will be received by the Trustee (or any duly appointed paying agent) not later than the fifth Business Day after the date of such telegram, telex, facsimile transmission, or letter, , , that such telegram, telex, facsimile transmission, or letter shall only be effective if this Note and duly completed form are received by the Trustee (or any duly appointed paying agent) by such fifth Business Day. Such option may be exercised by the registered holder hereof for less than the aggregate principal amount hereof then outstanding, provided that the principal amount hereof remaining outstanding after repayment is an integral multiple of $1,000 unless otherwise stated on the face hereof.    
provided
however

          A "London Banking Day" is any day on which commercial banks are open for business (including dealings in LIBOR currency) in London, England.            The principal of (premium on, if any) and interest on this Note are payable in immediately available funds in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts at the office or agency of the Corporation designated as provided in the Indenture; , , that interest may be paid, at the option of the Corporation, by check mailed to the person entitled thereto at his address last appearing on the registry books of the Corporation relating to the Notes. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, payments of principal of and interest on the Maturity Date will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a designated account maintained in the United States upon (i) receipt of written notice by the Issuing and Paying Agent (as described on the reverse hereof) from the registered holder hereof not less than one           . On each Interest Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will determine LIBOR as follows: If the face of the Note does not specify "LIBOR Telerate" or "LIBOR Reuters," the LIBOR Rate will be LIBOR Telerate. In addition, if the designated LIBOR page by its terms provides only for a single rate, that single rate will be used regardless of the foregoing provisions requiring more than one rate.              The "prime rate" for any Interest Determination Date is the prime rate or base lending rate on that date, as published in H.15(519) by 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on the calculation date for that Interest Determination Date under the heading "Bank Prime Loan."          "Reuters screen US PRIME 1" means the display designated as page "US PRIME 1" on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service (or such other page as may replace the US PRIME 1 page on that service for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major United States banks).          Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate hereon shall not be greater than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or less than the Minimum Interest Rate, if any, specified on the face hereof, and the interest rate on this Note will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law, as the same may be modified by United States law of general application.

        Accrued interest on a Floating Rate Note is calculated by multiplying the principal amount of the Note by an accrued interest factor. The accrued interest factor is the sum of the interest factors calculated for each day in the period for which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor for each day is computed by dividing the interest rate in effect on that day by (1)in the case of a Floating Rate Note based on the treasury rate, the actual number of days in the year or (2) in the case of other Floating Rate Notes, 360. All percentages resulting from any calculation are rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward. For example 9.876545% (or .09876545) will be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655). Dollar amounts used in the calculation are rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward).
       . The "federal funds rate" for any Interest Determination Date is the rate on that date for federal funds, as published in H.15(519) prior to 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the calculation date for that Interest Determination Date under the heading "Federal Funds (Effective)" and/or displayed on Bridge Telerate, Inc. (or any successor service) on page 120 (or any other page as may replace the specified page on that service) ("Telerate Page 120").
Determination of Federal Funds Rate
        The following procedures will be followed if the federal funds rate cannot be determined as described above:
If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the calculation date or does not appear on Telerate Page 120, the federal funds rate will be the rate on that Interest Determination Date, as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source for the purposes of displaying the applicable rate, under the caption "Federal Funds (Effective)."
If the alternate rate described above is not published in H.15 Daily Update by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the calculation date, then the Calculation Agent will determine the federal funds rate to be the average of the rates for the last transaction in overnight federal funds quoted by three leading brokers of federal funds transactions in New York City, selected by the Calculation Agent, as of 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on that Interest Determination Date.
If fewer than three brokers selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as mentioned above, the federal funds rate will be the federal funds rate in effect on that Interest Determination Date.
Determination of LIBOR
<Page>                                                                                9
If "LIBOR Telerate" is specified on the face of this Note, LIBOR will be the rate for deposits in the LIBOR currency having the Index Maturity described on the face of this Note on the applicable Interest Determination Date, as such rate appears on the designated LIBOR page as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on that Interest Determination Date.    
  If "LIBOR Reuters" is described on the face of this Note, LIBOR will be the average of the offered rates for deposits in the LIBOR currency having the Index Maturity described on the face of this Note on the applicable Interest Determination Date, as such rates appear on the designated LIBOR page of 11:00 A.M., London time, on that Interest Determination Date, if at least two such offered rates appear on the designated LIBOR page.
         On any Interest Determination Date on which fewer than the required number of applicable rates appear or no rate appears on the applicable designated LIBOR page, the Calculation Agent will determine LIBOR as follows:
LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the offered rates at which deposits in the LIBOR currency having the Index Maturity described on the face of this Note on the Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in that market at that time are offered by four major banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 A.M., London time, on the Interest Determination Date to prime banks in the London interbank market. The Calculation Agent will select the four banks and request the principal London office of each of those banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR for that Interest Determination Date will be the average of those quotations.
If fewer than two quotations are provided as mentioned above, LIBOR will be the average of the rates quoted by three major banks in the Principal Financial Center selected by the Calculation Agent at approximately 11:00 A.M., in the Principal Financial Center, on the Interest Determination Date for loans to leading European banks in the LIBOR currency having the Index Maturity designated on the face of this Note on the Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time. The Calculation Agent will select the three banks referred to above.
If fewer than three banks selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as mentioned above, LIBOR will remain LIBOR then in effect on the Interest Determination Date.
Determination of Prime Rate.
         The following procedures will be followed if the prime rate cannot be determined as described above:  
<Page>                                                                               10
If the rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the calculation date, then the prime rate will be the rate as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying the applicable rate, under the caption "Bank Prime Loan."
If that rate described above does not appear in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update, or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the calculation date, then the Calculation Agent will determine the prime rate based on the rates as they appear on the Reuters screen US PRIME 1. If at least one rate, but fewer than four rates appear on the Reuters screen US PRIME 1 on the Interest Determination Date, then the prime rate will be the average of the prime rates or base lending rates quoted (on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by a 360-day year) as of the close of business on the Interest Determination Date by four major money center banks in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent.
If fewer than two rates appear on the Reuters screen as US PRIME 1, then the prime rate will be the average of the prime rates furnished in New York City by the appropriate number of substitute banks or trust companies (each organized under the laws of the United States or any of its states and having total equity capital of at least $500,000,000) selected by the Calculation Agent on the Interest Determination Date.
If the banks selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned above, the prime rate will remain the prime rate then in effect on the Interest Determination Date.
           . The "treasury rate" for any Interest Determination Date is the rate set at the auction of direct obligations of the United States ("Treasury bills") having the Index Maturity described on the face of this Note, as published in H.15(519) by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the calculation date for that Interest Determination Date under the heading "U.S. Government Securities'Treasury bills' auction average (investment)" and/or displayed on Bridge Telerate, Inc. (or any successor service) on page 56 (or any other page as may replace that page on that service) ("Telerate Page 56") or page 57 (or any other page as may replace that page on that service) ("Telerate Page 57").
Determination of Treasury Rate
           The following procedures will be followed if the treasury rate cannot be determined as described above:
<page>                                                                11
If the rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, or displayed on Telerate Page 56 or Telerate Page 57 on the calculation date, the treasury rate will be the auction average rate (expressed as a bond equivalent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and applied on a daily basis) as    
  otherwise announced by the United States Department of the Treasury on the calculation date.
If the results of the most recent auction of Treasury bills having the Index Maturity described on the face of this Note are not published or announced as described above by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the calculation date, or if no auction is held on the Interest Determination Date, then the Calculation Agent will determine the treasury rate to be a yield to maturity (expressed as a bond equivalent, on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and applied on a daily basis) of the average of the secondary market bid rates, as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on the Interest Determination Date of three leading primary United States government securities dealers, selected by the Calculation Agent, for the issue of Treasury bills with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity described on the face of this Note.

Such notice shall be irrevocable. Thereafter, this Note will bear such higher interest rate for the Extension Period.  
<Page>                                                                                 18

[RENEWABLE NOTE RIDER]
               The Corporation and the purchaser of this Note have agreed that this Note is a Renewable Note which initially matures on the Stated Maturity Date shown on the face hereof. At each Renewal Date, as specified below, the maturity of this Note will be automatically extended to the corresponding New Maturity Date, as specified below, unless the registered holder of this Note elects to terminate the automatic extension of the maturity of this Note or any portion hereof and delivers a completed Extension Termination Notice to the Trustee (or any duly appointed paying agent) not less than 15 nor more than 30 days prior to the applicable Renewal Date. The Extension Termination Notice may specify all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount of the Note so long as the principal amount of the Note remaining outstanding after repayment is an integral multiple of $1,000 unless otherwise stated on the face hereof. Upon timely delivery of such Extension Termination Notice, the term of the principal amount of this Note subject to such notice will be deemed automatically to mature on the Stated Maturity Date or the then applicable New Maturity Date, as the case may be. The remaining principal balance of such Note, if any, will be deemed to automatically be extended to the corresponding New Maturity Date but in no circumstances may such maturity be extended beyond the Final Maturity Date set forth below. An election to terminate the automatic extension of the maturity hereof shall be irrevocable and binding on each holder hereof. Notwithstanding any such extension, the interest rate applicable to this Note will continue to be calculated as set forth in this Note.

[EXTENDIBLE NOTE RIDER]
              The Corporation and the purchaser of this Note have agreed that this Note is an Extendible Note, whereby the Corporation has the option to extend the maturity of this Note for one or more whole year periods, as set forth below (each, an "Extension Period"), up to but not beyond the Final Maturity Date set forth below, under the terms of this Note as supplemented by this Extendible Note Rider.
                           Stated Maturity Date:                             Final Maturity Date:  
            The Corporation may exercise its option with respect hereto by delivery to the Trustee (or any duly appointed paying agent) of notice of such exercise at least 45 but not more than 60 days prior to the Stated Maturity Date originally in effect with respect hereto or, if the Stated Maturity Date has already been extended, prior to the maturity date then in effect (each, an "Extended Maturity Date"). After such receipt and not later than 40 days prior to the Stated Maturity Date or an Extended Maturity Date, as the case may be (each, a "Maturity Date"), the Trustee (or any duly appointed Paying Agent) will mail first class mail, postage prepaid, to the registered holder hereof a notice (the "Extension Notice") relating to such extension period (the "Extension Period") setting forth (i) the election of the Corporation to extend the maturity hereof, (ii) the new Extended Maturity Date, (iii) the interest rate applicable to the Extension Period, and (iv) the provisions, if any, for redemption during the Extension Period, including the date or dates on which, the period or periods during which and the price or prices at which such redemption may occur during the Extension Period. Upon the mailing by the Trustee (or any duly appointed Paying Agent) of an Extension Notice to the registered holder hereof, the maturity hereof shall be extended automatically as set forth in such Extension Notice, and, except as modified by the Extension Notice and as described in the next paragraph, this Note will have the same terms as prior to the mailing of such Extension Notice.
              Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 days prior to the Maturity Date hereof (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the immediately succeeding Business Day), the Corporation, at its option, may revoke the interest rate provided for in the Extension Notice and establish a higher interest rate for the Extension Period by mailing or causing the Trustee (or any duly appointed paying agent) to mail notice of such higher interest rate, first class mail, postage prepaid, to the registered holder hereof. Such notice shall be irrevocable. Thereafter, this Note will bear such higher interest rate for the Extension Period.
<Page>                                                                                13    
              If the Corporation elects to extend the maturity hereof, the registered holder hereof will have the option to elect repayment hereof by the Corporation on the Maturity Date then in effect at a price equal to the principal amount hereof plus any accrued and unpaid interest to such date. In order for this Note to be so repaid on the Maturity Date, the Corporation must receive, at least 15 days but not more than 30 days prior to the Maturity Date then in effect with respect hereto, (i) this Note with the form "Option to Elect Repayment" on the reverse hereof duly completed or (ii) a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission, or a letter from a member of a national securities exchange, or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States setting forth the name of the registered holder hereof, the principal amount hereof to be repaid, the certificate number, or a description of the tenor and terms hereof, a statement that the option to elect repayment is being exercised thereby, and a guarantee that this Note, together with the duly completed form entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" attached hereto, will be received by the Trustee (or any duly appointed paying agent) not later than the fifth Business Day after the date of such telegram, telex, facsimile transmission, or letter, , , that such telegram, telex, facsimile transmission, or letter shall only be effective if this Note and duly completed form are received by the Trustee (or any duly appointed paying agent) by such fifth Business Day. Such option may be exercised by the registered holder hereof for less than the aggregate principal amount hereof then outstanding, provided that the principal amount hereof remaining outstanding after repayment is an integral multiple of $1,000 unless otherwise stated on the face hereof.

         A "London Banking Day" is any day on which commercial banks are open for business (including dealings in LIBOR currency) in London, England. The principal of (premium on, if any) and interest on this Note are payable in immediately available funds in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts at the office or agency of the Corporation designated as provided in the Indenture; , , that interest may be paid, at the option of the Corporation, by check mailed to the person entitled thereto at his address last appearing on the registry books of the Corporation relating to the Notes. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, payments of principal of and interest on the Maturity Date will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a designated account maintained in the United States upon (i) receipt of written notice by the Issuing and Paying --------------------- (3) This form does not contemplate the offer of Notes to United States Aliens (for United States federal income tax purposes).  If Notes are offered to United States Aliens, the forms of Notes, as used, may be modified to provide for the payment of additional amounts to such United States Aliens or, if applicable, the redemption of such Notes in lieu of payment of such additional amounts.                         . On each Interest Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will determine LIBOR as follows: If the face of the Note does not specify "LIBOR Telerate" or "LIBOR Reuters," the LIBOR Rate will be LIBOR Telerate. In addition, if the designated LIBOR page by its terms provides only for a single rate, that single rate will be used regardless of the foregoing provisions requiring more than one rate.             The "prime rate" for any Interest Determination Date is the prime rate or base lending rate on that date, as published in H.15(519) by 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on the calculation date for that Interest Determination Date under the heading "Bank Prime Loan."               "Reuters screen US PRIME 1" means the display designated as page "US PRIME 1" on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service (or such other page as may replace the US PRIME 1 page on that service for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major United States banks).             Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate hereon shall not be greater than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or less than the Minimum Interest Rate, if any, specified on the face hereof, and the interest rate on this Note will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law, as the same may be modified by United States law of general application.

In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note for the unredeemed portion hereof shall be issued in the name of the registered holder hereof upon the surrender hereof. If this Note is redeemable at the option of the Corporation, the "Redemption Price" shall initially be the Initial Redemption Percentage specified on the face hereof of the principal amount of this Note to be redeemed and shall decline at each anniversary of the Initial Redemption Date by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any, specified on the face hereof of the principal amount to be redeemed until the Redemption Price is 100% of such principal amount.]
IF NO INITIAL REDEMPTION DATE IS SET FORTH ON THE FACE HEREOF, THIS NOTE MAY NOT BE REDEEMED AT THE OPTION OF THE CORPORATION PRIOR TO THE STATED MATURITY DATE.
         The Base Rate (as defined herein) with respect to this Note may be (i) the federal funds rate, (ii) LIBOR, (iii) the prime rate, (iv) the treasury rate or (v) such other rate as is described on the face hereof and on a rider to this Note.
          Except as described below, this Note will bear interest at the rate determined by reference to the appropriate interest rate basis (the "Base Rate") and Index Maturity, each as specified on the face hereof, (i) plus or minus the Spread, if any, specified on the face hereof and/or (ii) multiplied by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof. The interest rate in effect with respect hereto during an Interest Reset Period will be the rate determined on the calculation date by reference to the Interest Determination Date (as hereinafter defined). The interest rate in effect on each day shall be (a) if such day is an Interest Reset Date, as specified on the face hereof, the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date pertaining to such Interest Reset Date or (b) if such day is not an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the immediately preceding Interest Reset Date, that (i) the interest rate in effect from the Original Issue Date to the initial Interest Reset Date shall be the Initial Interest Rate specified on the face hereof, and (ii) the interest rate in effect for the 10 calendar days immediately prior to the Maturity Date shall be the rate in effect on the 10th calendar day preceding such Maturity Date. If any Interest Reset Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that if the Base Rate specified on the face hereof is LIBOR and if such next Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. The term "Final Interest Payment Period" means the period from the final Interest Reset Date to the Maturity Date.

related Interest Reset Date. The Interest Determination Date with respect to any Note that has as its Base Rate the treasury rate will be the day of the week in which the applicable Interest Reset Date falls on which Treasury bills of the Index Maturity specified on the face of this Note normally would be auctioned; , , that if an auction is held on the Friday of the week preceding the Interest Reset Date, the related Interest Determination Date shall be such preceding Friday; and , , that if an auction is held on any Interest Reset Date then the Interest Reset Date shall instead be the first Business Day following such auction.

         Accrued interest on a Floating Rate Note is calculated by multiplying the principal amount of the Note by an accrued interest factor. The accrued interest factor is the sum of the interest factors calculated for each day in the period for which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor for each day is computed by dividing the interest rate in effect on that day by (1)in the case of a Floating Rate Note based on the treasury rate, the actual number of days in the year or (2) in the case of other Floating Rate Notes, 360. All percentages resulting from any calculation are rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward. For example 9.876545% (or .09876545) will be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655). Dollar amounts used in the calculation are rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward).
           . The "federal funds rate" for any Interest Determination Date is the rate on that date for federal funds, as published in H.15(519) prior to 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the calculation date for that Interest Determination Date under the heading "Federal Funds (Effective)" and/or displayed on Bridge Telerate, Inc. (or any successor service) on page 120 (or any other page as may replace the specified page on that service) ("Telerate Page 120").
Determination of Federal Funds Rate
          The following procedures will be followed if the federal funds rate cannot be determined as described above:
 
If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the calculation date or does not appear on Telerate Page 120, the federal funds rate will be the rate on that Interest Determination Date, as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source for the purposes of displaying the applicable rate, under the caption "Federal Funds (Effective)."
If the alternate rate described above is not published in H.15 Daily Update by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the calculation date, then the Calculation Agent will determine the federal funds rate to be the average of the rates for the last transaction in overnight federal funds quoted by three leading brokers of federal funds transactions in New York City, selected by the Calculation Agent, as of 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on that Interest Determination Date.
If fewer than three brokers selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as mentioned above, the federal funds rate will be the federal funds rate in effect on that Interest Determination Date.

Determination of LIBOR
If "LIBOR Telerate" is specified on the face of this Note, LIBOR will be the rate for deposits in the LIBOR currency having the Index Maturity described on the face of this Note on the applicable Interest Determination Date, as such rate appears on the designated LIBOR page as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on that Interest Determination Date.
If "LIBOR Reuters" is described on the face of this Note, LIBOR will be the average of the offered rates for deposits in the LIBOR currency having the Index Maturity described on the face of this Note on the applicable Interest Determination Date, as such rates appear on the designated LIBOR page of 11:00 A.M., London time, on that Interest Determination Date, if at least two such offered rates appear on the designated LIBOR page.
          On any Interest Determination Date on which fewer than the required number of applicable rates appear or no rate appears on the applicable designated LIBOR page, the Calculation Agent will determine LIBOR as follows:
<Page>                                                                 10
LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the offered rates at which deposits in the LIBOR currency having the Index Maturity described on the face of this Note on the Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in that market at that time are offered by four major banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 A.M., London time, on the Interest Determination Date to prime banks in the London interbank market. The Calculation Agent will select the four banks and request the principal London office of each of those banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR for that Interest Determination Date will be the average of those quotations.
If fewer than two quotations are provided as mentioned above, LIBOR will be the average of the rates quoted by three major banks in the Principal Financial Center selected by the Calculation Agent at approximately 11:00 A.M., in the Principal Financial Center, on the Interest Determination Date for loans to leading European banks in the LIBOR currency having the Index Maturity designated on the face of this Note on the Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time. The Calculation Agent will select the three banks referred to above.
If fewer than three banks selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as mentioned above, LIBOR will remain LIBOR then in effect on the Interest Determination Date.  
Determination of Prime Rate.
The following procedures will be followed if the prime rate cannot be determined as described above:
If the rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the calculation date, then the prime rate will be the rate as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying the applicable rate, under the caption "Bank Prime Loan."
If that rate described above does not appear in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update, or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the calculation date, then the Calculation Agent will determine the prime rate based on the rates as they appear on the Reuters screen US PRIME 1. If at least one rate, but fewer than four rates appear on the Reuters screen US PRIME 1 on the Interest Determination Date, then the prime rate will be the average of the prime rates or base lending rates quoted (on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by a 360-day year) as of the close of business on the Interest Determination Date by four major money center banks in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent.
If fewer than two rates appear on the Reuters screen as US PRIME 1, then the prime rate will be the average of the prime rates furnished in New York City by the appropriate number of substitute banks or trust companies (each organized under the laws of the United States or any of its states and having total equity capital of at least $500,000,000) selected by the Calculation Agent on the Interest Determination Date.
If the banks selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned above, the prime rate will remain the prime rate then in effect on the Interest Determination Date.
           . The "treasury rate" for any Interest Determination Date is the rate set at the auction of direct obligations of the United States ("Treasury bills") having the Index Maturity described on the face of this Note, as published in H.15(519) by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the calculation date for that Interest Determination Date under the heading "U.S. Government Securities'Treasury bills' auction average (investment)" and/or displayed on Bridge Telerate, Inc. (or any successor service) on page 56 (or any other page as may replace that page on that service) ("Telerate Page 56") or page 57 (or any other page as may replace that page on that service) ("Telerate Page 57").  
Determination of Treasury Rate

           The following procedures will be followed if the treasury rate cannot be determined as described above:
If the rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, or displayed on Telerate Page 56 or Telerate Page 57 on the calculation date, the treasury rate will be the auction average rate (expressed as a bond equivalent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and applied on a daily basis) as otherwise announced by the United States Department of the Treasury on the calculation date.
If the results of the most recent auction of Treasury bills having the Index Maturity described on the face of this Note are not published or announced as described above by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the calculation date, or if no auction is held on the Interest Determination Date, then the Calculation Agent will determine the treasury rate to be a yield to maturity (expressed as a bond equivalent, on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and applied on a daily basis) of the average of the secondary market bid rates, as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on the Interest Determination Date of three leading primary United States government securities dealers, selected by the Calculation Agent, for the issue of Treasury bills with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity described on the face of this Note.
If fewer than three dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as mentioned above, the treasury rate will remain the treasury rate then in effect on that Interest Determination Date.
          The Calculation Agent shall calculate the interest rate hereon in accordance with the foregoing on or before each calculation date. At the request of the registered holder hereof, the Calculation Agent will provide to such holder hereof the interest rate hereon then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate which will become effective as of the next Interest Reset Date.
           The provisions of Article Fourteen of the Indenture do not apply to Securities of this Series.
          If an Event of Default (defined in the Indenture as certain events involving the bankruptcy of the Corporation) shall occur with respect to the Notes, the principal of all the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. THERE IS NO RIGHT OF ACCELERATION PROVIDED IN THE INDENTURE IN CASE OF A DEFAULT IN THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST OR THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY OTHER COVENANT BY THE CORPORATION.

          The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Corporation and the rights of the holders of the Notes under the Indenture at any time by the Corporation with the consent of the holders of not less than 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and all other Securities then outstanding under the Indenture and affected by such amendment and modification. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and all other Securities then outstanding under the Indenture and affected thereby, on behalf of the holders of all such Securities, to waive compliance by the Corporation with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
          No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Corporation, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
          No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of (premium on, if any) or the interest on this Note, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer, or director, as such, past, present, or future, of the Corporation or any predecessor or successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for issue hereof, expressly waived and released.

<Page>                                                                      13

Ladies and Gentlemen:
               We have acted as counsel to Bank of America Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3, Registration No. 333-97197 (the "Registration Statement"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and (ii) the Debt Prospectus dated August 20, 2002 constituting a part thereof, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement dated August 20, 2002 (as so supplemented, the "Prospectus"), relating to the issuance and sale from time to time by the Corporation of up to an aggregate of $5,000,000,000 principal amount of its Senior Medium-Term Notes, Series J, and its Subordinated Medium-Term Notes, Series J (collectively referred to as the "Medium-Term Notes"). The Medium-Term Notes are to be issued, separately or together, and are to be sold from time to time as set forth in the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto.
               As such counsel, we have examined and are familiar with such original or photocopies or certified copies of such records of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, certificates of officers of the Corporation and its subsidiaries and of public officials and such other documents as we have deemed relevant or necessary as the basis for the opinions set forth below. In such examinations, we have assumed the legal capacity of natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures on, and the authenticity of, all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as photocopies thereof and the authenticity of the originals of such copies. We have also relied upon statements of fact contained in documents that we have examined in connection with our representation of the Corporation.
                Based solely upon the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, and subject to the limitations, qualifications and exceptions set forth below, we are of the opinion that the Medium-Term Notes have been duly authorized and, when the terms of the Medium-Term Notes have been established and when the Medium-Term Notes have been completed, executed, authenticated and delivered in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture dated January 1, 1995 between the Registrant (successor to NationsBank Corporation ("NationsBank")) and The Bank of New York (successor in interest to U.S. Bank Trust National Association, as successor trustee to BankAmerica National Trust Company), as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 18, 1998 and a Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 7, 2001, or the Indenture dated January 1, 1995 between the Registrant (successor to NationsBank) and The Bank of New York, as trustee, as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of August 28, 1998, the Board Resolution (as defined in the respective Indentures) dated August 20, 2002, and the Distribution Agreement among the Corporation and the Agents named in Exhibit A thereto, against payment of the consideration therefor, will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Corporation subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors now or hereafter in effect, and to equitable principles that may limit the right to specific enforcement of remedies, and further subject to 12 U.S.C.  1818(b)(6)(D) (or any successor statute) and any bank regulatory powers now or hereafter in effect and to the application of principles of public policy.
            We hereby consent to be named in the Registration Statement as attorneys who passed upon the legality of the Medium-Term Notes and to the filing of a copy of this opinion as part of the Corporation's Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed for the purpose of including this opinion as part of the Registration Statement.
                                                                                   Very truly yours,
