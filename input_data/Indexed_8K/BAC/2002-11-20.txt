Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:
        Bank of America Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), hereby confirms its agreement with Banc of America Securities LLC, Fleet Securities, Inc., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Wachovia Securities, Inc., each as its agent (each, a "Placement Agent," and collectively, the "Placement Agents"), with respect to the issuance and sale by the Company of, and the solicitation by the Placement Agents on behalf of the Company of offers to purchase, $145,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 3.761% Senior Notes, due 2007 (the "Securities") to Core Investment Grade Bond Trust I (the "Trust"). The Securities will be issued under an indenture dated as of January 1, 1995 between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 18, 1998 and the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 7, 2001 (as so supplemented, the "Indenture"). The Securities are described more fully in the Final Prospectus, referred to below. The Company will issue and sell the Securities to the Trust and simultaneously therewith, Core Bond Products LLC, as depositor of the Trust (the "Depositor"), will offer and sell pass-through certificates of the Trust ("Pass-Through Certificates") through the Placement Agents to investors.
        The Company hereby confirms as follows its agreements with the Placement Agents.
         1.     . The Company hereby appoints the Placement Agents as its exclusive agents in connection with the solicitation of offers to purchase the Securities from the Company by the Trust and the simultaneous issuance and sale by the Trust of the Pass-Through Certificates to investors, and each of the Placement Agents accepts such appointment. The Company shall not appoint any other entity or person to act on its behalf, or to assist it, in the placement of the Securities.

         2.     . On the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company herein contained and subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Placement Agents agrees to use its  
Solicitations of Offers by the Placement Agents

reasonable efforts to solicit offers from the Trust for the purchase of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities specified opposite its name in Schedule I attached hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties hereto agree that no Placement Agent shall be obligated, under any circumstance, to purchase Securities from the Company, as principal or otherwise.
         3.     .
Delivery and Payment
                  (a)       Each Placement Agent will communicate to the Company orally each offer for the purchase of Securities. If a Placement Agent orally communicates to the Company that it has received an offer for the purchase of Securities at a price at least equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, then the Company shall accept such offer in whole, provided that the aggregate of all offers does not exceed $145,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Securities. If the Company shall default on its obligation to deliver Securities to a purchaser whose offer has been solicited by a Placement Agent on an agency basis and accepted by the Company or fails to satisfy any condition to its issuance and sale of the Securities hereunder, the Company shall (1) hold such Placement Agent harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from, or as a result of, such default or failure and (2) pay to such Placement Agent the commission to which it would otherwise be entitled absent such default or failure.
                 (b)      The Company hereby agrees to pay to each Placement Agent a commission equal to 0.30% of the principal amount of each Security to be delivered to an investor whose offer has been solicited by such Placement Agent on an agency basis and has been accepted, or is required to be accepted in accordance with the terms hereof, by the Company. Such commission shall be payable in the form of a discount from the price received from purchasers of Securities.
                 (c)      Delivery of Securities sold through a Placement Agent as an agent of the Company shall be made by the Company to such Placement Agent for the account of the purchaser thereof only against payment therefor in immediately available funds. If the purchaser of the Securities fails to accept delivery of the Securities or fails to make payment in full therefor by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on November 20, 2002 or at such other time on such other date as may be agreed upon by the Company and the Placement Agents (such date is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date"), the applicable Placement Agent shall promptly notify the Company and return such Securities to the Company. If such Placement Agent has theretofore advanced funds on behalf of a purchaser, the Company shall promptly return the related funds to such Placement Agent and shall reimburse such Placement Agent on an equitable basis for its loss of the use of funds for the period such funds were credited to the Company's account.
           4.    .

number of which is set forth in Schedule I hereto), which has become effective, for the registration under the Act of the Securities. Such registration statement, as amended at the date of this Agreement, meets the requirements set forth in Rule 415(a)(1) under the Act and complies in all other material respects with said Rule. The Company proposes to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) or Rule 434 under the Act a supplement to the form of prospectus included in such registration statement relating to the Securities and the plan of distribution thereof and has previously advised you of all further information (financial and other) with respect to the Company to be set forth therein.

<Page>                                                                        3
omitted from the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by any Placement Agent specifically for use in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and any Final Prospectus.

The Commission has not issued any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any order preventing or suspending the use of the Final Prospectus and the Company is without knowledge that any proceedings have been instituted for either purpose.
                   (b)      Each Placement Agent, severally and not jointly, represents and agrees that:
                              (i)      It has not and will not, directly or indirectly, offer, sell or deliver any of the Securities or distribute the Final Prospectus or any other offering materials relating to the Securities in or from any jurisdiction except under circumstances that will, to the best of its knowledge and belief, result in compliance with any applicable laws and regulations thereof and that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, will not impose any obligations on the Company except as set forth herein.
                              (ii)      In particular, (A) it has not offered or sold and will not offer or sell any Securities to persons in the United Kingdom prior to the expiration of the period six months from the Closing Date, except to persons whose ordinary activities involve them in acquiring, holding, managing or disposing of investments (whether as principal or agent) for the purpose of their businesses or otherwise in circumstances which have not resulted and will not result in an offer to the public in the United Kingdom within the meaning of the Public Offers of Securities Regulation 1995, (B) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the "FSMA") with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Securities in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom, and (C) it will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the Securities in circumstances in which Section 21(l) of the FSMA does not apply to the Company.
               5.      . The Company agrees with each Placement Agent that:
Agreements
                       (a)      Prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities, the Company will not file any amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement to the Basic Prospectus  
<Page>                                                                       4  
(including the Final Prospectus) unless the Company has furnished you a copy for your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Company will cause the Final Prospectus to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 or Rule 434 via EDGAR. The Company will advise the Placement Agents promptly (i) when the Final Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 or Rule 434, (ii) when any amendment to the Registration Statement relating to the Securities shall have become effective, (iii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or amendment of or supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.
                   (b)      If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act, except with respect to any such delivery requirement imposed upon an affiliate of the Company in connection with any secondary market sales, any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules and regulations thereunder, the Company promptly will prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the first sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment or supplement which will effect such compliance.

The Company will pay the expenses of printing all documents relating to the offering.
                 (e)       The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Placement Agents may reasonably designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will arrange for the determination of the legality of the Securities for purchase by institutional

         In rendering such opinion, but without opining in connection therewith, such counsel also shall state that, although it expresses no view as to portions of the Registration Statement consisting of financial statements and other financial, accounting and statistical information and it has not independently verified, is not passing upon and assumes no responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (other than as stated in (iv) above), it has no reason to believe that such remaining portions of the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto at the time it became effective and as of the date of such opinion contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that, subject to the foregoing with respect to financial statements and other financial, accounting and statistical information, the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, as of its date and as of the date of such opinion contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a  
<Page>                                                                               8
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
         In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of North Carolina, the United States, or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware to the extent deemed proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of counsel to the Placement Agents, or upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing believed to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Placement Agents; and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent deemed proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and its subsidiaries and public officials.
                    (c)      The Placement Agents shall have received from Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP, counsel for the Placement Agents, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Indenture, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus and any other related matters as the Placement Agents may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
                    (d)     The Company shall have furnished to the Placement Agents a certificate of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer or a Senior Vice President, and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus and this Agreement and they are without knowledge that:
                             (i)     the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are not true and correct with the same force and effect as though expressly made at and as of the Closing Date and the Company has not performed or complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to the Closing Date;
                             (ii)     any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued or any proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened by the Commission; and
                             (iii)     since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Final Prospectus, there has been any material adverse change or any development involving a prospective material adverse change in the condition (financial or other), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus.
                   (e)     At the Closing Date, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Placement Agents a letter or letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to one or more of the Placement Agents), dated as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Placement Agents, confirming that the response, if any, to Item 10 of the Registration Statement is correct insofar as it relates to them and stating in effect that:
                            (i)      They are independent accountants within the meaning of the Act  
<Page>                                                                   9
and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable published rules and regulations thereunder.
                            (ii)     In their opinion, the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries audited by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder with respect to registration statements on Form S-3 and the Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder.
                            (iii)     On the basis of procedures (but not an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) consisting of:
                            (a)      Reading the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, the board of directors, executive committee and audit committee of the Company and the boards of directors and executive committees of its subsidiaries as set forth in the minute books through a specified date not more than five business days prior to the date of delivery of such letter;
                           (b)      Performing the procedures specified by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for a review of interim financial information as described in Statement of Accounting Standards No. 71, Interim Financial Information, on the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus and reading the unaudited interim financial data, if any, for the period from the date of the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus to the date of the latest available interim financial data; and
                           (c)       Making inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters regarding the specific items for which representations are requested below;
nothing has come to their attention as a result of the foregoing procedures that caused them to believe that:
<Page>                                                                               10
          (1)       the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus, do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act and the published rules and regulations thereunder;
          (2)        any material modifications should be made to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus, for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles;
          (3)        (i) at the date of the latest available interim financial data    
  and at the specified date not more than five business days prior to the date of the delivery of such letter, there was any change in the capital stock or the long-term debt (other than scheduled repayments of such debt) or any decreases in shareholders' equity of the Company and the subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as compared with the amounts shown in the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or (ii) for the period from the date of the latest available financial data to a specified date not more than five business days prior to the delivery of such letter, there was any change in the capital stock or the long-term debt (other than scheduled repayments of such debt) or any decreases in shareholders' equity of the Company and the subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, except in all instances for changes or decreases which the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur, or PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall state any specific changes or decreases.
         In addition, at the time this Agreement is executed, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Placement Agents a letter or letters, dated the date of this Agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to them, to the effect set forth in this paragraph (e) and in Schedule I hereto.
                    (f)       Subsequent to the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (e) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or other), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the judgment of the Placement Agents, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus.
                   (g)      Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Placement Agents such further information, certificates and documents as the Placement Agents may reasonably request.
                    (h)     On or after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating  
<Page>                                                                  11
of any of the Company's debt securities.
                    (i)     There shall not have come to the Placement Agents' attention any facts that would cause the Placement Agents to believe that the Final Prospectus, at the time it was required to be delivered to a purchaser of the Securities, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances existing at the time of such delivery, not misleading.
          If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Placement Agents and their counsel, this Agreement and all obligations of the Placement Agents hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Placement Agents. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or telegraph confirmed in writing.
          7.       . The Company and the Placement Agents agree as follows:
Agreements regarding the Pass-Through Certificates
                    (a)      The Company authorizes and directs the Placement Agents to deliver a copy of the Final Prospectus to each purchaser of Pass-Through Certificates. Each of the Company and the Placement Agents (1) acknowledges that The Bank of New York in its capacity as trustee for the Trust has assigned to purchasers of the Pass-Through Certificates and subsequent holders of the Pass-Through Certificates its rights against the Company and such Placement Agents under federal and state securities laws with respect to the Trust's purchase of the Securities, and (2) agrees not to contest the enforceability of this assignment.
                   (b)      The Placement Agents acknowledge that: (1) the Company has no obligations relating to, or other role in connection with, the Trust or the Pass-Through Certificates; (2) the Company has no obligation to take into account the needs of, or interests of, the beneficial owners of the Pass-Through Certificates; (3) the Company has not participated in the preparation of, nor has it reviewed, any offering materials relating to the Pass-Through Certificates; and (4) the Company is not responsible for the public disclosure of information by the Trust relating to the Pass-Through Certificates.

<Page>                                                                          12
Placement Agents of copies of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto and of the Final Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto, (viii) the printing and delivery to the Placement Agents of copies of any Blue Sky Survey, and (ix) the fees of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., (x) the preparation, printing, reproduction and delivery to the Placement Agents of copies of the Indentures and all supplements and amendments thereto, (xi) any fees charged by rating agencies for the rating of the Securities, and (xii) the fees and expenses of any depository and any nominee thereof in connection with the Securities.
           If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Placement Agents set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Placement Agents, the Company will reimburse the Placement Agents severally upon demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
          9.     .
Indemnification and Contribution
                   (a)      The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Placement Agent and each person who controls any Placement Agent within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or arise out of or are based upon omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Final Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that (i) the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Placement Agent specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arises out of or is based upon statements in or omissions from that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification of the Trustee (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee, and (ii) such indemnity with respect to the Basic Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Placement Agent (or any person controlling such Placement Agent) from whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the  
<Page>                                                                          13
Securities which are the subject thereof if such person did not receive a copy of the Final Prospectus (or the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented) excluding documents incorporated therein by reference at or prior to the confirmation of the sale of such Securities to such person in any case where such delivery is required by the Act and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in the Basic Prospectus or any preliminary Final Prospectus was corrected in the Final Prospectus (or the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
                           (b)     Each Placement Agent severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Placement Agent, but only with reference to written information relating to such Placement Agent furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Placement Agent specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereof. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Placement Agent may otherwise have.
                          (c)      Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 9 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 9, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 9. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 9 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to local counsel), approved by the Placement Agents in the case of subparagraph (a), representing the indemnified parties under subparagraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the  
<Page>                                                                            14
indemnifying party; and except that if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii).
                             (d)       To provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) of this Section 9 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Company on the grounds of policy or otherwise, the Company and the Placement Agents shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Company and one or more of the Placement Agents may be subject in such proportion so that the Placement Agents are responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the agency fee bears to the sum of such fee and the purchase price of the Securities specified in Schedule I hereto and the Company is responsible for the balance; provided, however, that (y) in no case shall any Placement Agent (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the fee applicable to the Securities received by such Placement Agent hereunder and (z) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 9, each person who controls a Placement Agent within the meaning of the Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Placement Agent, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to clause (y) of this paragraph (d). Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d).
               10.      . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Placement Agents, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, or (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in the commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or material escalation of hostilities or other calamity or crisis (in the United States or elsewhere) the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Placement Agents, impracticable to market the Securities.
Termination
               11.      . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Placement Agents set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Placement Agent or the

BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION
               BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (herein called the "Corporation," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum of ONE HUNDRED FORTY-FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND 00/100 on November 30, 2007 and to pay interest on said principal sum, semi-annually in arrears on May 30 and November 30 of each year, commencing May 30, 2003, at the rate of 3.761% per annum, from the May 30 or November 30, as the case may be, next preceding the date this Note to which interest has been paid, unless the date hereof is a date to which interest has been paid, in which case from the date of this Note, or unless no interest has been paid on the Notes, in which case from November 20, 2002, until payment of such principal sum has been made or duly provided for. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the date hereof is after a record date for the Notes, (which shall be the close of business on the last day of the calendar month next preceding an interest payment date) and before the next succeeding interest payment date, this Note shall bear interest from such interest payment date; provided, however, that if the Corporation shall default in the payment of interest due on such interest payment date, then this Note shall bear interest from the next preceding interest payment date to which interest has been paid, or, if no interest has been paid on the Notes, from November 20, 2002. Interest on this Note will accrue from the original issue date specified above until the principal amount is paid and will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. Interest payments will equal the amount of interest accrued from, and including, the preceding interest payment date in respect of which interest has been paid or duly provided for (or from, and including, the original issue date specified above, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for) to, but excluding, the interest payment date or the maturity date, as the case may be. If the maturity date or an  
<Page>
interest payment date falls on a day which is not a Business Day as defined below, principal of or interest payable with respect to such maturity date or interest payment date will be paid on the succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such maturity date or interest payment date, as the case may be. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any interest payment date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes evidencing all or a portion of the same debt as this Note) is registered at the close of business on the record date for such interest payment date.
          The principal of and interest on this Note are payable in immediately available funds in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts, at the office or agency of the Corporation in New York, New York or such other places that the Corporation shall designate as provided in such Indenture; provided, however, that interest may be paid, at the option of the Corporation, by check mailed to the person entitled thereto at his address last appearing on the registry books of the Corporation relating to the Notes. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, payments of principal of and interest payable on the maturity date will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a designated account maintained in the United States upon (i) receipt of written notice by the Issuing and Paying Agent (as described on the reverse hereof) from the registered holder hereof not less than one Business Day prior to the due date of such principal and (ii) presentation of this Note to the Issuing and Paying Agent, at the Bank of New York, 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286. Any interest not punctually paid or duly provided for shall be payable as provided in such Indenture. As used herein, "Business Day" means any weekday that is not a legal holiday in New York, New York or Charlotte, North Carolina and is not a day on which banking institutions in those cities are authorized or required by law or regulation to be closed.
       Reference is made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof, which shall have the same effect as though fully set forth at this place.
       Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee or by an authenticating agent on behalf of the Trustee by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under such Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Instrument to be duly executed, by manual or facsimile signature, under its corporate seal or a facsimile thereof.

[Reverse of Note]
3.761% SENIOR NOTE, DUE 2007
BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION
          This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Securities of the Corporation unlimited in aggregate principal amount issued and to be issued under an Indenture dated as of January 1, 1995 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Corporation (successor to NationsBank Corporation) and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (successor in interest to U.S. Bank Trust National Association, as successor trustee to BankAmerica National Trust Company, herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 18, 1998 and a Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 7, 2001, to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights thereunder of the Corporation, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes, and the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The series of which this Note is a part also is designated as the Corporation's 3.761% Senior Notes, due 2007 (herein called the "Notes"), initially in the principal amount of $145,000,000. The amount of Notes of this series may be increased by the Corporation in the future. The Trustee initially shall act as Security Registrar and Authenticating and Issuing and Paying Agent in connection with the Notes.
        This Note is not subject to any sinking fund.
        The provisions of Article Fourteen of the Indenture do not apply to Securities of this Series.
        The Notes of this series may be redeemed at the option of the Corporation in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, on giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice to the Trustee and the holders of the Notes.
        Notes so redeemed will be redeemed at the "Make-Whole Price."
        The term "Make-whole Price" means for the Note as of any redemption date an amount equal to the greater of:
 
100% of the principal amount of the Note; or
the amount determined by the designated dealer to be the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Note (not including any portion of payments of interest accrued as of the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate;
        In such determination, the terms used shall have the following meanings:  
<Page>                                                                  3  
      "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date plus 12.5 basis points.
      "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the designated dealer as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Notes.
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date: (1) the average of three or more available Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such date (which must include quotations from those placement agents that are, or whose successors are, Reference Treasury Dealers at such date), after excluding the highest and the lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if fewer than three such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations are obtained, the average of all such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means any entity that is a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. on the third Business Day preceding such redemption date.
     The Trustee will select one of the placement agents as the designated dealer to determine the Make-whole Price. Absent manifest error, all of that entity's determinations will be binding on the placement agents as well as the Corporation without any liability on the part of the designated dealer.
     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Security Register or registry books of the Corporation relating to the Notes, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Corporation designated by it pursuant to the Indenture, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Corporation and the Trustee or the Security Registrar duly executed by the registered holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
    No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Corporation may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
     Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note, the Corporation, the Trustee, the Issuing and Paying Agent, and any agent of the Corporation may treat the person in  
<Page>                                                                          5

       The Notes are issuable only as registered Notes without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture, and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations, as requested by the holder surrendering the same.
      If an Event of Default (defined in the Indenture as (i) the Corporation's failure to pay the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Notes when due, or to pay interest on the Notes within 30 days after the same becomes due, (ii) the Corporation's breach of its other covenants contained in this Note or in the Indenture, which breach is not cured within 90 days after written notice by the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in outstanding principal amount of all Securities issued under the Indenture and affected thereby, and (iii) certain events involving the bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation of the Corporation) shall occur with respect to the Notes, the principal of all the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
      The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Corporation and the rights of the holders of the Notes under the Indenture at any time by the Corporation with the consent of the holders of not less than 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and all other Securities then outstanding under the Indenture and affected by such amendment and modification. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and all other Securities then outstanding under the Indenture and affected thereby, on behalf of the holders of all such Securities, to waive compliance by the Corporation with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Corporation, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place, and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
     No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Note, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer, or director, as such, past, present, or future, of the Corporation or any predecessor or successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute, or rule of law, or by the enforcement
<Page>                                                                       6
of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for issue hereof, expressly waived and released.
        The Notes of this series shall be dated the date of their authentication.
        All terms used in this Note which are not defined herein, but are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

The Corporation will recognize Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC, while the registered holder of the Notes, as the owner of the Notes for all purposes, including payment of principal (premium, if any) and interest, notices, and voting. Transfer of principal (premium, if any) and interest to participants of DTC will be the responsibility of DTC, and transfer of principal (premium, if any) and interest to beneficial owners of the Notes by participants of DTC will be the responsibility of such participants and other nominees of such beneficial owners.

       In such determination, the terms used shall have the following meanings:
       "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date plus 12.5 basis points.

       The Trustee will select one of the Placement Agents as the designated dealer to determine the Make-whole Price. Absent manifest error, all of that entity's determinations will be binding on the Placement Agents as well as the Corporation without any liability on the part of the designated dealer.
      RESOLVED FURTHER, that any Authorized Officer is hereby authorized and empowered to take all steps deemed necessary by such officer to issue and sell the initial series of the Senior Notes, and to adjust the amount of issued and outstanding Senior Notes of this series up to the maximum amount authorized and unissued under the Shelf, such actions to include delivery of appropriate Officers Certificates and Company Orders; the execution and delivery of additional Senior Notes; the selection of one or more placement agents and the negotiation, execution and delivery of an appropriate Placement Agency Agreement; the preparation of a global prospectus supplement, as well as any amendments or supplements to such global prospectus supplement for the Senior Notes; and the execution and delivery of necessary closing documents; and

            Re: Public Offering of $145,000,000 Aggregate Principal Amount of 3.761% Senior Notes, due 2007
Ladies and Gentlemen:
           We have acted as counsel to Bank of America Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), in connection with (i) the issuance of $145,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of its 3.761% Senior Notes, due 2007 (the "Notes") and (ii) the Registration Statement on Form S-3, Registration No. 333-97197 (the "Registration Statement"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), with respect to $20,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Corporation's unsecured debt securities, units, warrants, shares of its preferred stock and shares of its common stock and the Prospectus dated August 20, 2002 constituting a part thereof, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement dated November 15, 2002 filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act, relating to the Notes.
          As such counsel, we have examined and are familiar with such original or photocopies or certified copies of such records of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, certificates of officers of the Corporation and of public officials and such other documents as we have deemed relevant or necessary as the basis for the opinion set forth below. In such examinations, we have assumed the legal capacity of natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures on, and the authenticity of, all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified copies or photocopies and the authenticity of the originals of such copies. We have also relied upon statements of fact contained in documents that we have examined in connection with our representation of the Corporation.
            Based solely upon the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, and subject to the limitations, qualifications and exceptions set forth below, we are of the opinion that the Notes, when (i) executed, issued and delivered by the Corporation to The Bank of New York for authentication in accordance with the Indenture dated as of January 1, 1995, as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 18, 1998 and the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 7, 2001 (the "Indenture") between the Corporation and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee"), (ii) authenticated and delivered by The Bank of New York, as issuing  
<Page>
and paying agent, in accordance with the Indenture and (iii) paid for, all as contemplated in the Board Resolution or Company Order (as each is defined in the Indenture), will have been validly authorized and issued under the Indenture and will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Corporation subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors now or hereafter in effect, and to equitable principles that may limit the right to specific performance of remedies, and further subject to 12 U.S.C. Section 1818(b)(6)(D) (or any successor statute) and any bank regulatory powers now or hereafter in effect and to the application of principles of public policy.
        We hereby consent to be named in the Registration Statement as attorneys who passed upon the legality of the Notes and to the filing of a copy of this opinion as part of the Corporation's Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed for the purpose of including this opinion as part of the Registration Statement.
                                                                                  Very truly yours,
                                                                                    /S/ HELMS MULLISS & WICKER, PLLC
