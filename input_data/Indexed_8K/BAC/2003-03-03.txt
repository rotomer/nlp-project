UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT (3 5/8% Senior Notes, due 2008)
New York, New York February 20, 2003
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:
     Bank of America Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to sell to the underwriters named in Schedule II hereto (the "Underwriters"), for whom you are acting as representatives (the "Representatives"), the principal amount of its securities identified in Schedule I hereto (the "Securities"). The Securities will be issued under an indenture dated as of January 1, 1995 between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 18, 1998 and the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 7, 2001 (as so supplemented, the "Indenture"). The Securities are described more fully in the Final Prospectus, referred to below. If the firm or firms listed in Schedule II hereto include only the firm or firms listed in Schedule I hereto, then the terms "Underwriters" and "Representatives", as used herein, each shall be deemed to refer to such firm or firms.
        1.     .
Representations and Warranties
                (a)  The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each Underwriter that:
                       (i)   The Company meets the requirements for use of Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on such form (the file number of which is set forth in Schedule I hereto), which has become effective, for the registration under the Act of the Securities. Such registration statement, as amended at the date of this Agreement, meets the requirements set forth in Rule 415(a)(1) under the Act and complies in all other material respects with said Rule. The Company proposes to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) or Rule 434 under the Act a supplement to the form of prospectus included in such registration statement relating to the Securities and the plan of distribution thereof and has previously advised you of all further information (financial and other) with respect to the Company to be set forth therein. Such registration statement, including the exhibits thereto, as amended at the date of this Agreement, is hereinafter called the "Registration Statement"; such prospectus in the form in which it appears in the Registration Statement is hereinafter called the "Basic Prospectus"; and such supplemented form of  
<Page
prospectus, including the final prospectus in preliminary form, in the form in which it shall be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) or Rule 434 (including the Basic Prospectus as so supplemented) is hereinafter called the "Final Prospectus." Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), on or before the date of this Agreement, or the issue date of the Basic Prospectus, or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference herein to the terms "amend", "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the date of this Agreement, or the issue date of the Basic Prospectus, or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be, and deemed to be incorporated therein by reference. The Final Prospectus, if filed by electronic transmission pursuant to the Commission's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR") (except as may be permitted by Regulation S-T under the Act), was identical to the copy thereof delivered to the Underwriters for use in connection with the offer and sale of the Securities.
                       (ii)   As of the date hereof, when the Final Prospectus is first filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) or Rule 434 under the Act, when any supplement or amendment to the Final Prospectus is filed with the Commission, at the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) and, with respect to (i) and (ii) below, when the Registration Statement became effective, (i) the Registration Statement, as amended as of any such time, and the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of any such time, and the Indenture will comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"), and the Exchange Act and the respective rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, (ii) the Registration Statement, as amended as of any such time, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, and (iii) the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of any such time, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that the Company makes no representations or warranties as to (A) that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification of the Trustee (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee or (B) the information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and any Final Prospectus. If Rule 434 is used, the Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 434 applicable to it. The documents which are incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus or from which information is so incorporated by reference, when they were filed with the Commission, complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Act, the Exchange Act and the respective rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, as applicable, and did not, when such documents were so filed, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact  
<Page                                                                      2
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and any documents so filed and incorporated by reference subsequent to the effective date of the Registration Statement, when they were filed with the Commission, conformed in all material respects with the requirements of the Act, the Exchange Act and the respective rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, as applicable. The Commission has not issued any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any order preventing or suspending the use of the Final Prospectus and the Company is without knowledge that any proceedings have been instituted for either purpose.
                   (b)   Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, represents and agrees that:
                           (i)    it has not and will not, directly or indirectly, offer, sell or deliver any of the Securities or distribute the Final Prospectus or any other offering materials relating to the Securities in or from any jurisdiction except under circumstances that will result in compliance with any applicable laws and regulations thereof and that will not impose any obligations on the Company except as set forth herein;
                           (ii)  it will comply with the selling restrictions set forth on Schedule III attached hereto.
         2.     . Subject to the terms and conditions and in reliance upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, the Company agrees to sell to each Underwriter, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, at the purchase price set forth in Schedule I hereto, the principal amount of the Securities set forth opposite such Underwriter's name in Schedule II hereto.
Purchase and Sale
         3.    . Delivery of and payment for the Securities shall be made on the date and at the time specified in Schedule I hereto, which date and time may be postponed by agreement between the Representatives and the Company or as provided in Section 8 hereto (such date and time of delivery and payment for the Securities being herein called the "Closing Date"). Delivery of the Securities shall be made to the Representatives for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters against payment by the several Underwriters through the Representatives of the purchase price thereof in the manner set forth in Schedule I hereto. Unless otherwise agreed, certificates for the Securities shall be in the form set forth in Schedule I hereto, and such certificates may be deposited with The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") or a custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC.
Delivery and Payment
        4.    . The Company agrees with the several Underwriters that:
Agreements
               (a)   Prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities, the Company will not file any amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement to the Basic Prospectus (including the Final Prospectus) unless the Company has furnished you a copy for your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Company will cause the Final Prospectus to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 or Rule 434 via EDGAR. The  
<Page                                                                           3
Company will advise the Representatives promptly (i) when the Final Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 or Rule 434, (ii) when any amendment to the Registration Statement relating to the Securities shall have become effective, (iii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or amendment of or supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.
               (b)   If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act, except with respect to any such delivery requirement imposed upon an affiliate of the Company in connection with any secondary market sales, any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules and regulations thereunder, the Company promptly will prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the first sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 4, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment or supplement which will effect such compliance.
              (c)   The Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representatives as soon as practicable, but not later than 60 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement (in form complying with the provisions of Rule 158 under the Act) covering a twelve-month period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the "effective date" (as defined in said Rule 158) of the Registration Statement.
              (d)   The Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and each amendment thereto which shall become effective on or prior to the Closing Date and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act, as many copies of any Final Prospectus and any amendments thereof and supplements thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request. The Company will pay the expenses of printing all documents relating to the offering.
              (e)   The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may reasonably designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will arrange for the determination of the legality of the Securities for purchase by institutional investors; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general or unlimited service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.  
<Page                                                                       4  
             (f)   Until the business day following the Closing Date, the Company will not, without the consent of the Representatives, offer or sell, or announce the offering of, any securities covered by the Registration Statement or by any other registration statement filed under the Act; provided, however, the Company may, at any time, offer or sell or announce the offering of any securities (A) covered by a registration statement on Form S-8 or (B) covered by a registration statement on Form S-3 and (i) pursuant to which the Company issues securities under one of the Company's medium-term note programs (including, without limitation, the Company's InterNotes program) or (ii) pursuant to which the Company issues securities for its dividend reinvestment plan.
       5.   . The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company contained herein as of the date hereof, as of the date of the effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement filed prior to the Closing Date (including the filing of any document incorporated by reference therein) and as of the Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company made in any certificates furnished pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:

                           (ii)  In their opinion, the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries audited by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder with respect to registration statements on Form S-3 and the Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder.
                          (iii)  On the basis of procedures (but not an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) consisting of:
                       (a)   Reading the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, the board of directors, executive committee and audit committee of the Company and the boards of directors and executive committees of its subsidiaries as set forth in the minute books through a specified date not more than five business days prior to the date of delivery of such letter;
                       (b)   Performing the procedures specified by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for a review of interim financial information as described in Statement of Accounting Standards No. 71, Interim Financial Information, on the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus and reading the unaudited interim financial data, if any, for the period from the date of the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus to the date of the latest available interim financial data; and
                       (c)   Making inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters regarding the specific items for which representations are requested below;
nothing has come to their attention as a result of the foregoing procedures that caused them to believe that:
               (1)   the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus, do not comply as to form in all material respects with the
<Page                                                 9
applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act and the published rules and regulations thereunder;
               (2)   any material modifications should be made to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus, for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles;
               (3)   (i) at the date of the latest available interim financial data and at the specified date not more than five business days prior to the date of the delivery of such letter, there was any change in the capital stock or the long-term debt (other than scheduled repayments of such debt) or any decreases in shareholders' equity of the Company and the subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as compared with the amounts shown in the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or (ii) for the period from the date of the latest available financial data to a specified date not more than five business days prior to the delivery of such letter, there was any change in the capital stock or the long-term debt (other than scheduled repayments of such debt) or any decreases in shareholders' equity of the Company and the subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, except in all instances for changes or decreases which the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur, or PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall state any specific changes or decreases.
         In addition, at the time this Agreement is executed, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters, dated the date of this Agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect set forth in this paragraph (e) and in Schedule I hereto.
                  (f)    Subsequent to the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (e) of this Section 5 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or other), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus.  
<Page                                                                           10
                 (g)   Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
                 (h)   On or after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities.
                 (i)   There shall not have come to the Representatives' attention any facts that would cause the Representatives to believe that the Final Prospectus, at the time it was required to be delivered to a purchaser of the Securities, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances existing at the time of such delivery, not misleading.
        If any of the conditions specified in this Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and their counsel, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or telegraph confirmed in writing.
         6.    . The Company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including (i) the printing and filing of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment or supplement thereto, (ii) the copying of this Agreement, (iii) the preparation, issuance and delivery of the certificates for the Securities to the Underwriters, including capital duties, stamp duties and transfer taxes, if any, payable upon issuance of any of the Securities, the sale of the Securities to the Underwriters and the fees and expenses of any transfer agent or trustee for the Securities, (iv) the fees and expenses of counsel to any such transfer agent or trustee, (v) the fees and disbursements of the Company's counsel and accountants, (vi) the qualification of the Securities under state securities laws in accordance with the provisions of Section 4(e), including filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection therewith and in connection with the preparation of any Blue Sky Survey, (vii) the printing and delivery to the Underwriters of copies of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto and of the Final Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto, (viii) the printing and delivery to the Underwriters of copies of any Blue Sky Survey, and (ix) the fees of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., (x) the preparation, printing, reproduction and delivery to the Underwriters of copies of the Indentures and all supplements and amendments thereto, (xi) any fees charged by rating agencies for the rating of the Securities, (xii) the fees and expenses of any depository and any nominee thereof in connection with the Securities, and, (xiii) if applicable, the fees of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

         If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 5 hereof is not satisfied or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally upon demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
          7.  .
Indemnification and Contribution
                (a)   The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or arise out of or are based upon omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Final Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that (i) the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arises out of or is based upon statements in or omissions from that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification of the Trustee (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee, and (ii) such indemnity with respect to the Basic Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter (or any person controlling such Underwriter) from whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the Securities which are the subject thereof if such person did not receive a copy of the Final Prospectus (or the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented) excluding documents incorporated therein by reference at or prior to the confirmation of the sale of such Securities to such person in any case where such delivery is required by the Act and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in the Basic Prospectus or any preliminary Final Prospectus was corrected in the Final Prospectus (or the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.  
<Page                                                                       12  
                  (b)    Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereof. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that (i) the names of the Underwriters and the statements required by Item 508 of Regulation S-K set forth on the cover page or under the heading "Underwriting" in the Final Prospectus, and (ii) the sentences relating to concessions and reallowances and the paragraph related to stabilization and syndicate covering transactions, under the heading "Underwriting" in the Final Prospectus, constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
             (c)  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 7. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to local counsel), approved by the Representatives in the case of subparagraph (a), representing the indemnified parties under subparagraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the  
<Page                                                                     13
indemnifying party; and except that if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii).
                        (d)  To provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) of this Section 7 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Company on the grounds of policy or otherwise, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion so that the Underwriters are responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the underwriting discount bears to the sum of such discount and the purchase price of the Securities specified in Schedule I hereto and the Company is responsible for the balance; provided, however, that (y) in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and (z) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to clause (y) of this paragraph (d). Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d).
          8.  . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bear to the aggregate amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such non-defaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 8, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding  
Default by an Underwriter

seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
          9.   . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, or (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in the commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or material escalation of hostilities or other calamity or crisis (in the United States or elsewhere) the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable to market the Securities.
Termination
        10.   . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Section 6 and 7 hereof and this Section 10 shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION
3 5/8% SENIOR NOTE, DUE 2008
         BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (herein called the "Corporation," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof), for value received, hereby promises to pay to The Bank of New York Depository (Nominees) Limited, or registered assigns, the principal sum of 1,000,000,000 on March 3, 2008 and to pay interest on said principal sum, annually in arrears on March 3 of each year, at the rate of 3 5/8% per annum, commencing March 3, 2004, or unless no interest has been paid on the Notes, in which case from March 3, 2003, until payment of such principal sum has been made or duly provided for. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the date hereof is after a record date for the Notes, (which shall be the close of business on February 15 next preceding an interest payment date), this Note shall bear interest from such interest payment date; provided, however, that if the Corporation shall default in the payment of interest due on such interest payment date, then this Note shall bear interest from the next preceding interest payment date to which interest has been paid, or, if no interest has been paid on the Notes, from March 3, 2003. Interest on this Note will accrue from the original issue date specified above until the principal amount is paid and will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the interest period and the actual number of days in the calendar year. Interest payments will equal the amount of interest accrued from, and including, the preceding interest payment date in respect of which interest has been paid or duly provided for (or from, and including, the original issue date specified above, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for) to, but excluding, the interest payment date or the maturity date, as the case may be. If the maturity date or an interest payment date falls on a day which is not a Business Day as defined below, principal of or interest payable with respect to such maturity date or interest payment date will be paid on the succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such maturity date or interest payment date, as the case may be. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any interest payment date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes evidencing all or a portion of the same debt as this Note) is registered at the close of business on the record date for such interest payment date.  
<Page>  
         The principal of and interest on this Note are payable in immediately available funds in such coin or currency of the European Union as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts, at the office or agency of the Corporation in London or such other places that the Corporation shall designate as provided in such Indenture; provided, however, that interest may be paid, at the option of the Corporation, by check mailed to the person entitled thereto at his address last appearing on the registry books of the Corporation relating to the Notes. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, payments of principal of and interest payable on the maturity date will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a designated account maintained in London upon (i) receipt of written notice by the Issuing and Paying Agent (as described on the reverse hereof) from the registered holder hereof not less than one Business Day prior to the due date of such principal and (ii) presentation of this Note to the Issuing and Paying Agent, at The Bank of New York, 48 Floor, One Canada Square, London, E14 5AL. Any interest not punctually paid or duly provided for shall be payable as provided in such Indenture. As used herein, "Business Day" means any weekday that is not a legal holiday in New York, New York, Charlotte, North Carolina or Luxembourg and is not a day on which banking institutions in those cities are authorized or required by law or regulation to be closed, and that is also a day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer ("TARGET") System or any successor system is open for business.
th
         If the euro is not available to the Corporation due to circumstances beyond the control of the Corporation (such as the imposition of exchange controls or a disruption in the currency markets), the Corporation is entitled to satisfy its obligation to make the payments in euro by instead making the payment in U.S. dollars on the basis of the exchange rate determined by the exchange rate agent in its sole discretion.
       Reference is made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof, which shall have the same effect as though fully set forth at this place.
      Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee or by an authenticating agent on behalf of the Trustee by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under such Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

The series of which this Note is a part also is designated as the Corporation's 3 5/8% Senior Notes, due 2008 (herein called the "Notes"), initially in the principal amount of  1,000,000,000. The amount of Notes of this series may be increased by the Corporation in the future. The Trustee initially shall act as Security Registrar and Authenticating and Issuing and Paying Agent in connection with the Notes.
        This Note is not subject to any sinking fund.
        Except in those situations in which the Corporation may become obligated to pay additional amounts (as described herein), the Notes of this series are not subject to redemption at the option of the Corporation or repayment at the option of the holder prior to maturity.
       The provisions of Article Fourteen of the Indenture apply to Securities of this Series.
       Subject to the exemptions and limitations set forth below, the Corporation will pay additional amounts to the beneficial owner of this Note that is a non-United States person in order to ensure that every net payment on such Note will not be less, due to payment of United States withholding tax, than the amount then due and payable. For this purpose, a "net payment" on the Note means a payment by the Corporation or any paying agent, including payment of principal and interest, after deduction for any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge of the United States. These additional amounts will constitute additional interest on the Note.

foreign personal holding company;
foreign private foundation or other foreign tax-exempt organization;
passive foreign investment company;

corporation which has accumulated earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax.
     (5)   Additional amounts will not be payable if a payment on the Note is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment, or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely by reason of the beneficial owner of the Note being a bank extending credit pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of business.
     For purposes of items (1) through (5) above, "beneficial owner" includes a fiduciary, settlor, partner, member, shareholder, or beneficiary of the holder if the holder is an estate, trust,  
<Page>                                                                     6

a partnership;
a limited liability company;
another fiscally transparent entity; or
not the sole beneficial owner of the Note, or any portion of the Note.
         (8)   Additional amounts will not be payable if a payment on the Note is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment, or other governmental charge that is collected or imposed by any method other than by withholding from a payment on the Note by the Corporation or any paying agent.
         (9)   Additional amounts will not be payable if a payment on the Note is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment, or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld by reason of a change in law, regulation, or administrative or judicial interpretation that becomes effective more than 15 days after the payment becomes due or is duly provided for, whichever occurs later.
       (10)   Additional amounts will not be payable if a payment on the Note is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment, or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld by reason of the presentation by the beneficial owner of the Note for payment more than 30 days after the date on which such payment becomes due or is duly provided for, whichever occurs later.    
<Page>                                                                    7

        The Notes of this series may be redeemed at the option of the Corporation in whole, but not in part, at any time, on giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice to the Trustee and the holders of the Notes, if the Corporation has or may become obliged to pay additional amounts as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision or any authority thereof or therein having power to tax, or any change in the application or official interpretation of such laws or regulations after the date of this Note.
         Prior to the publication of any notice of redemption, the Corporation shall deliver to the Trustee a certificate signed by the Chief Financial Officer or a Senior Vice President of the Corporation stating that the Corporation is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing the conditions precedent to the right to redeem.
        Notes so redeemed will be redeemed at 100% of their principal amount together with interest accrued up to (but excluding) the date of redemption.
        As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Security Register or registry books of the Corporation relating to the Notes, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the

         No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Corporation may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

       The Notes are issuable only as registered Notes without coupons in denominations of 1,000 and any integral multiple in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture, and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations, as requested by the holder surrendering the same.         If an Event of Default (defined in the Indenture as (i) the Corporation's failure to pay the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Notes when due, or to pay interest on the Notes within 30 days after the same becomes due, (ii) the Corporation's breach of its other covenants contained in this Note or in the Indenture, which breach is not cured within 90 days after written notice by the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in outstanding principal amount of all Securities issued under the Indenture and affected thereby, and (iii) certain events involving the bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation of the Corporation) shall occur with respect to the Notes, the principal of all the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and all other Securities then outstanding under the Indenture and affected thereby, on behalf of the holders of all such Securities, to waive compliance by the Corporation with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in  
<Page>                                                                           9
exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
      No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Corporation, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place, and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

     The Notes of this series shall be dated the date of their authentication.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
         We have acted as counsel to Bank of America Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), in connection with (i) the issuance of 1,000,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of its 3 5/8% Senior Notes, due 2008 (the "Notes") and (ii) the Registration Statement on Form S-3, Registration No. 333-97197 (the "Registration Statement"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), with respect to $20,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Corporation's unsecured debt securities, units, warrants, shares of its preferred stock and shares of its common stock and the Prospectus dated August 20, 2002 constituting a part thereof, as supplemented by the Global Prospectus Supplement dated February 20, 2003 filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act, relating to the Notes.
        As such counsel, we have examined and are familiar with such original or photocopies or certified copies of such records of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, certificates of officers of the Corporation and of public officials and such other documents as we have deemed relevant or necessary as the basis for the opinion set forth below.
