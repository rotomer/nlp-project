CHARLOTTE  Bank of America Corporation today reported first quarter earnings of $2.42 billion, or $1.59 per share (diluted), a 15 percent increase in earnings per share from $2.18 billion, or $1.38 per share, a year ago. The return on common equity increased to 19.92 percent.
 
All three of the company's major businesses increased their net income, a significant accomplishment in the current economic environment. These results reflect the success of the company's customer relationship strategy as multiple products recorded substantial increases, including strong mortgage sales, further penetration in debit and credit card and growth in deposits and loans.
 
"Bank of America's results show that we are uniquely positioned to leverage our brand and scale," said Kenneth D. Lewis, chairman and chief executive officer. "We are clearly demonstrating the benefits of our customer-focused strategy and how it is achieving high shareholder returns."

Revenue
 
Revenue grew 4 percent from the previous year to $8.89 billion.
 
Net interest income of $5.21 billion was relatively unchanged from the previous year.
 
Noninterest income increased 7 percent to $3.69 billion. Strong refinance levels continued to drive higher mortgage banking income results. Card income rose as a result of higher interchange and other fees. Total service charges increased 8 percent.

Page 3
 
Other income was up due primarily to $242 million in gains on residential loan sales taken to reduce prepayment risk.
 
During the quarter, the company realized $273 million in net securities gains as the discretionary portfolio was repositioned in line with market conditions and the company's belief on the direction of interest rates.
 
Efficiency
 
Expenses increased 5 percent from a year ago to $4.72 billion. This growth was driven by the development and launch of a new, national advertising campaign and an increase in employee benefits as healthcare costs escalated. Additionally, the company began expensing employee stock options this quarter, a pre-tax impact of $26 million.
 
Credit quality
 
Credit losses improved from the fourth quarter. The consumer and middle market portfolios continue to be stable to improving. While there were declines in nonperforming large corporate loans, the company remains cautious about this portfolio.

Capital management
 
Total shareholders' equity was $50.05 billion at March 31, 2003, up 4 percent from a year ago and represented 7 percent of period-end assets of $680 billion. The Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 8.20 percent, a decrease of 28 basis points from a year ago and 2 basis points from the December 31, 2002 level.
 
During the quarter, Bank of America repurchased 18.4 million shares and issued 15.2 million shares related to employee options and stock ownership plans. Average common shares outstanding were 1.50 billion in the first quarter, down 3 percent from 1.54 billion a year earlier.
 
Consumer and Commercial Banking
 
Consumer and Commercial Banking (CCB) earned $1.59 billion, up 2 percent from a year ago. Total revenue grew 7 percent to $6.03 billion while expenses increased 9 percent due to marketing costs and an increase in mortgage banking personnel. Return on equity was 32.6 percent and SVA grew $75 million to $1.1 billion.
 
The successful results were driven by the ongoing strength of the consumer and middle market businesses. Not only were transaction levels of credit and debit cards higher, but overall transaction dollar amounts also increased. The credit card delinquency rates decreased. Checking, credit card and debit card accounts increased along with middle market and investment banking services.
 
Noninterest income was up 17 percent to $2.30 billion, driven by higher consumer service charges, mortgage banking income and card income. It was also driven by a 48 percent increase in middle market investment banking income.
 
Net interest income was relatively unchanged at $3.73 billion. Average loans grew 2 percent, led by consumer loan growth as customers continued to take advantage of the interest rate environment for mortgages, home equity lines, automobile loans and credit card accounts. Middle market loans and deposits saw positive growth.
 
Global Corporate and Investment Banking
 
Global Corporate and Investment Banking (GCIB) earned $481 million, up 5 percent from last year, due to favorable market conditions in fixed-income products. Revenue increased 3 percent to $2.34 billion while expenses remained flat. Return on equity was 18.6 percent and SVA increased $80 million to $203 million.
 
Strong trading revenue and expense management drove these results.
 
Investment banking income increased 14 percent to $373 million from last year. The increase in fees was led by the strong demand for fixed income and convertible securities.

Net interest income was up 10 percent to $1.28 billion from a year ago, primarily driven by the growth in trading assets and lower funding costs. Total trading-related revenue in GCIB, which includes trading-related net interest income and trading fees, was $911 million, up 15 percent from last year primarily due to gains in fixed income.
 
Asset Management
 
Asset Management net income rose 2 percent from a year ago to $140 million as a result of lower provision expense. Despite more than 20% declines in market indices, overall revenue decreased only 3 percent to $578 million. Expenses increased 2 percent, reflecting the increase in distribution capabilities over the last several quarters. Return on equity was 20.3 percent and SVA declined $4 million to $66 million. Assets under management decreased 6 percent to $297 billion.
 
Continuing to focus on expanding distribution capabilities, Asset Management will increase its number of financial advisors by approximately 20 percent again this year.
 
More than 75% of the mutual fund assets managed by Banc of America Capital Management LLC were ranked in the top two performance quartiles in their respective Lipper categories for the one-year, three-year and five-year periods ended March 31.
 
Equity Investments
 
Equity Investments reported a loss of $86 million, compared to a loss of $32 million a year ago. Principal Investing reported cash gains of $45 million in the first quarter offset by $77 million in impairments and $41 million in mark-to-market adjustments.

Supplemental Financial Data and Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures
(Dollars in millions)
 
Certain non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) performance measures and ratios, including shareholder value added and taxable-equivalent net interest income, net interest yield and operating efficiency calculated on a taxable-equivalent basis are used in managing the business. Management believes that these measures provide users of this financial information a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. See the Table below for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the three months ended March 31, 2003, December 31, 2002, September 30, 2002, June 30, 2002, and March 31, 2002.
 
Management reviews net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis. In this non-GAAP presentation, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on an equivalent before-tax basis. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis is also used in the calculation of the efficiency ratio and the net interest yield. The efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing noninterest expense by total revenue, measures how much it costs to produce one dollar of revenue. Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis is also used in business segment reporting.
