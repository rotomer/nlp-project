Item 5. Other Events ------------ Bank of America Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Bank of America") and FleetBoston Financial Corporation, a Rhode Island corporation ("FleetBoston"), have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 27, 2003 (the "Merger Agreement"), a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. The description of the Merger Agreement contained herein is qualified in its entirety by the full text of such Exhibit. The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of FleetBoston with and into Bank of America (the "Merger"). The Merger will be treated as a purchase by Bank of America under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and is intended to constitute a "reorganization" for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Merger is completed, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of FleetBoston ("FleetBoston Common Stock"), outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into 0.5553 of a share (the "Exchange Ratio") of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Bank of America ("Bank of America Common Stock"). In addition, all rights with respect to FleetBoston Common Stock pursuant to stock options or other stock-based awards outstanding at such effective time, whether or not then exercisable, will be converted into and will become rights with respect to Bank of America Common Stock on otherwise substantially similar terms, adjusted to reflect the Exchange Ratio. The Merger Agreement also provides, among other things, that: Charles K. Gifford, currently chairman and chief executive officer of FleetBoston, will be the chairman of the board of directors of the merged company; Kenneth D. Lewis, currently chairman and chief executive officer of Bank of America, will be chief executive officer of the merged company; and the board of directors of the merged company will include nineteen members, with twelve from Bank of America and seven from FleetBoston. Completion of the Merger, which is currently anticipated to occur in the second quarter of 2004, is subject to a number of conditions, including shareholder approval by both companies, receipt of all requisite governmental approvals (including the approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), and certain other customary conditions. In connection with the Merger Agreement, each party has granted to the other an irrevocable option (the "Options") to purchase, under certain circumstances, up to 19.9% of its outstanding common shares at a price, subject to certain adjustments, of $31.80 per share (in the case of the Option granted by FleetBoston) and $81.86 per share (in the case of the Option granted by Bank of America) (the "Stock Option Agreements"), copies of which are attached as Exhibits 99.2 and 99.3 hereto and are incorporated herein by reference. The description of the Stock Option Agreements contained herein is qualified in its entirety by the full text of such Exhibits. Under certain circumstances, the granting party may be required to repurchase the Option or the shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of the Option; alternatively, the Option could be surrendered to the granting party, together with any shares purchased under such Option, in exchange for a cash payment of $1.8948 billion. The Stock Option Agreements limit the grantee's Total Profit (as defined in the Stock Option Agreements) to not more than $2.3685 billion. Bank of America anticipates it will file with the SEC pro-forma financial statements with respect to the Merger in approximately twenty days. In accordance with purchase accounting treatment under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the assets and liabilities of FleetBoston will be reflected at fair value. In addition, Bank of America intends to repurchase its common stock in open market or private transactions from time to time under its previously announced stock repurchase program.

The term "Effective Time" shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the Articles of Merger and the Certificate of Merger. 1.3 Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 7-1.1-69 of the RIBCA and Section 259 of the DGCL. 1.4 Conversion of FleetBoston Capital Stock.

(c) All of the shares of FleetBoston Capital Stock converted into the right to receive Bank of America Capital Stock (as defined in Section 1.5) pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and (i) each certificate previously representing any such shares of FleetBoston Common Stock (each a "Certificate") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive (A) a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Bank of America Common Stock and (B) cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of FleetBoston Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Section 1.4 and Section 2.2(e) and (ii) each certificate representing FleetBoston Preferred Stock shall, as of and following the Effective Time, remain outstanding and shall continue to represent the number of shares of Bank of America Mirror Preferred Stock into which such FleetBoston Preferred Stock shall have been converted pursuant to Section 1.4(b) hereof. Certificates previously representing shares of FleetBoston Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of Bank of America Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2, without any interest thereon. If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Bank of America Common Stock or FleetBoston Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio. (d) Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, at the Effective Time, all shares of FleetBoston Capital Stock that are owned by FleetBoston or Bank of America (other than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of Bank of America or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 1.5 Bank of America Capital Stock. At and after the Effective Time, each share of Bank of America Common Stock and each share of Bank of America Preferred Stock (the Bank of America Common Stock and the Bank of America Preferred Stock, the "Bank of America Capital Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger. 1.6 Bank of America Mirror Preferred Stock. Prior to the Effective Time, Bank of America shall take all corporate action necessary to designate the rights and preferences of the Bank of America Mirror Preferred Stock. 1.7 Options and SARs; Other Stock-Based Awards. (a) Effective as of the Effective Time, each then outstanding option to purchase shares of FleetBoston Common Stock (each a "FleetBoston Stock Option") and stock appreciation right to purchase shares of FleetBoston Common Stock or receive a cash payment in respect of FleetBoston Common Stock (each a "FleetBoston SAR") granted, pursuant to the equity-based compensation plans identified on Schedule 3.11(d) (the "FleetBoston Stock Plans"), to any current or former employee or director of, or consultant to, FleetBoston or any of its subsidiaries shall be assumed by Bank of America and shall be converted into an option or a stock appreciation right to purchase a number of shares of Bank of America Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) or in the case of an FleetBoston SAR settled in cash to receive a cash payment in respect of a share of Bank of America Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) (an "Assumed Stock Option" or "Assumed SAR", as the case may be) equal to (i) the number of shares of FleetBoston Common Stock subject to such FleetBoston Stock Option or FleetBoston SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio; and the per share exercise price for Bank of America Common Stock issuable (or payable in the case of a FleetBoston SAR settled in cash) upon the exercise of such Assumed Stock Option or Assumed SAR shall be equal to (i) the exercise price per share of FleetBoston Common Stock at which such FleetBoston Stock Option or FleetBoston SAR was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole cent); provided, however, that in the case of any FleetBoston Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the conversion formula shall be adjusted, if necessary, to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Assumed Stock Options and Assumed SARs shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including expiration date, vesting and exercise provisions) as were applicable to the corresponding FleetBoston Stock Options and FleetBoston SARs immediately prior to the Effective Time (but taking into account any changes thereto, including the acceleration thereof, provided for in the FleetBoston Stock Plans or other FleetBoston Benefit Plan or in any award agreement thereunder by reason of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby); provided, however, that references to FleetBoston shall be deemed to be references to Bank of America. (b) At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to receive shares of FleetBoston Common Stock or benefits measured by the value of a number of shares of FleetBoston Common Stock, and each award of any kind consisting of shares of FleetBoston Common Stock, granted under the FleetBoston Stock Plans or any other FleetBoston Benefit Plan (including restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance stock units, deferred stock units and dividend equivalents), other than FleetBoston Stock Options and FleetBoston SARs (each, a "FleetBoston Stock-Based Award"), whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding or unsatisfied immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall cease to represent a right or award with respect to shares of FleetBoston Common Stock and shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into a right or award with respect to shares of Bank of America Common Stock (an "Assumed Stock-Based Award"), on the same terms and conditions (including expiration date, vesting and exercise provisions) as were applicable under the FleetBoston Stock-Based Awards (but taking into account any changes thereto, including the acceleration thereof, provided for in the FleetBoston Stock Plans or other FleetBoston Benefit Plan or in any award agreement thereunder by reason of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby). The number of shares of Bank of America Common Stock subject to each such Assumed Stock-Based Award shall be equal to the number of shares of FleetBoston Common Stock subject to the FleetBoston Stock-Based Award, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole share of Bank of America Common Stock). All dividend equivalents credited to the account of each holder of a FleetBoston Stock-Based Award as of the Effective Time shall remain credited to such holder's account immediately following the Effective Time, subject to adjustment in accordance with the foregoing.

(a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of one or more Certificates a letter of transmittal in customary form as reasonably agreed to by the parties (which shall specify, among other things, that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the shares of Bank of America Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of FleetBoston Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Bank of America Common Stock to which such holder of FleetBoston Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I, (ii) a check representing the amount of any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and (iii) a check representing the amount of any dividends or distributions then payable pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(i), and the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates. (b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Bank of America Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Article II.

(c) If any certificate representing shares of Bank of America Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition to the issuance thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of Bank of America Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of FleetBoston of the shares of FleetBoston Capital Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of FleetBoston Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for certificates representing shares of Bank of America Common Stock as provided in this Article II. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Bank of America Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to Bank of America Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Bank of America. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Bank of America shall pay to each former stockholder of FleetBoston who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing-sale prices of Bank of America Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") Composite Transactions Tape as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the five full NYSE trading days immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time by (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Bank of America Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4. (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of FleetBoston as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall be paid to Bank of America. Any former stockholders of FleetBoston who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Bank of America for payment of the shares of Bank of America Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Bank of America Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of FleetBoston Common Stock, as the case may be, such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Bank of America, FleetBoston, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of FleetBoston Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. (g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Bank of America, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Bank of America may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Bank of America Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

Within the past five years, neither Bank of America nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution intended to qualify under Section 355(a) of the Code. No disallowance of a deduction under Section 162(m) of the Code for employee remuneration of any amount paid or payable by Bank of America or any of its Subsidiaries under any contract, plan, program or arrangement or understanding would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Bank of America. 4.11 SEC Reports. Bank of America has previously made available to FleetBoston an accurate and complete copy of each (a) final registration statement, prospectus, report, schedule and definitive Joint Proxy Statement filed since January 1, 2000 by Bank of America with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (the "Bank of America Reports") and prior to the date of this Agreement and (b) communication mailed by Bank of America to its stockholders since January 1, 2000 and prior to the date of this Agreement, and no such Bank of America Report or communication, as of the date of such Bank of America Report or communication, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that information as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. Since January 1, 2000, as of their respective dates, all Bank of America Reports filed under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. 4.12 Compliance with Applicable Law. (a) Bank of America and each of its Subsidiaries hold all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses under and pursuant to each, and have complied in all respects with and are not in default in any respect under any, applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation, policy or guideline of any Governmental Entity relating to Bank of America or any of its Subsidiaries, except where the failure to hold such license, franchise, permit or authorization or such noncompliance or default is not reasonably likely to, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Bank of America. (b) Except as is not reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Bank of America, Bank of America and each Bank of America Subsidiary have properly administered all accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary, including accounts for which it serves as a trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents, applicable state and federal law and regulation and common law. None of Bank of America, any Bank of America Subsidiary, or any director, officer or employee of Bank of America or of any Bank of America Subsidiary, has committed any breach of trust or fiduciary duty with respect to any such fiduciary account that is reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Bank of America, and, except as would not be reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Bank of America and the accountings for each such fiduciary account are true and correct and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account. 4.13 Agreements with Regulatory Agencies. Neither Bank of America nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement action issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has been since January 1, 2000, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or has been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or since January 1, 2000, has adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request or suggestion of any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that currently restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business or that in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to pay dividends, its credit or risk management policies, its management or its business, other than those of general application that apply to similarly situated financial holding companies or their Subsidiaries (each, whether or not set forth in the Bank of America Disclosure Schedule, a "Bank of America Regulatory Agreement"), nor has Bank of America or any of its Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2000, by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering or requesting any such Bank of America Regulatory Agreement. 4.14 Interest Rate Risk Management Instruments. Except as would not be reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Bank of America, (1) all interest rate swaps, caps, floors and option agreements and other interest rate risk management arrangements, whether entered into for the account of Bank of America or for the account of a customer of Bank of America or one of its Subsidiaries, were entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and in accordance with prudent banking practice and applicable rules, regulations and policies of any Regulatory Authority and with counterparties believed to be financially responsible at the time and are legal, valid and binding obligations of Bank of America or one of its Subsidiaries enforceable against it in accordance with their terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies), and are in full force and effect, (2) each of its Subsidiaries have duly performed their obligations thereunder to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued, and (3) to Bank of America's knowledge, there are no breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder. 4.15 Undisclosed Liabilities. Except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Bank of America included in the Bank of America 10-Q (including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since June 30, 2003, since such date, neither Bank of America nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due) that, either individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Bank of America. 4.16 Environmental Liability. There are no legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private environmental investigations or remediation activities or governmental investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or that are reasonably likely to result in the imposition, on Bank of America of any liability or obligation arising under common law or under any local, state or federal environmental statute, regulation or ordinance including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, pending or threatened against Bank of America, which liability or obligation is reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Bank of America. To the knowledge of Bank of America, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or governmental investigation that would impose any liability or obligation that would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Bank of America. Bank of America is not subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or with any Governmental Entity or third party imposing any liability or obligation with respect to the foregoing that is reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Bank of America. 4.17 State Takeover Laws. The Board of Directors of Bank of America has approved this Agreement and the Bank of America Stock Option Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby as required to render inapplicable to such agreements and transactions Section 203 of the DGCL and, to the knowledge of Bank of America, any Takeover Statutes. 4.18 Reorganization. As of the date of this Agreement, Bank of America is not aware of any fact or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 4.19 Opinions. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, Bank of America has received an opinion from Goldman, Sachs & Co. to the effect that as of the date thereof and based upon and subject to the matters set forth therein, the Exchange Ratio is fair to Bank of America from a financial point of view. Such opinion has not been amended or rescinded as of the date of this Agreement. 4.20 Bank of America Information. The information relating to Bank of America and its Subsidiaries to be contained in the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form S-4, or the information relating to Bank of America and its Subsidiaries that is provided by Bank of America or its representatives for inclusion in any other document filed with any other Regulatory Agency in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading.

(a) From the Effective Time through December 31, 2004 or such later date to the extent December 31, 2004 is not practicable based on the occurrence of the Effective Time (such date being referred to herein as the "Benefits Transition Date"), Bank of America shall provide the employees of FleetBoston and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the "Covered Employees") with employee benefits and compensation plans, programs and arrangements that are substantially similar, in the aggregate, to the employee benefits and compensation plans, programs and arrangements provided by FleetBoston or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Benefits Transition Date, Bank of America shall provide the Covered Employees with employee benefits and compensation plans, programs and arrangements that are equivalent to those provided to similarly situated employees of Bank of America and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, from and after the Effective Time, a Covered Employee who is terminated during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the second anniversary thereof shall be entitled to receive the severance payments and benefits under the applicable FleetBoston severance plan or policy as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (without amendment during such two year period following the Effective Time). (b) From and after the Effective Time, Bank of America shall (i) provide all Covered Employees with service credit for purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and levels of benefits (but not for benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.7(b)), under any employee benefit or compensation plan, program or arrangement adopted, maintained or contributed to by Bank of America or any of its Subsidiaries in which Covered Employees are eligible to participate, for all periods of employment with FleetBoston or any of its Subsidiaries (or their predecessor entities) prior to the Effective Time, (ii) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required physical examinations under any welfare benefit plans of Bank of America or any of its Subsidiaries to be waived with respect to the Covered Employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent waived under the corresponding plan in which the applicable Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and, with respect to life insurance coverage, up to the Covered Employee's current level of insurability, and (iii) give the Covered Employees and their eligible dependents credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time (or commencement of participation in a plan of Bank of America or any of its Subsidiaries) occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time (or the date of commencement of participation in a plan of Bank of America or any of its Subsidiaries). For purposes of any cash balance pension plan maintained or contributed to by Bank of America or any of its Subsidiaries in which Covered Employees become eligible to participate following the Effective Time (excluding the cash balance pension plans maintained or sponsored by FleetBoston immediately prior to the Effective Time), the Covered Employees' level of benefit accruals under any such plans (for periods of service following the date on which the Covered Employees commence participation in such plans) shall be determined based on the Covered Employees' credited service prior to the Effective Time (as recognized for the same purpose by FleetBoston for purposes of the cash balance pension plans maintained or sponsored by FleetBoston immediately prior to the Effective Time) and with the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time. (c) From and after the Effective Time, Bank of America shall honor all accrued and vested benefit obligations to and contractual rights of current and former employees of FleetBoston and its Subsidiaries under the FleetBoston Benefit Plans. Bank of America agrees to take all action necessary to effectuate and satisfy the agreements and obligations set forth in Section 6.7(c) of the FleetBoston Disclosure Schedule.

(a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of FleetBoston or any of its Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at the request of FleetBoston or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or agent of another person (the "Indemnified Parties"), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of FleetBoston or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties shall cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. From and after the Effective Time, Bank of America shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent provided by applicable law, the FleetBoston Certificate, the FleetBoston Bylaws and any agreement set forth in Section 6.8 of the FleetBoston Disclosure Schedule, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reimbursement for reasonable fees and expenses incurred in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party as provided by the FleetBoston Certificate, the FleetBoston Bylaws and any agreement set forth in Section 6.8 of the FleetBoston Disclosure Schedule), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. (b) Bank of America shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the individuals serving as officers and directors of FleetBoston or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of six years from the Effective Time by the directors' and officers' liability insurance policy maintained by FleetBoston (provided that Bank of America may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time that were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such. (c) The provisions of this Section 6.8 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. 6.9 Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Bank of America, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of FleetBoston, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either party to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense of, Bank of America. 6.10 Advice of Changes. Each of Bank of America and FleetBoston shall promptly advise the other of any change or event (i) having or reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) that it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement; provided further that a failure to comply with this Section 6.10 shall not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in Article VI to be satisfied. 6.11 Dividends. After the date of this Agreement, each of Bank of America and FleetBoston shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in respect of Bank of America Common Stock and FleetBoston Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties that holders of FleetBoston Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, for any quarter with respect to their shares of FleetBoston Common Stock and any shares of Bank of America Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger. 6.12 Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b). Bank of America and FleetBoston agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain FleetBoston Insiders (as defined below) in connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that FleetBoston Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of FleetBoston Common Stock and FleetBoston Stock Options into shares of Bank of America Common Stock in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 6.12. Assuming that FleetBoston delivers to Bank of America the Section 16 Information (as defined below) in a timely fashion, the Board of Directors of Bank of America, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by FleetBoston Insiders of Bank of America Common Stock in exchange for shares of FleetBoston Common Stock, and of options on Bank of America Common Stock upon conversion of options on FleetBoston Common Stock, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act. "Section 16 Information" shall mean information accurate in all material respects regarding FleetBoston Insiders, the number of shares of FleetBoston Common Stock held by each such FleetBoston Insider and expected to be exchanged for Bank of America Common Stock in the Merger, and the number and description of the options on FleetBoston Common Stock held by each such FleetBoston Insider and expected to be converted into options on Bank of America Common Stock in connection with the Merger; provided that the requirement for a description of any FleetBoston Stock Options shall be deemed to be satisfied if copies of all FleetBoston Stock Plans, and forms of agreements evidencing grants thereunder, under which such FleetBoston Stock Options have been granted, have been made available to Bank of America. "FleetBoston Insiders" shall mean those officers and directors of FleetBoston who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are listed in the Section 16 Information. 6.13 No Solicitation. (a) None of FleetBoston, its Subsidiaries or any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained representative) of FleetBoston or any of its Subsidiaries shall directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate or encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) or take any other action designed to facilitate any inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, share exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including, without limitation, by way of a tender offer) or similar transactions involving FleetBoston or any of its Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would constitute an Alternative Transaction (any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals being referred to herein as an "Acquisition Proposal"), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an Alternative Transaction or (iii) enter into any agreement regarding any Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of FleetBoston shall be permitted, prior to the meeting of FleetBoston shareholders to be held pursuant to Section 6.3, and subject to compliance with the other terms of this Section 6.13 and to first entering into a confidentiality agreement with the person proposing such Acquisition Proposal on terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to FleetBoston than, those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, to consider and participate in discussions and negotiations with respect to a bona fide Acquisition Proposal received by FleetBoston that the Board of Directors of FleetBoston, if and only to the extent that the Board of Directors of FleetBoston reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would cause it to violate its fiduciary duties. As used in this Agreement, "Alternative Transaction" means any of (i) a transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) other than Bank of America or its affiliates, directly or indirectly, acquires or would acquire more than 25 percent of the outstanding shares of FleetBoston Common Stock or outstanding voting power or of any new series or new class of preferred stock that would be entitled to a class or series vote with respect to the Merger, whether from FleetBoston or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger, share exchange, consolidation or other business combination involving FleetBoston (other than the Merger), (iii) any transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) other than Bank of America or its affiliates acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of subsidiaries of FleetBoston and securities of the entity surviving any merger or business combination including any of FleetBoston's Subsidiaries) of FleetBoston, or any of its subsidiaries representing more than 25 percent of the fair market value of all the assets, net revenues or net income of FleetBoston and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction, or (iv) any other consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving FleetBoston or any of its subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as a result of which the holders of shares of FleetBoston Common Stock immediately prior to such transaction do not, in the aggregate, own at least 75 percent of each of the outstanding shares of common stock and the outstanding voting power of the surviving or resulting entity in such transaction immediately after the consummation thereof in substantially the same proportion as such holders held the shares of FleetBoston Common Stock immediately prior to the consummation thereof. (b) FleetBoston shall notify Bank of America promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any material modification of or material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to FleetBoston or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of FleetBoston or any Subsidiary by any Person or entity that informs the Board of Directors of FleetBoston or any Subsidiary that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to Bank of America shall be made orally and in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal or intending to make or considering making an Acquisition Proposal or requesting non-public information or access to the books and records of FleetBoston or any Subsidiary, and the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or modification or amendment to an Acquisition Proposal. FleetBoston shall keep Bank of America fully informed, on a current basis, of any material changes in the status and any material changes or modifications in the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. FleetBoston shall also promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, notify Bank of America, orally and in writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal in accordance with Section 6.13(a). (c) Nothing contained in this Section 6.13 shall prohibit FleetBoston or its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. (d) FleetBoston and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than Bank of America) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons other than Bank of America who have been furnished confidential information regarding FleetBoston in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal within the 12 months prior to the date hereof promptly to return or destroy such information. FleetBoston agrees not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to, release any third party from the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement to which FleetBoston or its Subsidiaries is or may become a party, and shall immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any approval that may have been heretofore given under any such provisions authorizing any person to make an Acquisition Proposal. (e) FleetBoston shall ensure that the officers, directors and all employees, agents and representatives (including any investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other retained representatives) of FleetBoston or its Subsidiaries are aware of the restrictions described in this Section 6.13 as reasonably necessary to avoid violations thereof. It is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.13 by any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained representative) of FleetBoston or its Subsidiaries, at the direction or with the consent of FleetBoston or its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.13 by FleetBoston. 6.14 Restructuring Efforts. If either Bank of America or FleetBoston shall have failed to obtain the requisite vote or votes of its shareholders for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at a duly held meeting of its shareholders or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, each of the parties shall in good faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transaction provided for herein (it being understood that neither party shall have any obligation to alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration in a manner adverse to such party or its shareholders) and to resubmit the transaction to their respective shareholders for approval.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any termination of this Agreement, the Stock Option Agreements shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms. 8.3 Amendment. Subject to compliance with applicable law and Section 1.1(b), this Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with Merger by the shareholders of FleetBoston or Bank of America; provided, however, that after any approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the shareholders of FleetBoston and Bank of America, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form of the consideration to be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of FleetBoston Common Stock, other than as contemplated by this Agreement.

Lewis Title: Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Signature Page to Agreement and Plan of Merger
Form of Affiliate Letter Bank of America Corporation - ------------------------- - ------------------------- Ladies and Gentlemen: I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of FleetBoston Financial Corporation, a Rhode Island corporation ("FleetBoston"), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Rules and Regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). I have been further advised that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of October 27, 2003 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and between Bank of America Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Bank of America"), and FleetBoston, FleetBoston shall be merged with and into Bank of America (the "Merger") and each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of FleetBoston ("FleetBoston Common Stock") shall be converted into the right to receive 0.5553 of a share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Bank of America ("Bank of America Common Stock"). All terms used in this letter but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement. I represent, warrant and covenant to Bank of America that in the event I receive any Bank of America Common Stock as a result of the Merger: (a) I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of Bank of America Common Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations. (b) I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed its requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Bank of America Common Stock to the extent I believed necessary with my counsel or counsel for FleetBoston. (c) I have been advised that the issuance of Bank of America Common Stock to me pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised that, since at the time the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the stockholders of FleetBoston I may be deemed to have been an affiliate of FleetBoston and the distribution by me of Bank of America Common Stock has not been registered under the Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Bank of America Common Stock issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act, or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Bank of America, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act. (d) I understand that Bank of America is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of Bank of America Common Stock by me or on my behalf under the Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available. (e) I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Bank of America's transfer agents with respect to Bank of America Common Stock and that there will be placed on the certificates for Bank of America Common Stock issued to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance: "The securities represented by this certificate have been issued in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 applies and may only be sold or otherwise transferred in compliance with the requirements of Rule 145 or pursuant to a registration statement under said act or an exemption from such registration." (f) I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my Bank of America Common Stock has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, Bank of America reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee: "The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who received such shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares have been acquired by the holder not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933." It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend, and/or the issuance of a letter to Bank of America's transfer agent removing such stop transfer instructions, and the above restrictions on sale will cease to apply, if (A) one year (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(2) under the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Closing Date and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (B) if two years (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(3) under the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Effective Date and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (C) I shall have delivered to Bank of America (i) a copy of a letter from the staff of the Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Bank of America, or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to Bank of America, to the effect that such legend and/or stop transfer instructions are not required for purposes of the Securities Act or (ii) reasonably satisfactory evidence or representations that the securities represented by such certificates are being or have been transferred in a transaction made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under the Securities Act or pursuant to an effective registration under the Securities Act. I recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to (i) my spouse, (ii) any relative of mine or my spouse occupying my home, (iii) any trust or estate in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% beneficial interest or of which any of us serves as trustee, executor or in any similar capacity and (iv) any corporate or other organization in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% of any class of equity securities or of the equity interest. It is understood and agreed that this Letter Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect if the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. Execution of this letter should not be construed as an admission on my part that I am an "affiliate" of FleetBoston as described in the first paragraph of this letter or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.

(b) In the event that any additional shares of Common Stock are either (i) issued or otherwise become outstanding after the date of this Agreement (other than pursuant to this Agreement) or (ii) redeemed, repurchased, retired or otherwise cease to be outstanding after the date of this Agreement, the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Option shall be increased or decreased, as appropriate, so that, after such issuance, such number equals 19.9% of the number of shares of Common Stock then issued and outstanding without giving effect to any shares subject or issued pursuant to the Option. Nothing contained in this Section 1(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to authorize Issuer or Grantee to breach any provision of the Merger Agreement. 2. (a) The Holder (as hereinafter defined) may exercise the Option, in whole or part, and from time to time, if, but only if, both an Initial Triggering Event (as hereinafter defined) and a Subsequent Triggering Event (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred prior to the occurrence of an Exercise Termination Event (as hereinafter defined), provided that the Holder shall have sent the written notice of such exercise (as provided in subsection (e) of this Section 2) within 180 days following such Subsequent Triggering Event. Each of the following shall be an "Exercise Termination Event": (i) the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of the Merger; (ii) termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with the provisions thereof if such termination occurs prior to the occurrence of an Initial Triggering Event except a termination by Grantee pursuant to Section 8.1(d) of the Merger Agreement (unless the breach by Issuer giving rise to such right of termination is non-volitional); or (iii) the passage of 18 months after termination of the Merger Agreement if such termination follows the occurrence of an Initial Triggering Event or is a termination by Grantee pursuant to Section 8.1(d) of the Merger Agreement (unless the breach by Issuer giving rise to such right of termination is non-volitional). The term "Holder" shall mean the holder or holders of the Option. (b) The term "Initial Triggering Event" shall mean any of the following events or transactions occurring after the date hereof: (i) Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries (each an "Issuer Subsidiary"), without having received Grantee's prior written consent, shall have entered into an agreement to engage in an Acquisition Transaction (as hereinafter defined) with any person (the term "person" for purposes of this Agreement having the meaning assigned thereto in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), and the rules and regulations thereunder) other than Grantee or any of its Subsidiaries (each a "Grantee Subsidiary") or the Board of Directors of Issuer shall have recommended that the stockholders of Issuer approve or accept any Acquisition Transaction with any person other than Grantee or a Subsidiary of Grantee. For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean (w) a merger, consolidation or share exchange, or any similar transaction, involving Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")) of Issuer, (x) a purchase, lease or other acquisition or assumption of all or a substantial portion of the assets or deposits of Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary of Issuer, (y) a purchase or other acquisition (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise) of securities representing 10% or more of the voting power of Issuer, or (z) any substantially similar transaction; provided, however, that in no event shall any merger, consolidation, purchase or similar transaction involving only the Issuer and one or more of its Subsidiaries or involving only any two or more of such Subsidiaries, be deemed to be an Acquisition Transaction, provided that any such transaction is not entered into in violation of the terms of the Merger Agreement; (ii) Issuer or any Issuer Subsidiary, without having received Grantee's prior written consent, shall have authorized, recommended, proposed or publicly announced its intention to authorize, recommend or propose, to engage in an Acquisition Transaction with any person other than Grantee or a Grantee Subsidiary, or the Board of Directors of Issuer shall have publicly withdrawn or modified, or publicly announced its intention to withdraw or modify, in any manner adverse to Grantee, its recommendation that the stockholders of Issuer approve the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (iii) Any person other than Grantee, any Grantee Subsidiary or any Issuer Subsidiary acting in a fiduciary capacity in the ordinary course of its business shall have acquired beneficial ownership or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (the term "beneficial ownership" for purposes of this Agreement having the meaning assigned thereto in Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder); (iv) Any person other than Grantee or any Grantee Subsidiary shall have made a bona fide proposal to Issuer or its stockholders by public announcement or written communication that is or becomes the subject of public disclosure to engage in an Acquisition Transaction; (v) After an overture is made by a third party to Issuer or its stockholders to engage in an Acquisition Transaction, Issuer shall have breached any covenant or obligation contained in the Merger Agreement and such breach (x) would entitle Grantee to terminate the Merger Agreement and (y) shall not have been cured prior to the Notice Date (as defined below); or (vi) Any person other than Grantee or any Grantee Subsidiary, other than in connection with a transaction to which Grantee has given its prior written consent, shall have filed an application or notice with the Federal Reserve Board, or other federal or state bank regulatory authority, which application or notice has been accepted for processing, for approval to engage in an Acquisition Transaction. (c) The term "Subsequent Triggering Event" shall mean either of the following events or transactions occurring after the date hereof: (i) The acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the then outstanding Common Stock; or (ii) The occurrence of the Initial Triggering Event described in paragraph (i) of subsection (b) of this Section 2, except that the percentage referred to in clause (y) shall be 20%. (d) Issuer shall notify Grantee promptly in writing of the occurrence of any Initial Triggering Event or Subsequent Triggering Event of which it has knowledge (together, a "Triggering Event"), it being understood that the giving of such notice by Issuer shall not be a condition to the right of the Holder to exercise the Option. (e) In the event the Holder is entitled to and wishes to exercise the Option, it shall send to Issuer a written notice (the date of which being herein referred to as the "Notice Date") specifying (i) the total number of shares it will purchase pursuant to such exercise and (ii) a place and date not earlier than three business days nor later than 60 business days from the Notice Date for the closing of such purchase (the "Closing Date"); provided that if prior notification to or approval of the Federal Reserve Board or any other regulatory agency is required in connection with such purchase, the Holder shall as soon as reasonably practicable file the required notice or application for approval and shall expeditiously process the same and the period of time that otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence shall run instead from the date on which any required notification periods have expired or been terminated or such approvals have been obtained and any requisite waiting period or periods shall have passed. Any exercise of the Option shall be deemed to occur on the Notice Date relating thereto. (f) At the closing referred to in subsection (e) of this Section 2, the Holder shall pay to Issuer the aggregate purchase price for the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to the exercise of the Option in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated by Issuer, provided that failure or refusal of Issuer to designate such a bank account shall not preclude the Holder from exercising the Option. (g) At such closing, simultaneously with the delivery of immediately available funds as provided in subsection (f) of this Section 2, Issuer shall deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of Common Stock purchased by the Holder and, if the Option should be exercised in part only, a new Option evidencing the rights of the Holder thereof to purchase the balance of the shares purchasable hereunder, and the Holder shall deliver to Issuer this Agreement and a letter agreeing that the Holder will not offer to sell or otherwise dispose of such shares in violation of applicable law or the provisions of this Agreement. (h) Certificates for Common Stock delivered at a closing hereunder may be endorsed with a restrictive legend that shall read substantially as follows: "The transfer of the shares represented by this certificate is subject to certain provisions of an agreement between the registered holder hereof and Issuer and to resale restrictions arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. A copy of such agreement is on file at the principal office of Issuer and will be provided to the holder hereof without charge upon receipt by Issuer of a written request therefor." It is understood and agreed that: (i) the reference to the resale restrictions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the Holder shall have delivered to Issuer a copy of a letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Issuer, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the 1933 Act; (ii) the reference to the provisions to this Agreement in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the shares have been sold or transferred in compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and under circumstances that do not require the retention of such reference; and (iii) the legend shall be removed in its entirety if the conditions in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) are both satisfied. In addition, such certificates shall bear any other legend as may be required by law. (i) Upon the giving by the Holder to Issuer of the written notice of exercise of the Option provided for under subsection (e) of this Section 2 and the tender of the applicable purchase price in immediately available funds, the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of Issuer shall then be closed or that certificates representing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to the Holder. Issuer shall pay all expenses, and any and all United States federal, state and local taxes and other charges that may be payable in connection with the preparation, issue and delivery of stock certificates under this Section 2 in the name of the Holder or its assignee, transferee or designee. 3. Issuer agrees: (i) that it shall at all times maintain, free from preemptive rights, sufficient authorized but unissued or treasury shares of Common Stock so that the Option may be exercised without additional authorization of Common Stock after giving effect to all other options, warrants, convertible securities and other rights to purchase Common Stock; (ii) that it will not, by charter amendment or through reorganization, consolidation, merger, dissolution or sale of assets, or by any other voluntary act, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the covenants, stipulations or conditions to be observed or performed hereunder by Issuer; (iii) promptly to take all action as may from time to time be required (including (x) complying with all premerger notification, reporting and waiting period requirements specified in 15 U.S.C. 18a and regulations promulgated thereunder and (y) in the event, under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA"), or the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, or any state banking law, prior approval of or notice to the Federal Reserve Board or to any state or other regulatory authority is necessary before the Option may be exercised, cooperating fully with the Holder in preparing such applications or notices and providing such information to the Federal Reserve Board or such other regulatory authority as they may require) in order to permit the Holder to exercise the Option and Issuer duly and effectively to issue shares of Common Stock pursuant hereto; and (iv) promptly to take all action provided herein to protect the rights of the Holder against dilution. 4. This Agreement (and the Option granted hereby) are exchangeable, without expense, at the option of the Holder, upon presentation and surrender of this Agreement at the principal office of Issuer, for other Agreements providing for Options of different denominations entitling the holder thereof to purchase, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as are set forth herein, in the aggregate the same number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder. The terms "Agreement" and "Option" as used herein include any Stock Option Agreements and related Options for which this Agreement (and the Option granted hereby) may be exchanged. Upon receipt by Issuer of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Agreement, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) of reasonably satisfactory indemnification, and upon surrender and cancellation of this Agreement, if mutilated, Issuer will execute and deliver a new Agreement of like tenor and date. Any such new Agreement executed and delivered shall constitute an additional contractual obligation on the part of Issuer, whether or not the Agreement so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated shall at any time be enforceable by anyone. 5. In addition to the adjustment in the number of shares of Common Stock that are purchasable upon exercise of the Option pursuant to Section 1 of this Agreement, the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the Option and the Option Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 5. In the event of any change in, or distributions in respect of, the Common Stock by reason of stock dividends, split-ups, mergers, recapitalizations, combinations, subdivisions, conversions, exchanges of shares, distributions on or in respect of the Common Stock that would be prohibited under the terms of the Merger Agreement, or the like, the type and number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon exercise hereof and the Option Price shall be appropriately adjusted in such manner as shall fully preserve the economic benefits provided hereunder and proper provision shall be made in any agreement governing any such transaction to provide for such proper adjustment and the full satisfaction of the Issuer's obligations hereunder. 6. Upon the occurrence of a Subsequent Triggering Event that occurs prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer shall, at the request of Grantee delivered within 180 days of such Subsequent Triggering Event (whether on its own behalf or on behalf of any subsequent holder of this Option (or part thereof) or any of the shares of Common Stock issued pursuant hereto), promptly prepare, file and keep current a shelf registration statement under the 1933 Act covering this Option and any shares issued and issuable pursuant to this Option and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective and remain current in order to permit the sale or other disposition of this Option and any shares of Common Stock issued upon total or partial exercise of this Option ("Option Shares") in accordance with any plan of disposition requested by Grantee. Issuer will use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement first to become effective and then to remain effective for such period not in excess of 180 days from the day such registration statement first becomes effective or such shorter time as may be reasonably necessary to effect such sales or other dispositions. Grantee shall have the right to demand two such registrations. The foregoing notwithstanding, if, at the time of any request by Grantee for registration of the Option or Option Shares as provided above, Issuer is in registration with respect to an underwritten public offering of shares of Common Stock, and if in the good faith judgment of the managing underwriter or managing underwriters, or, if none, the sole underwriter or underwriters, of such offering the inclusion of the Holder's Option or Option Shares would interfere with the successful marketing of the shares of Common Stock offered by Issuer, the number of Option Shares otherwise to be covered in the registration statement contemplated hereby may be reduced; provided, however, that after any such required reduction the number of Option Shares to be included in such offering for the account of the Holder shall constitute at least 25% of the total number of shares to be sold by the Holder and Issuer in the aggregate; and provided further, however, that if such reduction occurs, then the Issuer shall file a registration statement for the balance as promptly as practicable and no reduction shall thereafter occur. Each such Holder shall provide all information reasonably requested by Issuer for inclusion in any registration statement to be filed hereunder. If requested by any such Holder in connection with such registration, Issuer shall become a party to any underwriting agreement relating to the sale of such shares, but only to the extent of obligating itself in respect of representations, warranties, indemnities and other agreements customarily included in secondary offering underwriting agreements for the Issuer. Upon receiving any request under this Section 6 from any Holder, Issuer agrees to send a copy thereof to any other person known to Issuer to be entitled to registration rights under this Section 6, in each case by promptly mailing the same, postage prepaid, to the address of record of the persons entitled to receive such copies. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall Issuer be obligated to effect more than two registrations pursuant to this Section 6 by reason of the fact that there shall be more than one Grantee as a result of any assignment or division of this Agreement. 7. (a) Immediately prior to the occurrence of a Repurchase Event (as defined below), (i) following a request of the Holder, delivered prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer (or any successor thereto) shall repurchase the Option from the Holder at a price (the "Option Repurchase Price") equal to the number of shares for which this Option may then be exercised multiplied by the amount by which (A) the Market/Offer Price (as defined below) exceeds (B) the Option Price, and (ii) at the request of the owner of Option Shares from time to time (the "Owner"), delivered within 90 days of such occurrence (or such later period as provided in Section 10), Issuer shall repurchase such number of the Option Shares from the Owner as the Owner shall designate at a price (the "Option Share Repurchase Price") equal to the Market/Offer Price multiplied by the number of Option Shares so designated. The term "Market/Offer Price" shall mean the highest of (i) the price per share of Common Stock at which a tender offer or exchange offer therefor has been made, (ii) the price per share of Common Stock to be paid by any third party pursuant to an agreement with Issuer, (iii) the highest closing price for shares of Common Stock within the six-month period immediately preceding the date the Holder gives notice of the required repurchase of this Option or the Owner gives notice of the required repurchase of Option Shares, as the case may be, or (iv) in the event of a sale of all or a substantial portion of Issuer's assets, the sum of the price paid in such sale for such assets and the current market value of the remaining assets of Issuer as determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or the Owner, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the Issuer, divided by the number of shares of Common Stock of Issuer outstanding at the time of such sale. In determining the Market/Offer Price, the value of consideration other than cash shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or Owner, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the Issuer. (b) The Holder and the Owner, as the case may be, may exercise its right to require Issuer to repurchase the Option and any Option Shares pursuant to this Section 7 by surrendering for such purpose to Issuer, at its principal office, this Agreement or certificates for Option Shares, as applicable, accompanied by a written notice or notices stating that the Holder or the Owner, as the case may be, elects to require Issuer to repurchase this Option and/or the Option Shares in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7. Within the latter to occur of (x) five business days after the surrender of the Option and/or certificates representing Option Shares and the receipt of such notice or notices relating thereto and (y) the time that is immediately prior to the occurrence of a Repurchase Event, Issuer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Holder the Option Repurchase Price and/or to the Owner the Option Share Repurchase Price therefor or the portion thereof, if any, that Issuer is not then prohibited under applicable law and regulation from so delivering. (c) To the extent that Issuer is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from repurchasing the Option and/or the Option Shares in full, Issuer shall immediately so notify the Holder and/or the Owner and thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, the portion of the Option Repurchase Price and the Option Share Repurchase Price, respectively, that it is no longer prohibited from delivering, within five business days after the date on which Issuer is no longer so prohibited; provided, however, that if Issuer at any time after delivery of a notice of repurchase pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 7 is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from delivering to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, the Option Repurchase Price and the Option Share Repurchase Price, respectively, in full (and Issuer hereby undertakes to use its best efforts to obtain all required regulatory and legal approvals and to file any required notices, in each case as promptly as practicable in order to accomplish such repurchase), the Holder or Owner may revoke its notice of repurchase of the Option or the Option Shares either in whole or to the extent of the prohibition, whereupon, in the latter case, Issuer shall promptly (i) deliver to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, that portion of the Option Repurchase Price or the Option Share Repurchase Price that Issuer is not prohibited from delivering; and (ii) deliver, as appropriate, either (A) to the Holder, a new Stock Option Agreement evidencing the right of the Holder to purchase that number of shares of Common Stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock for which the surrendered Stock Option Agreement was exercisable at the time of delivery of the notice of repurchase by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Option Repurchase Price less the portion thereof theretofore delivered to the Holder and the denominator of which is the Option Repurchase Price, or (B) to the Owner, a certificate for the Option Shares it is then so prohibited from repurchasing. (d) For purposes of this Section 7, a Repurchase Event shall be deemed to have occurred (i) upon the consummation of any merger, consolidation, share exchange or similar transaction involving Issuer or any purchase, lease or other acquisition of all or a substantial portion of the assets of Issuer, other than any such transaction which would not constitute an Acquisition Transaction pursuant to the provisos to Section 2(b)(i) hereof or (ii) upon the acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock, provided that no such event shall constitute a Repurchase Event unless a Subsequent Triggering Event shall have occurred prior to an Exercise Termination Event. The parties hereto agree that Issuer's obligations to repurchase the Option or Option Shares under this Section 7 shall not terminate upon the occurrence of an Exercise Termination Event unless no Subsequent Triggering Event shall have occurred prior to the occurrence of an Exercise Termination Event. 8. (a) In the event that prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer shall enter into an agreement (i) to consolidate with or merge into any person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, to merge into Issuer and Issuer shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other person or cash or any other property or the then outstanding shares of Common Stock shall after such merger represent less than 50% of the outstanding voting shares and voting share equivalents of the merged company, or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, then, and in each such case, the agreement governing such transaction shall make proper provision so that the Option shall, upon the consummation of any such transaction and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, be converted into, or exchanged for, an option (the "Substitute Option"), at the election of the Holder, of either (x) the Acquiring Corporation (as hereinafter defined) or (y) any person that controls the Acquiring Corporation. (b) The following terms have the meanings indicated: (A) "Acquiring Corporation" shall mean (i) the continuing or surviving corporation of a consolidation or merger with Issuer (if other than Issuer), (ii) Issuer in a merger in which Issuer is the continuing or surviving person, and (iii) the transferee of all or substantially all of Issuer's assets. (B) "Substitute Common Stock" shall mean the common stock issued by the issuer of the Substitute Option upon exercise of the Substitute Option. (C) "Assigned Value" shall mean the Market/Offer Price, as defined in Section 7. (D) "Average Price" shall mean the average closing price of a share of the Substitute Common Stock for the one year immediately preceding the consolidation, merger or sale in question, but in no event higher than the closing price of the shares of Substitute Common Stock on the day preceding such consolidation, merger or sale; provided that if Issuer is the issuer of the Substitute Option, the Average Price shall be computed with respect to a share of common stock issued by the person merging into Issuer or by any company which controls or is controlled by such person, as the Holder may elect. (c) The Substitute Option shall have the same terms as the Option, provided, that if the terms of the Substitute Option cannot, for legal reasons, be the same as the Option, such terms shall be as similar as possible and in no event less advantageous to the Holder. The issuer of the Substitute Option shall also enter into an agreement with the then Holder or Holders of the Substitute Option in substantially the same form as this Agreement, which shall be applicable to the Substitute Option. (d) The Substitute Option shall be exercisable for such number of shares of Substitute Common Stock as is equal to the Assigned Value multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock for which the Option is then exercisable, divided by the Average Price. The exercise price of the Substitute Option per share of Substitute Common Stock shall then be equal to the Option Price multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock for which the Option is then exercisable and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock for which the Substitute Option is exercisable. (e) In no event, pursuant to any of the foregoing paragraphs, shall the Substitute Option be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the shares of Substitute Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise of the Substitute Option. In the event that the Substitute Option would be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the shares of Substitute Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise but for this clause (e), the issuer of the Substitute Option (the "Substitute Option Issuer") shall make a cash payment to Holder equal to the excess of (i) the value of the Substitute Option without giving effect to the limitation in this clause (e) over (ii) the value of the Substitute Option after giving effect to the limitation in this clause (e). This difference in value shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or the Owner, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the Acquiring Corporation. (f) Issuer shall not enter into any transaction described in subsection (a) of this Section 8 unless the Acquiring Corporation and any person that controls the Acquiring Corporation assume in writing all the obligations of Issuer hereunder. 9. (a) At the request of the holder of the Substitute Option (the "Substitute Option Holder"), the Substitute Option Issuer shall repurchase the Substitute Option from the Substitute Option Holder at a price (the "Substitute Option Repurchase Price") equal to the amount by which (i) the Highest Closing Price (as hereinafter defined) exceeds (ii) the exercise price of the Substitute Option, multiplied by the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock for which the Substitute Option may then be exercised, and at the request of the owner (the "Substitute Share Owner") of shares of Substitute Common Stock (the "Substitute Shares"), the Substitute Option Issuer shall repurchase the Substitute Shares at a price (the "Substitute Share Repurchase Price") equal to the Highest Closing Price multiplied by the number of Substitute Shares so designated. The term "Highest Closing Price" shall mean the highest closing price for shares of Substitute Common Stock within the six-month period immediately preceding the date the Substitute Option Holder gives notice of the required repurchase of the Substitute Option or the Substitute Share Owner gives notice of the required repurchase of the Substitute Shares, as applicable. (b) The Substitute Option Holder and the Substitute Share Owner, as the case may be, may exercise its respective right to require the Substitute Option Issuer to repurchase the Substitute Option and the Substitute Shares pursuant to this Section 9 by surrendering for such purpose to the Substitute Option Issuer, at its principal office, the agreement for such Substitute Option (or, in the absence of such an agreement, a copy of this Agreement) and certificates for Substitute Shares accompanied by a written notice or notices stating that the Substitute Option Holder or the Substitute Share Owner, as the case may be, elects to require the Substitute Option Issuer to repurchase the Substitute Option and/or the Substitute Shares in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9. As promptly as practicable, and in any event within five business days after the surrender of the Substitute Option and/or certificates representing Substitute Shares and the receipt of such notice or notices relating thereto, the Substitute Option Issuer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Substitute Option Holder the Substitute Option Repurchase Price and/or to the Substitute Share Owner the Substitute Share Repurchase Price therefor or, in either case, the portion thereof which the Substitute Option Issuer is not then prohibited under applicable law and regulation from so delivering. (c) To the extent that the Substitute Option Issuer is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from repurchasing the Substitute Option and/or the Substitute Shares in part or in full, the Substitute Option Issuer following a request for repurchase pursuant to this Section 9 shall immediately so notify the Substitute Option Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner and thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to the Substitute Option Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner, as appropriate, the portion of the Substitute Share Repurchase Price, respectively, which it is no longer prohibited from delivering, within five business days after the date on which the Substitute Option Issuer is no longer so prohibited; provided, however, that if the Substitute Option Issuer is at any time after delivery of a notice of repurchase pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 9 prohibited under applicable law or regulation from delivering to the Substitute Option Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner, as appropriate, the Substitute Option Repurchase Price and the Substitute Share Repurchase Price, respectively, in full (and the Substitute Option Issuer shall use its best efforts to obtain all required regulatory and legal approvals, in each case as promptly as practicable, in order to accomplish such repurchase), the Substitute Option Holder or Substitute Share Owner may revoke its notice of repurchase of the Substitute Option or the Substitute Shares either in whole or to the extent of the prohibition, whereupon, in the latter case, the Substitute Option Issuer shall promptly (i) deliver to the Substitute Option Holder or Substitute Share Owner, as appropriate, that portion of the Substitute Option Repurchase Price or the Substitute Share Repurchase Price that the Substitute Option Issuer is not prohibited from delivering; and (ii) deliver, as appropriate, either (A) to the Substitute Option Holder, a new Substitute Option evidencing the right of the Substitute Option Holder to purchase that number of shares of the Substitute Common Stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of the Substitute Common Stock for which the surrendered Substitute Option was exercisable at the time of delivery of the notice of repurchase by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Substitute Option Repurchase Price less the portion thereof theretofore delivered to the Substitute Option Holder and the denominator of which is the Substitute Option Repurchase Price, or (B) to the Substitute Share Owner, a certificate for the Substitute Common Shares it is then so prohibited from repurchasing. 10. The 90-day or 180-day periods for exercise of certain rights under Sections 2, 6, 7 and 13 shall be extended: (i) to the extent necessary to obtain all regulatory approvals for the exercise of such rights and for the expiration of all statutory waiting periods; and (ii) to the extent necessary to avoid liability under Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act by reason of such exercise. 11. Issuer hereby represents and warrants to Grantee as follows: (a) Issuer has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the Board of Directors of Issuer and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Issuer are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions so contemplated. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Issuer. (b) Issuer has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize and reserve and to permit it to issue, and at all times from the date hereof through the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms will have reserved for issuance upon the exercise of the Option, that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the maximum number of shares of Common Stock at any time and from time to time issuable hereunder, and all such shares, upon issuance pursuant hereto, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable, and will be delivered free and clear of all claims, liens, encumbrance and security interests and not subject to any preemptive rights. (c) Issuer has taken all action (including if required redeeming all of the Rights or amending or terminating the Rights Agreement) so that the entering into of this Option Agreement, the acquisition of shares of Common Stock hereunder and the other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not result in the grant of any rights to any person under the Rights Agreement or enable or require the Rights to be exercised, distributed or triggered. 12. Grantee hereby represents and warrants to Issuer that: (a) Grantee has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and, subject to any approvals or consents referred to herein, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Grantee. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Grantee. (b) The Option is not being, and any shares of Common Stock or other securities acquired by Grantee upon exercise of the Option will not be, acquired with a view to the public distribution thereof and will not be transferred or otherwise disposed of except in a transaction registered or exempt from registration under the 1933 Act. 13. Neither of the parties hereto may assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or the Option created hereunder to any other person, without the express written consent of the other party, except that in the event a Subsequent Triggering Event shall have occurred prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Grantee, subject to the express provisions hereof, may assign in whole or in part its rights and obligations hereunder within 180 days following such Subsequent Triggering Event (or such later period as provided in Section 10); provided, however, that until the date 15 days following the date on which the Federal Reserve Board approves an application by Grantee under the BHCA to acquire the shares of Common Stock subject to the Option, Grantee may not assign its rights under the Option except in (i) a widely dispersed public distribution, (ii) a private placement in which no one party acquires the right to purchase in excess of 2% of the voting shares of Issuer, (iii) an assignment to a single party (e.g., a broker or investment banker) for the purpose of conducting a widely dispersed public distribution on Grantee's behalf, or (iv) any other manner approved by the Federal Reserve Board. 14. Each of Grantee and Issuer will use its best efforts to make all filings with, and to obtain consents of, all third parties and governmental authorities necessary to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without limitation making application to list the shares of Common Stock issuable hereunder on the New York Stock Exchange upon official notice of issuance and applying to the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA for approval to acquire the shares issuable hereunder, but Grantee shall not be obligated to apply to state banking authorities for approval to acquire the shares of Common Stock issuable hereunder until such time, if ever, as it deems appropriate to do so. 15. (a) Grantee may, at any time during which Issuer would be required to repurchase the Option or any Option Shares pursuant to Section 7 upon proper request or notice, surrender the Option (together with any Option Shares issued to and then owned by Grantee) to Issuer in exchange for a cash fee equal to the Surrender Price (as defined below); provided, however, that Grantee may not exercise its rights pursuant to this Section 15 if Issuer has repurchased the Option (or any portion thereof) or any Option Shares pursuant to Section 7. The "Surrender Price" shall be equal to (i) $1.8948 billion, plus (ii) if applicable, the aggregate purchase price previously paid pursuant hereto by Grantee with respect to any Option Shares, minus (iii) if applicable, the sum of (A) the excess of (1) the net cash amounts, if any, received by Grantee pursuant to the arms' length sale of Option Shares (or any other securities into which such Option Shares were converted or exchanged) to any party not affiliated with Grantee, over (2) the aggregate purchase price previously paid pursuant hereto by Grantee with respect to such Option Shares and (B) the net cash amounts, if any, received by Grantee pursuant to an arms' length sale of a portion of the Option to any party not affiliated with Grantee. (b) Grantee may exercise its right to surrender the Option and any Option Shares pursuant to this Section 15 by surrendering to Issuer, at its principal office, this Agreement together with certificates for Option Shares, if any, accompanied by a written notice stating (i) that Grantee elects to surrender the Option and Option Shares, if any, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 15 and (ii) the Surrender Price. The Surrender Price shall be payable in immediately available funds on or before the second business day following receipt of such notice by Issuer. (c) To the extent that Issuer is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from paying the Surrender Price to Grantee in full, Issuer shall immediately so notify Grantee and thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to Grantee, the portion of the Surrender Price that Issuer is no longer prohibited from paying, within five business days after the date on which Issuer is no longer so prohibited, provided, however, that if Issuer at any time after delivery of a notice of surrender pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 15 is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from paying to Grantee the Surrender Price in full (i) Issuer shall (A) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all required regulatory and legal approvals and to file any required notices as promptly as practicable in order to make such payments, (B) within five days of the submission or receipt of any documents relating to any such regulatory and legal approvals, provide Grantee with copies of the same, and (C) keep Grantee advised of both the status of any such request for regulatory and legal approvals, as well as any discussions with any relevant regulatory or other third party reasonably related to the same and (ii) Grantee may revoke such notice of surrender by delivery of a notice of revocation to Issuer and, upon delivery of such notice of revocation, the Exercise Termination Date shall be extended to a date six months from the date on which the Exercise Termination Date would have occurred if not for the provisions of this Section 15(c) (during which period Grantee may exercise any of its rights hereunder, including any and all rights pursuant to this Section 15). (d) Grantee shall have rights substantially identical to those set forth in paragraphs (a),(b) and (c) of this Section 15 with respect to the Substitute Option and the Substitute Option Issuer during any period in which the Substitute Option Issuer would be required to repurchase the Substitute Option pursuant to Section 9. 16. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall the Grantee's Total Profit (as hereinafter defined) exceed $2.3685 billion and, if it otherwise would exceed such amount, the Grantee, at its sole election, shall either (i) reduce the number of shares of Common Stock subject to this Option, (ii) deliver to Issuer for cancellation Option Shares previously purchased by Grantee, (iii) pay cash to Issuer, or (iv) any combination thereof, so that Grantee's actually realized Total Profit shall not exceed $2.3685 billion after taking into account the foregoing actions. (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Option may not be exercised for a number of shares as would, as of the date of exercise, result in a Notional Total Profit (as defined below) of more than $2.3685 billion; provided that nothing in this sentence shall restrict any exercise of the Option permitted hereby on any subsequent date. (c) As used herein, the term "Total Profit" shall mean the aggregate amount (before taxes) of the following: (i) the amount received by Grantee pursuant to Issuer's repurchase of the Option (or any portion thereof) pursuant to Section 7, (ii) (x) the amount received by Grantee pursuant to Issuer's repurchase of Option Shares pursuant to Section 7, less (y) the Grantee's purchase price for such Option Shares, (iii) (x) the net cash amounts received by Grantee pursuant to the sale of Option Shares (or any other securities into which such Option Shares are converted or exchanged) to any unaffiliated party, less (y) the Grantee's purchase price of such Option Shares, (iv) any amounts received by Grantee on the transfer of the Option (or any portion thereof) to any unaffiliated party, and (v) any amount equivalent to the foregoing with respect to the Substitute Option. (d) As used herein, the term "Notional Total Profit" with respect to any number of shares as to which Grantee may propose to exercise this Option shall be the Total Profit determined as of the date of such proposed exercise assuming that this Option were exercised on such date for such number of shares and assuming that such shares, together with all other Option Shares held by Grantee and its affiliates as of such date, were sold for cash at the closing market price for the Common Stock as of the close of business on the preceding trading day (less customary brokerage commissions). 17. The parties hereto acknowledge that damages would be an inadequate remedy for a breach of this Agreement by either party hereto and that the obligations of the parties hereto shall be enforceable by either party hereto through injunctive or other equitable relief. 18. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is held by a court or a federal or state regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions and covenants and restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. If for any reason such court or regulatory agency determines that the Holder is not permitted to acquire, or Issuer is not permitted to repurchase pursuant to Section 7, the full number of shares of Common Stock provided in Section 1(a) hereof (as adjusted pursuant to Section 1(b) or 5 hereof), it is the express intention of Issuer to allow the Holder to acquire or to require Issuer to repurchase such lesser number of shares as may be permissible, without any amendment or modification hereof. 19. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications hereunder shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered in person, by cable, telegram, telecopy or telex, or by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested) at the respective addresses of the parties set forth in the Merger Agreement. 20. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof (except to the extent that mandatory provisions of federal or state law apply). 21. This Agreement may be executed in two counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. 22. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each of the parties hereto shall bear and pay all costs and expenses incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, including fees and expenses of its own financial consultants, investment bankers, accountants and counsel. 23. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in the Merger Agreement, this Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder and supersedes all prior arrangements or understandings with respect thereof, written or oral. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any party, other than the parties hereto, and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except as expressly provided herein. 24. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Merger Agreement.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties has caused this Agreement to be executed on its behalf by its officers thereunto duly authorized, all as of the date first above written.

Exhibit 99.3 ------------ THE TRANSFER OF THIS AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS CONTAINED HEREIN AND TO RESALE RESTRICTIONS UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT, dated October 27, 2003, between Bank of America Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Issuer"), and FleetBoston Financial Corporation, a Rhode Island corporation ("Grantee"). W I T N E S S E T H: - - - - - - - - - - WHEREAS, Grantee and Issuer have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger of even date herewith (the "Merger Agreement"), which agreement has been executed by the parties hereto in connection with this Stock Option Agreement (the "Agreement"); and WHEREAS, as a condition to Grantee's entering into the Merger Agreement and in consideration therefor, Issuer has agreed to grant Grantee the Option (as hereinafter defined); NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein and in the Merger Agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows: 1. (a) Issuer hereby grants to Grantee an unconditional, irrevocable option (the "Option") to purchase, subject to the terms hereof, up to 297,374,945 fully paid and nonassessable shares of Issuer's Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Common Stock"), at a price of $81.86 per share (the "Option Price"); provided, however, that in no event shall the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Option is exercisable exceed 19.9% of the Issuer's issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock without giving effect to any shares subject to or issued pursuant to the Option. The number of shares of Common Stock that may be received upon the exercise of the Option and the Option Price are subject to adjustment as herein set forth. (b) In the event that any additional shares of Common Stock are either (i) issued or otherwise become outstanding after the date of this Agreement (other than pursuant to this Agreement) or (ii) redeemed, repurchased, retired or otherwise cease to be outstanding after the date of this Agreement, the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Option shall be increased or decreased, as appropriate, so that, after such issuance, such number equals 19.9% of the number of shares of Common Stock then issued and outstanding without giving effect to any shares subject or issued pursuant to the Option. Nothing contained in this Section 1(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to authorize Issuer or Grantee to breach any provision of the Merger Agreement. 2. (a) The Holder (as hereinafter defined) may exercise the Option, in whole or part, and from time to time, if, but only if, both an Initial Triggering Event (as hereinafter defined) and a Subsequent Triggering Event (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred prior to the occurrence of an Exercise Termination Event (as hereinafter defined), provided that the Holder shall have sent the written notice of such exercise (as provided in subsection (e) of this Section 2) within 180 days following such Subsequent Triggering Event. Each of the following shall be an "Exercise Termination Event": (i) the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of the Merger; (ii) termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with the provisions thereof if such termination occurs prior to the occurrence of an Initial Triggering Event except a termination by Grantee pursuant to Section 8.1(d) of the Merger Agreement (unless the breach by Issuer giving rise to such right of termination is non-volitional); or (iii) the passage of 18 months after termination of the Merger Agreement if such termination follows the occurrence of an Initial Triggering Event or is a termination by Grantee pursuant to Section 8.1(d) of the Merger Agreement (unless the breach by Issuer giving rise to such right of termination is non-volitional). The term "Holder" shall mean the holder or holders of the Option. (b) The term "Initial Triggering Event" shall mean any of the following events or transactions occurring after the date hereof: (i) Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries (each an "Issuer Subsidiary"), without having received Grantee's prior written consent, shall have entered into an agreement to engage in an Acquisition Transaction (as hereinafter defined) with any person (the term "person" for purposes of this Agreement having the meaning assigned thereto in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), and the rules and regulations thereunder) other than Grantee or any of its Subsidiaries (each a "Grantee Subsidiary") or the Board of Directors of Issuer shall have recommended that the stockholders of Issuer approve or accept any Acquisition Transaction with any person other than Grantee or a Subsidiary of Grantee. For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean (w) a merger, consolidation or share exchange, or any similar transaction, involving Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")) of Issuer, (x) a purchase, lease or other acquisition or assumption of all or a substantial portion of the assets or deposits of Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary of Issuer, (y) a purchase or other acquisition (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise) of securities representing 10% or more of the voting power of Issuer, or (z) any substantially similar transaction; provided, however, that in no event shall any merger, consolidation, purchase or similar transaction involving only the Issuer and one or more of its Subsidiaries or involving only any two or more of such Subsidiaries, be deemed to be an Acquisition Transaction, provided that any such transaction is not entered into in violation of the terms of the Merger Agreement; and, provided further, that in no event shall any merger, consolidation, share exchange or similar transaction in which the shareholders of B, as such, shall in the aggregate own at least 60% of the voting common shares (or equivalents) of the surviving or acquiring entity immediately following the consummation of such transaction be deemed to be an Acquisition Transaction.; (ii) Issuer or any Issuer Subsidiary, without having received Grantee's prior written consent, shall have authorized, recommended, proposed or publicly announced its intention to authorize, recommend or propose, to engage in an Acquisition Transaction with any person other than Grantee or a Grantee Subsidiary, or the Board of Directors of Issuer shall have publicly withdrawn or modified, or publicly announced its intention to withdraw or modify, in any manner adverse to Grantee, its recommendation that the stockholders of Issuer approve the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (iii) Any person other than Grantee, any Grantee Subsidiary or any Issuer Subsidiary acting in a fiduciary capacity in the ordinary course of its business shall have acquired beneficial ownership or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (the term "beneficial ownership" for purposes of this Agreement having the meaning assigned thereto in Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder); (iv) Any person other than Grantee or any Grantee Subsidiary shall have made a bona fide proposal to Issuer or its stockholders by public announcement or written communication that is or becomes the subject of public disclosure to engage in an Acquisition Transaction; (v) After an overture is made by a third party to Issuer or its stockholders to engage in an Acquisition Transaction, Issuer shall have breached any covenant or obligation contained in the Merger Agreement and such breach (x) would entitle Grantee to terminate the Merger Agreement and (y) shall not have been cured prior to the Notice Date (as defined below); or (vi) Any person other than Grantee or any Grantee Subsidiary, other than in connection with a transaction to which Grantee has given its prior written consent, shall have filed an application or notice with the Federal Reserve Board, or other federal or state bank regulatory authority, which application or notice has been accepted for processing, for approval to engage in an Acquisition Transaction. (c) The term "Subsequent Triggering Event" shall mean either of the following events or transactions occurring after the date hereof: (i) The acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the then outstanding Common Stock; or (ii) The occurrence of the Initial Triggering Event described in paragraph (i) of subsection (b) of this Section 2, except that the percentage referred to in clause (y) shall be 20%. (d) Issuer shall notify Grantee promptly in writing of the occurrence of any Initial Triggering Event or Subsequent Triggering Event of which it has knowledge (together, a "Triggering Event"), it being understood that the giving of such notice by Issuer shall not be a condition to the right of the Holder to exercise the Option. (e) In the event the Holder is entitled to and wishes to exercise the Option, it shall send to Issuer a written notice (the date of which being herein referred to as the "Notice Date") specifying (i) the total number of shares it will purchase pursuant to such exercise and (ii) a place and date not earlier than three business days nor later than 60 business days from the Notice Date for the closing of such purchase (the "Closing Date"); provided that if prior notification to or approval of the Federal Reserve Board or any other regulatory agency is required in connection with such purchase, the Holder shall as soon as reasonably practicable file the required notice or application for approval and shall expeditiously process the same and the period of time that otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence shall run instead from the date on which any required notification periods have expired or been terminated or such approvals have been obtained and any requisite waiting period or periods shall have passed. Any exercise of the Option shall be deemed to occur on the Notice Date relating thereto. (f) At the closing referred to in subsection (e) of this Section 2, the Holder shall pay to Issuer the aggregate purchase price for the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to the exercise of the Option in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated by Issuer, provided that failure or refusal of Issuer to designate such a bank account shall not preclude the Holder from exercising the Option. (g) At such closing, simultaneously with the delivery of immediately available funds as provided in subsection (f) of this Section 2, Issuer shall deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of Common Stock purchased by the Holder and, if the Option should be exercised in part only, a new Option evidencing the rights of the Holder thereof to purchase the balance of the shares purchasable hereunder, and the Holder shall deliver to Issuer this Agreement and a letter agreeing that the Holder will not offer to sell or otherwise dispose of such shares in violation of applicable law or the provisions of this Agreement. (h) Certificates for Common Stock delivered at a closing hereunder may be endorsed with a restrictive legend that shall read substantially as follows: "The transfer of the shares represented by this certificate is subject to certain provisions of an agreement between the registered holder hereof and Issuer and to resale restrictions arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. A copy of such agreement is on file at the principal office of Issuer and will be provided to the holder hereof without charge upon receipt by Issuer of a written request therefor." It is understood and agreed that: (i) the reference to the resale restrictions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the Holder shall have delivered to Issuer a copy of a letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Issuer, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the 1933 Act; (ii) the reference to the provisions to this Agreement in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the shares have been sold or transferred in compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and under circumstances that do not require the retention of such reference; and (iii) the legend shall be removed in its entirety if the conditions in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) are both satisfied. In addition, such certificates shall bear any other legend as may be required by law. (i) Upon the giving by the Holder to Issuer of the written notice of exercise of the Option provided for under subsection (e) of this Section 2 and the tender of the applicable purchase price in immediately available funds, the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of Issuer shall then be closed or that certificates representing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to the Holder. Issuer shall pay all expenses, and any and all United States federal, state and local taxes and other charges that may be payable in connection with the preparation, issue and delivery of stock certificates under this Section 2 in the name of the Holder or its assignee, transferee or designee. 3. Issuer agrees: (i) that it shall at all times maintain, free from preemptive rights, sufficient authorized but unissued or treasury shares of Common Stock so that the Option may be exercised without additional authorization of Common Stock after giving effect to all other options, warrants, convertible securities and other rights to purchase Common Stock; (ii) that it will not, by charter amendment or through reorganization, consolidation, merger, dissolution or sale of assets, or by any other voluntary act, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the covenants, stipulations or conditions to be observed or performed hereunder by Issuer; (iii) promptly to take all action as may from time to time be required (including (x) complying with all premerger notification, reporting and waiting period requirements specified in 15 U.S.C. 18a and regulations promulgated thereunder and (y) in the event, under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA"), or the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, or any state banking law, prior approval of or notice to the Federal Reserve Board or to any state or other regulatory authority is necessary before the Option may be exercised, cooperating fully with the Holder in preparing such applications or notices and providing such information to the Federal Reserve Board or such other regulatory authority as they may require) in order to permit the Holder to exercise the Option and Issuer duly and effectively to issue shares of Common Stock pursuant hereto; and (iv) promptly to take all action provided herein to protect the rights of the Holder against dilution. 4. This Agreement (and the Option granted hereby) are exchangeable, without expense, at the option of the Holder, upon presentation and surrender of this Agreement at the principal office of Issuer, for other Agreements providing for Options of different denominations entitling the holder thereof to purchase, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as are set forth herein, in the aggregate the same number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder. The terms "Agreement" and "Option" as used herein include any Stock Option Agreements and related Options for which this Agreement (and the Option granted hereby) may be exchanged. Upon receipt by Issuer of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Agreement, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) of reasonably satisfactory indemnification, and upon surrender and cancellation of this Agreement, if mutilated, Issuer will execute and deliver a new Agreement of like tenor and date. Any such new Agreement executed and delivered shall constitute an additional contractual obligation on the part of Issuer, whether or not the Agreement so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated shall at any time be enforceable by anyone. 5. In addition to the adjustment in the number of shares of Common Stock that are purchasable upon exercise of the Option pursuant to Section 1 of this Agreement, the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the Option and the Option Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 5. In the event of any change in, or distributions in respect of, the Common Stock by reason of stock dividends, split-ups, mergers, recapitalizations, combinations, subdivisions, conversions, exchanges of shares, distributions on or in respect of the Common Stock that would be prohibited under the terms of the Merger Agreement, or the like, the type and number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon exercise hereof and the Option Price shall be appropriately adjusted in such manner as shall fully preserve the economic benefits provided hereunder and proper provision shall be made in any agreement governing any such transaction to provide for such proper adjustment and the full satisfaction of the Issuer's obligations hereunder. 6. Upon the occurrence of a Subsequent Triggering Event that occurs prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer shall, at the request of Grantee delivered within 180 days of such Subsequent Triggering Event (whether on its own behalf or on behalf of any subsequent holder of this Option (or part thereof) or any of the shares of Common Stock issued pursuant hereto), promptly prepare, file and keep current a shelf registration statement under the 1933 Act covering this Option and any shares issued and issuable pursuant to this Option and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective and remain current in order to permit the sale or other disposition of this Option and any shares of Common Stock issued upon total or partial exercise of this Option ("Option Shares") in accordance with any plan of disposition requested by Grantee. Issuer will use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement first to become effective and then to remain effective for such period not in excess of 180 days from the day such registration statement first becomes effective or such shorter time as may be reasonably necessary to effect such sales or other dispositions. Grantee shall have the right to demand two such registrations. The foregoing notwithstanding, if, at the time of any request by Grantee for registration of the Option or Option Shares as provided above, Issuer is in registration with respect to an underwritten public offering of shares of Common Stock, and if in the good faith judgment of the managing underwriter or managing underwriters, or, if none, the sole underwriter or underwriters, of such offering the inclusion of the Holder's Option or Option Shares would interfere with the successful marketing of the shares of Common Stock offered by Issuer, the number of Option Shares otherwise to be covered in the registration statement contemplated hereby may be reduced; provided, however, that after any such required reduction the number of Option Shares to be included in such offering for the account of the Holder shall constitute at least 25% of the total number of shares to be sold by the Holder and Issuer in the aggregate; and provided further, however, that if such reduction occurs, then the Issuer shall file a registration statement for the balance as promptly as practicable and no reduction shall thereafter occur. Each such Holder shall provide all information reasonably requested by Issuer for inclusion in any registration statement to be filed hereunder. If requested by any such Holder in connection with such registration, Issuer shall become a party to any underwriting agreement relating to the sale of such shares, but only to the extent of obligating itself in respect of representations, warranties, indemnities and other agreements customarily included in secondary offering underwriting agreements for the Issuer. Upon receiving any request under this Section 6 from any Holder, Issuer agrees to send a copy thereof to any other person known to Issuer to be entitled to registration rights under this Section 6, in each case by promptly mailing the same, postage prepaid, to the address of record of the persons entitled to receive such copies. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall Issuer be obligated to effect more than two registrations pursuant to this Section 6 by reason of the fact that there shall be more than one Grantee as a result of any assignment or division of this Agreement. 7. (a) Immediately prior to the occurrence of a Repurchase Event (as defined below), (i) following a request of the Holder, delivered prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer (or any successor thereto) shall repurchase the Option from the Holder at a price (the "Option Repurchase Price") equal to the number of shares for which this Option may then be exercised multiplied by the amount by which (A) the Market/Offer Price (as defined below) exceeds (B) the Option Price, and (ii) at the request of the owner of Option Shares from time to time (the "Owner"), delivered within 90 days of such occurrence (or such later period as provided in Section 10), Issuer shall repurchase such number of the Option Shares from the Owner as the Owner shall designate at a price (the "Option Share Repurchase Price") equal to the Market/Offer Price multiplied by the number of Option Shares so designated. The term "Market/Offer Price" shall mean the highest of (i) the price per share of Common Stock at which a tender offer or exchange offer therefor has been made, (ii) the price per share of Common Stock to be paid by any third party pursuant to an agreement with Issuer, (iii) the highest closing price for shares of Common Stock within the six-month period immediately preceding the date the Holder gives notice of the required repurchase of this Option or the Owner gives notice of the required repurchase of Option Shares, as the case may be, or (iv) in the event of a sale of all or a substantial portion of Issuer's assets, the sum of the price paid in such sale for such assets and the current market value of the remaining assets of Issuer as determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or the Owner, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the Issuer, divided by the number of shares of Common Stock of Issuer outstanding at the time of such sale. In determining the Market/Offer Price, the value of consideration other than cash shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or Owner, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the Issuer. (b) The Holder and the Owner, as the case may be, may exercise its right to require Issuer to repurchase the Option and any Option Shares pursuant to this Section 7 by surrendering for such purpose to Issuer, at its principal office, this Agreement or certificates for Option Shares, as applicable, accompanied by a written notice or notices stating that the Holder or the Owner, as the case may be, elects to require Issuer to repurchase this Option and/or the Option Shares in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7. Within the latter to occur of (x) five business days after the surrender of the Option and/or certificates representing Option Shares and the receipt of such notice or notices relating thereto and (y) the time that is immediately prior to the occurrence of a Repurchase Event, Issuer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Holder the Option Repurchase Price and/or to the Owner the Option Share Repurchase Price therefor or the portion thereof, if any, that Issuer is not then prohibited under applicable law and regulation from so delivering. (c) To the extent that Issuer is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from repurchasing the Option and/or the Option Shares in full, Issuer shall immediately so notify the Holder and/or the Owner and thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, the portion of the Option Repurchase Price and the Option Share Repurchase Price, respectively, that it is no longer prohibited from delivering, within five business days after the date on which Issuer is no longer so prohibited; provided, however, that if Issuer at any time after delivery of a notice of repurchase pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 7 is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from delivering to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, the Option Repurchase Price and the Option Share Repurchase Price, respectively, in full (and Issuer hereby undertakes to use its best efforts to obtain all required regulatory and legal approvals and to file any required notices, in each case as promptly as practicable in order to accomplish such repurchase), the Holder or Owner may revoke its notice of repurchase of the Option or the Option Shares either in whole or to the extent of the prohibition, whereupon, in the latter case, Issuer shall promptly (i) deliver to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, that portion of the Option Repurchase Price or the Option Share Repurchase Price that Issuer is not prohibited from delivering; and (ii) deliver, as appropriate, either (A) to the Holder, a new Stock Option Agreement evidencing the right of the Holder to purchase that number of shares of Common Stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock for which the surrendered Stock Option Agreement was exercisable at the time of delivery of the notice of repurchase by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Option Repurchase Price less the portion thereof theretofore delivered to the Holder and the denominator of which is the Option Repurchase Price, or (B) to the Owner, a certificate for the Option Shares it is then so prohibited from repurchasing. (d) For purposes of this Section 7, a Repurchase Event shall be deemed to have occurred (i) upon the consummation of any merger, consolidation, share exchange or similar transaction involving Issuer or any purchase, lease or other acquisition of all or a substantial portion of the assets of Issuer, other than any such transaction which would not constitute an Acquisition Transaction pursuant to the provisos to Section 2(b)(i) hereof or (ii) upon the acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock, provided that no such event shall constitute a Repurchase Event unless a Subsequent Triggering Event shall have occurred prior to an Exercise Termination Event. The parties hereto agree that Issuer's obligations to repurchase the Option or Option Shares under this Section 7 shall not terminate upon the occurrence of an Exercise Termination Event unless no Subsequent Triggering Event shall have occurred prior to the occurrence of an Exercise Termination Event. 8. (a) In the event that prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer shall enter into an agreement (i) to consolidate with or merge into any person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, to merge into Issuer and Issuer shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other person or cash or any other property or the then outstanding shares of Common Stock shall after such merger represent less than 50% of the outstanding voting shares and voting share equivalents of the merged company, or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, then, and in each such case, the agreement governing such transaction shall make proper provision so that the Option shall, upon the consummation of any such transaction and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, be converted into, or exchanged for, an option (the "Substitute Option"), at the election of the Holder, of either (x) the Acquiring Corporation (as hereinafter defined) or (y) any person that controls the Acquiring Corporation. (b) The following terms have the meanings indicated: (A) "Acquiring Corporation" shall mean (i) the continuing or surviving corporation of a consolidation or merger with Issuer (if other than Issuer), (ii) Issuer in a merger in which Issuer is the continuing or surviving person, and (iii) the transferee of all or substantially all of Issuer's assets. (B) "Substitute Common Stock" shall mean the common stock issued by the issuer of the Substitute Option upon exercise of the Substitute Option. (C) "Assigned Value" shall mean the Market/Offer Price, as defined in Section 7. (D) "Average Price" shall mean the average closing price of a share of the Substitute Common Stock for the one year immediately preceding the consolidation, merger or sale in question, but in no event higher than the closing price of the shares of Substitute Common Stock on the day preceding such consolidation, merger or sale; provided that if Issuer is the issuer of the Substitute Option, the Average Price shall be computed with respect to a share of common stock issued by the person merging into Issuer or by any company which controls or is controlled by such person, as the Holder may elect. (c) The Substitute Option shall have the same terms as the Option, provided, that if the terms of the Substitute Option cannot, for legal reasons, be the same as the Option, such terms shall be as similar as possible and in no event less advantageous to the Holder. The issuer of the Substitute Option shall also enter into an agreement with the then Holder or Holders of the Substitute Option in substantially the same form as this Agreement, which shall be applicable to the Substitute Option. (d) The Substitute Option shall be exercisable for such number of shares of Substitute Common Stock as is equal to the Assigned Value multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock for which the Option is then exercisable, divided by the Average Price. The exercise price of the Substitute Option per share of Substitute Common Stock shall then be equal to the Option Price multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock for which the Option is then exercisable and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock for which the Substitute Option is exercisable. (e) In no event, pursuant to any of the foregoing paragraphs, shall the Substitute Option be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the shares of Substitute Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise of the Substitute Option. In the event that the Substitute Option would be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the shares of Substitute Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise but for this clause (e), the issuer of the Substitute Option (the "Substitute Option Issuer") shall make a cash payment to Holder equal to the excess of (i) the value of the Substitute Option without giving effect to the limitation in this clause (e) over (ii) the value of the Substitute Option after giving effect to the limitation in this clause (e). This difference in value shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or the Owner, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the Acquiring Corporation. (f) Issuer shall not enter into any transaction described in subsection (a) of this Section 8 unless the Acquiring Corporation and any person that controls the Acquiring Corporation assume in writing all the obligations of Issuer hereunder. 9. (a) At the request of the holder of the Substitute Option (the "Substitute Option Holder"), the Substitute Option Issuer shall repurchase the Substitute Option from the Substitute Option Holder at a price (the "Substitute Option Repurchase Price") equal to the amount by which (i) the Highest Closing Price (as hereinafter defined) exceeds (ii) the exercise price of the Substitute Option, multiplied by the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock for which the Substitute Option may then be exercised, and at the request of the owner (the "Substitute Share Owner") of shares of Substitute Common Stock (the "Substitute Shares"), the Substitute Option Issuer shall repurchase the Substitute Shares at a price (the "Substitute Share Repurchase Price") equal to the Highest Closing Price multiplied by the number of Substitute Shares so designated. The term "Highest Closing Price" shall mean the highest closing price for shares of Substitute Common Stock within the six-month period immediately preceding the date the Substitute Option Holder gives notice of the required repurchase of the Substitute Option or the Substitute Share Owner gives notice of the required repurchase of the Substitute Shares, as applicable. (b) The Substitute Option Holder and the Substitute Share Owner, as the case may be, may exercise its respective right to require the Substitute Option Issuer to repurchase the Substitute Option and the Substitute Shares pursuant to this Section 9 by surrendering for such purpose to the Substitute Option Issuer, at its principal office, the agreement for such Substitute Option (or, in the absence of such an agreement, a copy of this Agreement) and certificates for Substitute Shares accompanied by a written notice or notices stating that the Substitute Option Holder or the Substitute Share Owner, as the case may be, elects to require the Substitute Option Issuer to repurchase the Substitute Option and/or the Substitute Shares in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9. As promptly as practicable, and in any event within five business days after the surrender of the Substitute Option and/or certificates representing Substitute Shares and the receipt of such notice or notices relating thereto, the Substitute Option Issuer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Substitute Option Holder the Substitute Option Repurchase Price and/or to the Substitute Share Owner the Substitute Share Repurchase Price therefor or, in either case, the portion thereof which the Substitute Option Issuer is not then prohibited under applicable law and regulation from so delivering. (c) To the extent that the Substitute Option Issuer is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from repurchasing the Substitute Option and/or the Substitute Shares in part or in full, the Substitute Option Issuer following a request for repurchase pursuant to this Section 9 shall immediately so notify the Substitute Option Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner and thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to the Substitute Option Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner, as appropriate, the portion of the Substitute Share Repurchase Price, respectively, which it is no longer prohibited from delivering, within five business days after the date on which the Substitute Option Issuer is no longer so prohibited; provided, however, that if the Substitute Option Issuer is at any time after delivery of a notice of repurchase pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 9 prohibited under applicable law or regulation from delivering to the Substitute Option Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner, as appropriate, the Substitute Option Repurchase Price and the Substitute Share Repurchase Price, respectively, in full (and the Substitute Option Issuer shall use its best efforts to obtain all required regulatory and legal approvals, in each case as promptly as practicable, in order to accomplish such repurchase), the Substitute Option Holder or Substitute Share Owner may revoke its notice of repurchase of the Substitute Option or the Substitute Shares either in whole or to the extent of the prohibition, whereupon, in the latter case, the Substitute Option Issuer shall promptly (i) deliver to the Substitute Option Holder or Substitute Share Owner, as appropriate, that portion of the Substitute Option Repurchase Price or the Substitute Share Repurchase Price that the Substitute Option Issuer is not prohibited from delivering; and (ii) deliver, as appropriate, either (A) to the Substitute Option Holder, a new Substitute Option evidencing the right of the Substitute Option Holder to purchase that number of shares of the Substitute Common Stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of the Substitute Common Stock for which the surrendered Substitute Option was exercisable at the time of delivery of the notice of repurchase by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Substitute Option Repurchase Price less the portion thereof theretofore delivered to the Substitute Option Holder and the denominator of which is the Substitute Option Repurchase Price, or (B) to the Substitute Share Owner, a certificate for the Substitute Common Shares it is then so prohibited from repurchasing. 10. The 90-day or 180-day periods for exercise of certain rights under Sections 2, 6, 7 and 13 shall be extended: (i) to the extent necessary to obtain all regulatory approvals for the exercise of such rights and for the expiration of all statutory waiting periods; and (ii) to the extent necessary to avoid liability under Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act by reason of such exercise. 11. Issuer hereby represents and warrants to Grantee as follows: (a) Issuer has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the Board of Directors of Issuer and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Issuer are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions so contemplated. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Issuer. (b) Issuer has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize and reserve and to permit it to issue, and at all times from the date hereof through the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms will have reserved for issuance upon the exercise of the Option, that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the maximum number of shares of Common Stock at any time and from time to time issuable hereunder, and all such shares, upon issuance pursuant hereto, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable, and will be delivered free and clear of all claims, liens, encumbrance and security interests and not subject to any preemptive rights. (c) Issuer has taken all action (including if required redeeming all of the Rights or amending or terminating the Rights Agreement) so that the entering into of this Option Agreement, the acquisition of shares of Common Stock hereunder and the other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not result in the grant of any rights to any person under the Rights Agreement or enable or require the Rights to be exercised, distributed or triggered. 12. Grantee hereby represents and warrants to Issuer that: (a) Grantee has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and, subject to any approvals or consents referred to herein, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Grantee. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Grantee. (b) The Option is not being, and any shares of Common Stock or other securities acquired by Grantee upon exercise of the Option will not be, acquired with a view to the public distribution thereof and will not be transferred or otherwise disposed of except in a transaction registered or exempt from registration under the 1933 Act. 13. Neither of the parties hereto may assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or the Option created hereunder to any other person, without the express written consent of the other party, except that in the event a Subsequent Triggering Event shall have occurred prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Grantee, subject to the express provisions hereof, may assign in whole or in part its rights and obligations hereunder within 180 days following such Subsequent Triggering Event (or such later period as provided in Section 10); provided, however, that until the date 15 days following the date on which the Federal Reserve Board approves an application by Grantee under the BHCA to acquire the shares of Common Stock subject to the Option, Grantee may not assign its rights under the Option except in (i) a widely dispersed public distribution, (ii) a private placement in which no one party acquires the right to purchase in excess of 2% of the voting shares of Issuer, (iii) an assignment to a single party (e.g., a broker or investment banker) for the purpose of conducting a widely dispersed public distribution on Grantee's behalf, or (iv) any other manner approved by the Federal Reserve Board. 14. Each of Grantee and Issuer will use its best efforts to make all filings with, and to obtain consents of, all third parties and governmental authorities necessary to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without limitation making application to list the shares of Common Stock issuable hereunder on the New York Stock Exchange upon official notice of issuance and applying to the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA for approval to acquire the shares issuable hereunder, but Grantee shall not be obligated to apply to state banking authorities for approval to acquire the shares of Common Stock issuable hereunder until such time, if ever, as it deems appropriate to do so. 15. (a) Grantee may, at any time during which Issuer would be required to repurchase the Option or any Option Shares pursuant to Section 7 upon proper request or notice, surrender the Option (together with any Option Shares issued to and then owned by Grantee) to Issuer in exchange for a cash fee equal to the Surrender Price (as defined below); provided, however, that Grantee may not exercise its rights pursuant to this Section 15 if Issuer has repurchased the Option (or any portion thereof) or any Option Shares pursuant to Section 7. The "Surrender Price" shall be equal to (i) $1.8948 billion, plus (ii) if applicable, the aggregate purchase price previously paid pursuant hereto by Grantee with respect to any Option Shares, minus (iii) if applicable, the sum of (A) the excess of (1) the net cash amounts, if any, received by Grantee pursuant to the arms' length sale of Option Shares (or any other securities into which such Option Shares were converted or exchanged) to any party not affiliated with Grantee, over (2) the aggregate purchase price previously paid pursuant hereto by Grantee with respect to such Option Shares and (B) the net cash amounts, if any, received by Grantee pursuant to an arms' length sale of a portion of the Option to any party not affiliated with Grantee. (b) Grantee may exercise its right to surrender the Option and any Option Shares pursuant to this Section 15 by surrendering to Issuer, at its principal office, this Agreement together with certificates for Option Shares, if any, accompanied by a written notice stating (i) that Grantee elects to surrender the Option and Option Shares, if any, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 15 and (ii) the Surrender Price. The Surrender Price shall be payable in immediately available funds on or before the second business day following receipt of such notice by Issuer. (c) To the extent that Issuer is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from paying the Surrender Price to Grantee in full, Issuer shall immediately so notify Grantee and thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to Grantee, the portion of the Surrender Price that Issuer is no longer prohibited from paying, within five business days after the date on which Issuer is no longer so prohibited, provided, however, that if Issuer at any time after delivery of a notice of surrender pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 15 is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from paying to Grantee the Surrender Price in full (i) Issuer shall (A) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all required regulatory and legal approvals and to file any required notices as promptly as practicable in order to make such payments, (B) within five days of the submission or receipt of any documents relating to any such regulatory and legal approvals, provide Grantee with copies of the same, and (C) keep Grantee advised of both the status of any such request for regulatory and legal approvals, as well as any discussions with any relevant regulatory or other third party reasonably related to the same and (ii) Grantee may revoke such notice of surrender by delivery of a notice of revocation to Issuer and, upon delivery of such notice of revocation, the Exercise Termination Date shall be extended to a date six months from the date on which the Exercise Termination Date would have occurred if not for the provisions of this Section 15(c) (during which period Grantee may exercise any of its rights hereunder, including any and all rights pursuant to this Section 15). (d) Grantee shall have rights substantially identical to those set forth in paragraphs (a),(b) and (c) of this Section 15 with respect to the Substitute Option and the Substitute Option Issuer during any period in which the Substitute Option Issuer would be required to repurchase the Substitute Option pursuant to Section 9. 16. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall the Grantee's Total Profit (as hereinafter defined) exceed $2.3685 billion and, if it otherwise would exceed such amount, the Grantee, at its sole election, shall either (i) reduce the number of shares of Common Stock subject to this Option, (ii) deliver to Issuer for cancellation Option Shares previously purchased by Grantee, (iii) pay cash to Issuer, or (iv) any combination thereof, so that Grantee's actually realized Total Profit shall not exceed $2.3685 billion after taking into account the foregoing actions. (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Option may not be exercised for a number of shares as would, as of the date of exercise, result in a Notional Total Profit (as defined below) of more than $2.3685 billion; provided that nothing in this sentence shall restrict any exercise of the Option permitted hereby on any subsequent date. (c) As used herein, the term "Total Profit" shall mean the aggregate amount (before taxes) of the following: (i) the amount received by Grantee pursuant to Issuer's repurchase of the Option (or any portion thereof) pursuant to Section 7, (ii) (x) the amount received by Grantee pursuant to Issuer's repurchase of Option Shares pursuant to Section 7, less (y) the Grantee's purchase price for such Option Shares, (iii) (x) the net cash amounts received by Grantee pursuant to the sale of Option Shares (or any other securities into which such Option Shares are converted or exchanged) to any unaffiliated party, less (y) the Grantee's purchase price of such Option Shares, (iv) any amounts received by Grantee on the transfer of the Option (or any portion thereof) to any unaffiliated party, and (v) any amount equivalent to the foregoing with respect to the Substitute Option. (d) As used herein, the term "Notional Total Profit" with respect to any number of shares as to which Grantee may propose to exercise this Option shall be the Total Profit determined as of the date of such proposed exercise assuming that this Option were exercised on such date for such number of shares and assuming that such shares, together with all other Option Shares held by Grantee and its affiliates as of such date, were sold for cash at the closing market price for the Common Stock as of the close of business on the preceding trading day (less customary brokerage commissions). 17. The parties hereto acknowledge that damages would be an inadequate remedy for a breach of this Agreement by either party hereto and that the obligations of the parties hereto shall be enforceable by either party hereto through injunctive or other equitable relief. 18. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is held by a court or a federal or state regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions and covenants and restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. If for any reason such court or regulatory agency determines that the Holder is not permitted to acquire, or Issuer is not permitted to repurchase pursuant to Section 7, the full number of shares of Common Stock provided in Section 1(a) hereof (as adjusted pursuant to Section 1(b) or 5 hereof), it is the express intention of Issuer to allow the Holder to acquire or to require Issuer to repurchase such lesser number of shares as may be permissible, without any amendment or modification hereof. 19. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications hereunder shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered in person, by cable, telegram, telecopy or telex, or by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested) at the respective addresses of the parties set forth in the Merger Agreement. 20. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof (except to the extent that mandatory provisions of federal or state law apply). 21. This Agreement may be executed in two counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. 22. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each of the parties hereto shall bear and pay all costs and expenses incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, including fees and expenses of its own financial consultants, investment bankers, accountants and counsel. 23. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in the Merger Agreement, this Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder and supersedes all prior arrangements or understandings with respect thereof, written or oral. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any party, other than the parties hereto, and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except as expressly provided herein. 24. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Merger Agreement.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties has caused this Agreement to be executed on its behalf by its officers thereunto duly authorized, all as of the date first above written.
