ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS AND REQUIRED FD DISCLOSURE.
 
On March 18, 2004, Bank of America's counsel in Italy was informed by the Public Prosecutor's Office for the Court of Milan, Italy that a request had been filed with the Court of Milan for an accelerated trial with respect to Bank of America for administrative liability arising out of the actions of former employees who allegedly committed illegal acts. Bank of America was also informed that three of its former employees Antonio Luzi, Luis Moncada and Luca Sala were also the subject of a request for accelerated trial. The Corporation has not received written notice of such charges.
 
The Corporation does not believe that the proposed charges against it are supported by the facts, and will defend such charges vigorously.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
