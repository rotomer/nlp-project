Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein, and subject to the reservation by the Corporation of the right to sell Notes directly on its own behalf, the Corporation hereby appoints each of you as Agent in connection with the offer and sale of the Notes. The Corporation reserves the right to sell Notes, at any time, on its own behalf to any unsolicited purchaser, whether directly to such purchaser or through an agent for such purchaser. Upon the sale of any Notes to an unsolicited purchaser, no Agent named herein shall be entitled to any commission pursuant to this Agreement.
Appointment
           (b) . Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Agent agrees, as agent of the Corporation, to use its reasonable best efforts when requested by the Corporation to solicit offers to purchase the Notes upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus and the administrative procedures with respect to the sale of Notes as may be agreed upon from time to time between the Agents and the Corporation (the "Procedures").

Agent shall have the right, in its discretion reasonably exercised, to reject any proposed purchase of Notes, in whole or in part, by persons solicited by the Agent and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach of the Agent's agreement contained herein.

        All Notes sold through an Agent, as agent, will be sold at 100% of their principal amount unless otherwise agreed to by the Corporation and such Agent.

Unless otherwise agreed between the Corporation and the Agent and, if required by law or otherwise, disclosed in a Pricing Supplement, each Note sold to an Agent as principal shall be purchased by such Agent at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof less a discount equivalent to the applicable commissions set forth in hereto and may be resold by such Agent at prevailing market prices at the time or times of resale as determined by such Agent. Such purchases as principal shall otherwise be made in accordance with terms agreed upon by the Agent and the Corporation (which shall be agreed upon orally, with written confirmation prepared by the Agent and delivered to the Corporation within two business days of such oral agreement).

controls the Corporation within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Corporation to each Agent, but only with reference to written information relating to such Agent furnished to the Corporation by or on behalf of such Agent specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereof. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Agent may otherwise have. The Corporation acknowledges that (i) the names of the Agents and the statements in the Prospectus required by Item 508 of Regulation S-K set forth in the language on the cover page or under the heading "Plan of Distribution," (ii) the sentences relating to concessions and reallowances, and (iii) the paragraph related to stabilization and syndicate covering transactions in the Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Agents for inclusion in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, and you, as the Agents, confirm that such statements are correct.
            (c)  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this , notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this . In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; , , that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to local counsel), approved by the Agent in the case of subparagraph (a), representing the indemnified parties under subparagraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii).

          (d)  To provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) of this is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Corporation on the grounds of policy or otherwise, the Corporation and the Agents shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Corporation and one or more of the Agents may be subject in such proportion so that each Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the total commissions and underwriting discounts received by such Agent bears to the total sales price from the sale of Notes sold to or through the Agents to the date of such liability, and the Corporation is responsible for the balance. However, if the allocation provided by the foregoing sentence is not permitted by applicable law, the Company and the Agents shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Company and one or more of the Agents may be subject in such proportion to reflect the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Agents on the other in connection with the statements or omissions or alleged statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or such Agent, the parties' relative intents, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission, and any other equitable considerations appropriate in the circumstances. The Company and the Agents agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation (even if the Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to above in this paragraph (d). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) in no case shall an Agent be responsible for any amount in excess of the commissions and underwriting discounts received by such Agent in connection with the Notes from which such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses arise and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this , each person who controls any Agent within the meaning of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Agent, and each person who controls the Corporation within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, each officer of the Corporation who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Corporation shall have the same rights to contribution as the Corporation, subject in each case to the provisions of this paragraph (d). Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d).

[EXTENDIBLE NOTE RIDER]
The Corporation and the purchaser of this Note have agreed that this Note is an Extendible Note, whereby the Corporation has the option to extend the maturity of this Note for one or more whole year periods, as set forth below (each, an "Extension Period"), up to but not beyond the Final Maturity Date set forth below, under the terms of this Note as supplemented by this Extendible Note Rider.
                                Stated Maturity Date: _________________                                 Final Maturity Date: __________________  
The Corporation may exercise its option with respect hereto by delivery to the Trustee a notice of such exercise at least 45, but not more than 60, calendar days prior to the Stated Maturity Date originally in effect with respect hereto or, if the Stated Maturity Date has already been extended, prior to the maturity date then in effect (each, an "Extended Maturity Date"). After such receipt and not later than 40 calendar days prior to the Stated Maturity Date or an Extended Maturity Date, as the case may be (each, an "Existing Maturity Date"), the Issuing and Paying Agent (or any duly appointed paying agent) will mail by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the registered holder hereof a notice (the "Extension Notice") relating to such extension period (the "Extension Period") setting forth (i) the election of the Corporation to extend the Maturity hereof, (ii) the new Extended Maturity Date, (iii) the interest rate applicable to the Extension Period (which interest rate may be higher during the Extension Period), and (iv) the provisions, if any, for redemption during the Extension Period, including the date or dates on which, the period or periods during which and the price or prices at which such redemption may occur during the Extension Period. Upon the mailing by the Trustee (or any duly appointed paying agent) of an Extension Notice to the registered holder hereof, the maturity shall be extended automatically as set forth in the Extension Notice, and, except as modified by the Extension Notice and as described in the next paragraph, this Note will have the same terms as prior to the mailing of such Extension Notice.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 calendar days prior to the Existing Maturity Date hereof (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the immediately succeeding Business Day), the Corporation, at its option, may revoke the interest rate provided for in the Extension Notice and establish a higher interest rate for the Extension Period by mailing or causing the Trustee to mail notice of such higher interest rate, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the registered holder hereof. Such notice shall be irrevocable. Thereafter, this Note will bear such higher interest rate for the Extension Period.    
                                                                                            14
If the Corporation elects to extend the maturity hereof, the registered holder hereof will have the option to elect repayment hereof in whole or in part by the Corporation on the Existing Maturity Date then in effect at a price equal to the principal amount hereof plus any accrued and unpaid interest to such date. In order for this Note to be so repaid on the Existing Maturity Date, the Corporation must receive, at least 15 days but not more than 30 calendar days prior to the Existing Maturity Date then in effect with respect hereto: (i) this Note with the form "Option to Elect Repayment" below duly completed, or (ii) a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission, or a letter from a member of a national securities exchange, or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States, setting forth the name of the registered holder hereof, the principal amount hereof to be repaid, the certificate number, or a description of the tenor and terms hereof, a statement that the option to elect repayment is being exercised thereby, and a guarantee that this Note, together with the duly completed form entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" attached hereto, will be received by the Trustee not later than the fifth Business Day after the date of such telegram, telex, facsimile transmission, or letter; , , that such telegram, telex, facsimile transmission, or letter shall only be effective if this Note and duly completed form are received by the Trustee by such fifth Business Day. Such option may be exercised by the registered holder hereof for less than the aggregate principal amount hereof then outstanding.

At each Renewal Date, as specified below, the Maturity of this Note automatically will be extended to the corresponding New Maturity Date, as specified below, until the Final Maturity Date specified below, unless the registered holder of this Note elects to terminate the automatic extension of the Maturity of this Note or any portion hereof and delivers a completed "Extension Termination Notice" to the Trustee (or any duly appointed paying agent) not less than 15 nor more than 30 calendar days prior to the applicable Renewal Date. The "Extension Termination Notice" may specify that the automatic extension of Maturity of this Note is terminated with respect to all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount of the Note. Upon timely delivery of such Extension Termination Notice, the term of the principal amount of this Note subject to such notice will be deemed automatically to mature on the Stated Maturity Date or the then applicable New Maturity Date, as the case may be.

An election to terminate the automatic extension of the Maturity hereof shall be irrevocable and binding on each holder hereof. Notwithstanding any such extension, the interest rate applicable to this Note will continue to be calculated as set forth in this Note.

MEDIUM-TERM SENIOR NOTE, SERIES K (Floating Rate)
BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION
SECTION 1. . This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Securities of the Corporation unlimited in aggregate principal amount (herein called the "Notes") issued and to be issued under an Indenture dated as of January 1, 1995 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Corporation (successor to NationsBank Corporation) and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (successor in interest to U.S. Bank Trust National Association, successor trustee to BankAmerica National Trust Company, herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 18, 1998 and a Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 7, 2001, to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights thereunder of the Corporation, the Trustee, and the holders of the Notes, and the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is also one of the Notes designated as the Corporation's Senior Medium-Term Notes, Series K, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $10,000,000,000. The Trustee initially shall act as Security Registrar, Transfer Agent, and Issuing and Paying Agent in connection with the Notes. The Notes may bear different dates, mature at different times, bear interest at different rates and vary in such other ways as are provided in the Indenture.
General
SECTION 2. .
Interest Rate Calculations
(a) . As set forth above, this Note may have either or both of the following: (i) a maximum interest rate limit, or ceiling, on the rate at which interest may accrue during any interest period ("Maximum Interest Rate"); or (ii) a minimum interest rate limit, or floor, on the rate at which interest may accrue during any interest period ("Minimum Interest Rate"); , , that the interest rate on this Note will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.
General
provided
however
The Base Rate (as defined herein) with respect to this Note may be (i) the federal funds rate, (ii) LIBOR, (iii) the prime rate, (iv) the treasury rate, or (v) such other rate as is described on the face hereof and on a rider to this Note.
Except as described below, this Note will bear interest at the rate determined by reference to the appropriate interest rate basis (the "Base Rate") and Index Maturity, each as specified above, (i) plus or minus the Spread, if any, specified above or (ii) multiplied by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified above. The interest rate in effect during an Interest Reset Period will be the rate determined on the calculation date by reference to the Interest Determination Date (as determined in the next paragraph).
The "calculation date" pertaining to any Interest Determination Date will be the date by which the Calculation Agent specified above computes the amount of interest owed on this Note for the related Interest Reset Period. The "calculation date" will be the earlier of (a) the tenth calendar day after the related Interest Determination Date or, if that day is not a Business Day,
                                                                                     7
the next succeeding Business Day or (b) the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or the Stated Maturity Date or the date of redemption or the date of prepayment, as the case may be.
The interest rate in effect on each day shall be (a) if such day is an Interest Reset Date, as specified above, the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date pertaining to such Interest Reset Date or (b) if such day is not an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the immediately preceding Interest Reset Date, that (i) the interest rate in effect from the Original Issue Date to the initial Interest Reset Date shall be the Initial Interest Rate specified above, and (ii) the interest rate in effect for the 10 calendar days immediately prior to the Maturity Date shall be the rate in effect on the 10th calendar day preceding such Maturity Date. If any Interest Reset Date otherwise would be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that if the Base Rate specified above is LIBOR and if such next Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
provided
The "Interest Determination Date" with respect to any Note that has as its Base Rate the federal funds rate or the prime rate will be the Business Day immediately preceding the related Interest Reset Date. The "Interest Determination Date" with respect to any Note that has LIBOR as its Base Rate will be the second London Banking Day preceding the related Interest Reset Date unless the index currency is pounds sterling, in which case the Interest Determination Date will be the Interest Reset Date. The "Interest Determination Date" with respect to any Note that has as its Base Rate the treasury rate will be the day of the week in which the related Interest Reset Date falls on which Treasury bills of the Index Maturity specified on the face of this Note normally would be auctioned; , , that if an auction is held on the Friday of the week preceding the related Interest Reset Date, the related "Interest Determination Date" shall be such preceding Friday.
provided
however
For a Note whose interest rate is determined by reference to two or more Base Rates, the "Interest Determination Date" shall be the most recent Business Day that is at least two Business Days prior to the applicable Interest Reset Date for the Note on which each Base Rate is applicable.
Accrued interest on this Note is calculated by multiplying the principal amount of the Note by an accrued interest factor. The accrued interest factor is the sum of the interest factors calculated for each day in the period for which accrued interest is being calculated. Unless otherwise indicated herein, the accrued interest factor will be computed and interest will be paid as follows:
(1) for interest based on the federal funds rate, LIBOR, the prime rate, or any other floating rate other than the treasury rate (as defined below), the daily interest factor will be computed by dividing the interest rate in effect on that day by 360; and
(2) for interest based on the treasury rate, the daily interest factor will be computed by dividing the interest rate in effect to that day by 365 or 366, as applicable.      
                                                                    8
(b) .
Determination of LIBOR
(i) On each Interest Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will determine LIBOR as follows:
  (A) If "LIBOR Telerate" is specified on the face of this Note, LIBOR will be the rate for deposits in the relevant index currency having the Index Maturity described on the face of this Note commencing on the related Interest Reset Date, as that rate appears on the designated LIBOR page as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on that Interest Determination Date.
(B) If "LIBOR Reuters" is specified on the face of this Note, LIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of the offered rates for deposits in the relevant index currency having the Index Maturity described on the face of this Note commencing on the related Interest Reset Date, as the rates appear on the designated LIBOR page as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on that Interest Determination Date, if at least two offered rates appear on the designated LIBOR page, except that, if the designated LIBOR page only provides for a single rate, that single rate will be used.
If the face of this Note does not specify "LIBOR Telerate" or "LIBOR Reuters," the LIBOR rate will be LIBOR Telerate.

(i) If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the calculation date or does not appear on Telerate Page 120, the federal funds rate will be the rate on that Interest Determination Date, as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source for the purposes of displaying the applicable rate, under the caption "Federal Funds (Effective)."  
(ii) If the alternate rate described in (d)(i) above is not published in H.15 Daily Update by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the calculation date, then the Calculation Agent will determine the federal funds rate to be the average of the rates for the last transaction in overnight federal funds quoted by three leading brokers of federal funds transactions in New York City, selected by the Calculation Agent, prior 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on that Interest Determination Date.  
                                                                        11

(B) If the alternative rate described in (e)(ii)(A) above is not published H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the calculation date, then the Calculation Agent will determine the prime rate to be the arithmetic mean of the rates of interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on the Reuters screen US PRIME 1 (as defined below), as that bank's prime rate or base lending rate as in effect as of 11:00 A.M., New York City time on that Interest Determination Date.
(C) If fewer than four rates appear on the Reuters screen US PRIME 1 for that Interest Determination Date, by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, then the prime rate will be the average of the prime rates or base lending rates furnished in New York City by three substitute banks or trust companies (all organized under the laws of the United States or any of its states and having total equity capital of at least $500,000,000) selected by the Calculation Agent on the Interest Determination Date.

[EXTENDIBLE NOTE RIDER]
The Corporation and the purchaser of this Note have agreed that this Note is an Extendible Note, whereby the Corporation has the option to extend the maturity of this Note for one or more whole year periods, as set forth below (each, an "Extension Period"), up to but not beyond the Final Maturity Date set forth below, under the terms of this Note as supplemented by this Extendible Note Rider.
                    Stated Maturity Date: ____________________                     Final Maturity Date:  _____________________  
The Corporation may exercise its option with respect hereto by delivery to the Trustee a notice of such exercise at least 45, but not more than 60, calendar days prior to the Stated Maturity Date originally in effect with respect hereto or, if the Stated Maturity Date has already been extended, prior to the maturity date then in effect (each, an "Extended Maturity Date"). After such receipt and not later than 40 calendar days prior to the Stated Maturity Date or an Extended Maturity Date, as the case may be (each, an "Existing Maturity Date"), the Issuing and Paying Agent (or any duly appointed paying agent) will mail by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the registered holder hereof a notice (the "Extension Notice") relating to such extension period (the "Extension Period") setting forth (i) the election of the Corporation to extend the Maturity hereof, (ii) the new Extended Maturity Date, (iii) the interest rate applicable to the Extension Period (which interest rate may be higher during the Extension Period), and (iv) the provisions, if any, for redemption during the Extension Period, including the date or dates on which, the period or periods during which and the price or prices at which such redemption may occur during the Extension Period. Upon the mailing by the Trustee (or any duly appointed paying agent) of an Extension Notice to the registered holder hereof, the maturity shall be extended automatically as set forth in the Extension Notice, and, except as modified by the Extension Notice and as described in the next paragraph, this Note will have the same terms as prior to the mailing of such Extension Notice.

[EXTENDIBLE NOTE RIDER]
The Corporation and the purchaser of this Note have agreed that this Note is an Extendible Note, whereby the Corporation has the option to extend the maturity of this Note for one or more whole year periods, as set forth below (each, an "Extension Period"), up to but not beyond the Final Maturity Date set forth below, under the terms of this Note as supplemented by this Extendible Note Rider.
                  Stated Maturity Date: _____________________________                   Final Maturity Date:  ______________________________  
        The Corporation may exercise its option with respect hereto by delivery to the Trustee a notice of such exercise at least 45, but not more than 60, calendar days prior to the Stated Maturity Date originally in effect with respect hereto or, if the Stated Maturity Date has already been extended, prior to the maturity date then in effect (each, an "Extended Maturity Date"). After such receipt and not later than 40 calendar days prior to the Stated Maturity Date or an Extended Maturity Date, as the case may be (each, an "Existing Maturity Date"), the Issuing and Paying Agent (or any duly appointed paying agent) will mail by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the registered holder hereof a notice (the "Extension Notice") relating to such extension period (the "Extension Period") setting forth (i) the election of the Corporation to extend the Maturity hereof, (ii) the new Extended Maturity Date, (iii) the interest rate applicable to the Extension Period (which interest rate may be higher during the Extension Period), and (iv) the provisions, if any, for redemption during the Extension Period, including the date or dates on which, the period or periods during which and the price or prices at which such redemption may occur during the Extension Period. Upon the mailing by the Trustee (or any duly appointed paying agent) of an Extension Notice to the registered holder hereof, the maturity shall be extended automatically as set forth in the Extension Notice, and, except as modified by the Extension Notice and as described in the next paragraph, this Note will have the same terms as prior to the mailing of such Extension Notice.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 calendar days prior to the Existing Maturity Date hereof (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the immediately succeeding Business Day), the Corporation, at its option, may revoke the interest rate provided for in the Extension Notice and establish a higher interest rate for the Extension Period by mailing or causing the Trustee to mail notice of such higher interest rate, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the registered holder hereof. Such notice shall be irrevocable. Thereafter, this Note will bear such higher interest rate for the Extension Period.  
                                                                                         14
        If the Corporation elects to extend the maturity hereof, the registered holder hereof will have the option to elect repayment hereof in whole or in part by the Corporation on the Existing Maturity Date then in effect at a price equal to the principal amount hereof plus any accrued and unpaid interest to such date. In order for this Note to be so repaid on the Existing Maturity Date, the Corporation must receive, at least 15 days but not more than 30 calendar days prior to the Existing Maturity Date then in effect with respect hereto: (i) this Note with the form "Option to Elect Repayment" below duly completed, or (ii) a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission, or a letter from a member of a national securities exchange, or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States, setting forth the name of the registered holder hereof, the principal amount hereof to be repaid, the certificate number, or a description of the tenor and terms hereof, a statement that the option to elect repayment is being exercised thereby, and a guarantee that this Note, together with the duly completed form entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" attached hereto, will be received by the Trustee not later than the fifth Business Day after the date of such telegram, telex, facsimile transmission, or letter; , , that such telegram, telex, facsimile transmission, or letter shall only be effective if this Note and duly completed form are received by the Trustee by such fifth Business Day. Such option may be exercised by the registered holder hereof for less than the aggregate principal amount hereof then outstanding.

[RENEWABLE NOTE RIDER]
The Corporation and the purchaser of this Note have agreed that this Note is a Renewable Note which initially matures on the Stated Maturity Date shown on the face hereof. At each Renewal Date, as specified below, the Maturity of this Note automatically will be extended to the corresponding New Maturity Date, as specified below, until the Final Maturity Date specified below, unless the registered holder of this Note elects to terminate the automatic extension of the Maturity of this Note or any portion hereof and delivers a completed "Extension Termination Notice" to the Trustee (or any duly appointed paying agent) not less than 15 nor more than 30 calendar days prior to the applicable Renewal Date. The "Extension Termination Notice" may specify that the automatic extension of Maturity of this Note is terminated with respect to all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount of the Note. Upon timely delivery of such Extension Termination Notice, the term of the principal amount of this Note subject to such notice will be deemed automatically to mature on the Stated Maturity Date or the then applicable New Maturity Date, as the case may be. The remaining principal balance of such Note, if any, will be deemed to automatically be extended to the corresponding New Maturity Date but in no circumstances may such Maturity be extended beyond the Final Maturity Date set forth below.

Notwithstanding any such extension, the interest rate applicable to this Note will continue to be calculated as set forth in this Note.

MEDIUM-TERM SUBORDINATED NOTE, SERIES K (Floating Rate)
BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION
SECTION 1. . This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Securities of the Corporation unlimited in aggregate principal amount (herein called the "Notes") issued and to be issued under an Indenture dated as of January 1, 1995 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Corporation (successor to NationsBank Corporation) and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of August 28, 1998, to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights thereunder of the Corporation, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes, and the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is also one of the Notes designated as the Corporation's Subordinated Medium-Term Notes, Series K, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $10,000,000,000. The Trustee initially shall act as Security Registrar, Transfer Agent, and Issuing and Paying Agent in connection with the Notes. The Notes may bear different dates, mature at different times, bear interest at different rates and vary in such other ways as are provided in the Indenture.
General
SECTION 2. .
Interest Rate Calculations
(a) . As set forth above, this Note may have either or both of the following: (i) a maximum interest rate limit, or ceiling, on the rate at which interest may accrue during any interest period ("Maximum Interest Rate"); or (ii) a minimum interest rate limit, or floor, on the rate at which interest may accrue during any interest period ("Minimum Interest Rate"); , , that the interest rate on this Note will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.
General
provided
however
The Base Rate (as defined herein) with respect to this Note may be (i) the federal funds rate, (ii) LIBOR, (iii) the prime rate, (iv) the treasury rate, or (v) such other rate as is described on the face hereof and on a rider to this Note.
Except as described below, this Note will bear interest at the rate determined by reference to the appropriate interest rate basis (the "Base Rate") and Index Maturity, each as specified above, (i) plus or minus the Spread, if any, specified above or (ii) multiplied by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified above. The interest rate in effect during an Interest Reset Period will be the rate determined on the calculation date by reference to the Interest Determination Date (as determined in the next paragraph).
The "calculation date" pertaining to any Interest Determination Date will be the date by which the Calculation Agent specified above computes the amount of interest owed on this Note for the related Interest Reset Period. The "calculation date" will be the earlier of (a) the tenth calendar day after the related Interest Determination Date or, if that day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day or (b) the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable
                                                                                       7
Interest Payment Date or the Stated Maturity Date or the date of redemption or the date of prepayment, as the case may be.
The interest rate in effect on each day shall be (a) if such day is an Interest Reset Date, as specified above, the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date pertaining to such Interest Reset Date or (b) if such day is not an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the immediately preceding Interest Reset Date, that (i) the interest rate in effect from the Original Issue Date to the initial Interest Reset Date shall be the Initial Interest Rate specified above, and (ii) the interest rate in effect for the 10 calendar days immediately prior to the Maturity Date shall be the rate in effect on the 10th calendar day preceding such Maturity Date. If any Interest Reset Date otherwise would be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that if the Base Rate specified above is LIBOR and if such next Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
provided
The "Interest Determination Date" with respect to any Note that has as its Base Rate the federal funds rate or the prime rate will be the Business Day immediately preceding the related Interest Reset Date. The "Interest Determination Date" with respect to any Note that has LIBOR as its Base Rate will be the second London Banking Day preceding the related Interest Reset Date unless the index currency is pounds sterling, in which case the Interest Determination Date will be the Interest Reset Date. The "Interest Determination Date" with respect to any Note that has as its Base Rate the treasury rate will be the day of the week in which the related Interest Reset Date falls on which Treasury bills of the Index Maturity specified on the face of this Note normally would be auctioned; , , that if an auction is held on the Friday of the week preceding the related Interest Reset Date, the related "Interest Determination Date" shall be such preceding Friday.
provided
however
For a Note whose interest rate is determined by reference to two or more Base Rates, the "Interest Determination Date" shall be the most recent Business Day that is at least two Business Days prior to the applicable Interest Reset Date for the Note on which each Base Rate is applicable.
Accrued interest on this Note is calculated by multiplying the principal amount of the Note by an accrued interest factor. The accrued interest factor is the sum of the interest factors calculated for each day in the period for which accrued interest is being calculated. Unless otherwise indicated herein, the accrued interest factor will be computed and interest will be paid as follows:
(1) for interest based on the federal funds rate, LIBOR, the prime rate, or any other floating rate other than the treasury rate (as defined below), the daily interest factor will be computed by dividing the interest rate in effect on that day by 360; and
(2) for interest based on the treasury rate, the daily interest factor will be computed by dividing the interest rate in effect to that day by 365 or 366, as applicable.
                                                      8
 
(b) .
Determination of LIBOR
(i) On each Interest Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will determine LIBOR as follows:
  (A) If "LIBOR Telerate" is specified on the face of this Note, LIBOR will be the rate for deposits in the relevant index currency having the Index Maturity described on the face of this Note commencing on the related Interest Reset Date, as that rate appears on the designated LIBOR page as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on that Interest Determination Date.
(B) If "LIBOR Reuters" is specified on the face of this Note, LIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of the offered rates for deposits in the relevant index currency having the Index Maturity described on the face of this Note commencing on the related Interest Reset Date, as the rates appear on the designated LIBOR page as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on that Interest Determination Date, if at least two offered rates appear on the designated LIBOR page, except that, if the designated LIBOR page only provides for a single rate, that single rate will be used.
If the face of this Note does not specify "LIBOR Telerate" or "LIBOR Reuters," the LIBOR rate will be LIBOR Telerate.
(ii) If "LIBOR Telerate" applies and the rate described above does not appear on that page, or if "LIBOR Reuters" applies and fewer than two of the rates described above appears on that page or no rate appears on any page on which only one rate normally appears, the Calculation Agent will determine LIBOR as follows:
  (A) The Calculation Agent will select four major banks in the London interbank market. On the Interest Determination Date, those four banks will be requested to provided their offered quotations for deposits in the relevant index currency having an Index Maturity specified on the face of this Note commencing on the Interest Reset Date to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 A.M., London time.      
(B) If at least two quotations are provided, the Calculation Agent will determine LIBOR as the arithmetic mean of those quotations.
(C) If fewer than two quotations are provided, the Calculation Agent will select three major banks in New York City. On the Interest Determination Date, those three banks will be requested to provide their offered quotations for loans in the relevant index currency having an Index Maturity specified on the face of this Note commencing on the Interest Reset Date to leading European banks at approximately  
                                                                 9
11:00 A.M., London time. The Calculation Agent will determine LIBOR as the arithmetic mean of those quotations.
(D) If fewer than three New York City banks selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting rates, LIBOR for that Interest Reset Period will remain LIBOR then in effect on the Interest Determination Date.
Determination of Treasury Rate
(i) The "treasury rate" for any Interest Determination Date is the rate set at the auction of direct obligations of the United States ("Treasury bills") having the Index Maturity described on the face of this Note, as specified under the caption "Investment Rate" on the display on Moneyline Telerate, or any successor service, on page 56 or any other page as may replace page 56, or page 57 or any other page as may replace page 57. (iii) The bond equivalent will be calculated using the following formula:
(ii) If the rate cannot be determined as described in (c)(i) above, the treasury rate will be determined as follows:
  (A) If the rate is not displayed on Moneyline Telerate by 3:00 P.M. , New York City time, on the related calculation date, the treasury rate will be the rate of Treasury bills as published in H.15 Daily Update, or another recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying the applicable rate, under the caption "U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Bills/Secondary Market."  
(B) If the rate is not published in (c)(ii)(A) above by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the related calculation date, the treasury rate will be the bond equivalent yield, as defined below, of the auction rate of the applicable Treasury bills as announced by the United States Department of the Treasury.
(C) If the rated referred to in (c)(ii)(B) is not announced by the United States Department of the Treasury, or if the auction is not held, the treasury rate will be the bond equivalent yield on the particular Interest Determination Date of the applicable Treasury bills as published in H.15(519) under the caption "U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Bills/Secondary Market."
(D) If the rate referred to in (c)(ii)(C) is not published by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the related calculation date, the treasury rate will be the rate on the particular Interest Determination Date of the application Treasury bills as published in H.15 Daily Update, or another recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying the applicable rate, under the caption "U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Bills/Secondary Market."
(E) If the rate referred to in (c)(ii)(D) is not published by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the related calculation date, the treasury rate will be rate on the particular Interest Determination Date calculated by the Calculation Agent as the bond equivalent yield of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid rates, as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on that Interest Determination Date, of three primary Untied States government securities dealers, selected by the  
                                                                            10
Calculation Agent, for the issue of Treasury bills with a remaining maturity closest to the particular Index Maturity.
(F) If the dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in (c)(ii)(E) above, the treasury rate will be the treasury rate in effect on the particular Interest Determination Date.  
  Bond equivalent     =      ________ x 100                                          360-(D x M)

(i) If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the calculation date or does not appear on Telerate Page 120, the federal funds rate will be the rate on that Interest Determination Date, as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source for the purposes of displaying the applicable rate, under the caption "Federal Funds (Effective)."    
(ii) If the alternate rate described in (d)(i) above is not published in H.15 Daily Update by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the calculation date, then the Calculation Agent will determine the federal funds rate to be the average of the rates for the last transaction in overnight federal funds quoted by three leading brokers of federal funds transactions in New York City, selected by the Calculation Agent, prior to 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on that Interest Determination Date.
                                                                         11

The Corporation and the purchaser of this Note have agreed that this Note is an Extendible Note, whereby the Corporation has the option to extend the maturity of this Note for one or more whole year periods, as set forth below (each, an "Extension Period"), up to but not beyond the Final Maturity Date set forth below, under the terms of this Note as supplemented by this Extendible Note Rider.

The Corporation may exercise its option with respect hereto by delivery to the Trustee a notice of such exercise at least 45, but not more than 60, calendar days prior to the Stated Maturity Date originally in effect with respect hereto or, if the Stated Maturity Date has already been extended, prior to the maturity date then in effect (each, an "Extended Maturity Date"). After such receipt and not later than 40 calendar days prior to the Stated Maturity Date or an Extended Maturity Date, as the case may be (each, an "Existing Maturity Date"), the Issuing and Paying Agent (or any duly appointed paying agent) will mail by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the registered holder hereof a notice (the "Extension Notice") relating to such extension period (the "Extension Period") setting forth (i) the election of the Corporation to extend the Maturity hereof, (ii) the new Extended Maturity Date, (iii) the interest rate applicable to the Extension Period (which interest rate may be higher during the Extension Period), and (iv) the provisions, if any, for redemption during the Extension Period, including the date or dates on which, the period or periods during which and the price or prices at which such redemption may occur during the Extension Period. Upon the mailing by the Trustee (or any duly appointed paying agent) of an Extension Notice to the registered holder hereof, the maturity shall be extended automatically as set forth in the Extension Notice, and, except as modified by the Extension Notice and as described in the next paragraph, this Note will have the same terms as prior to the mailing of such Extension Notice.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 calendar days prior to the Existing Maturity Date hereof (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the immediately succeeding Business Day), the Corporation, at its option, may revoke the interest rate provided for in the Extension Notice and establish a higher interest rate for the Extension Period by mailing or causing the Trustee to mail notice of such higher interest rate, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the registered holder hereof. Such notice shall be irrevocable. Thereafter, this Note will bear such higher interest rate for the Extension Period.    
                                                                                    20
If the Corporation elects to extend the maturity hereof, the registered holder hereof will have the option to elect repayment hereof in whole or in part by the Corporation on the Existing Maturity Date then in effect at a price equal to the principal amount hereof plus any accrued and unpaid interest to such date. In order for this Note to be so repaid on the Existing Maturity Date, the Corporation must receive, at least 15 days but not more than 30 calendar days prior to the Existing Maturity Date then in effect with respect hereto: (i) this Note with the form "Option to Elect Repayment" below duly completed, or (ii) a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission, or a letter from a member of a national securities exchange, or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States, setting forth the name of the registered holder hereof, the principal amount hereof to be repaid, the certificate number, or a description of the tenor and terms hereof, a statement that the option to elect repayment is being exercised thereby, and a guarantee that this Note, together with the duly completed form entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" attached hereto, will be received by the Trustee not later than the fifth Business Day after the date of such telegram, telex, facsimile transmission, or letter; , , that such telegram, telex, facsimile transmission, or letter shall only be effective if this Note and duly completed form are received by the Trustee by such fifth Business Day. Such option may be exercised by the registered holder hereof for less than the aggregate principal amount hereof then outstanding.

[RENEWABLE NOTE RIDER]
The Corporation and the purchaser of this Note have agreed that this Note is a Renewable Note which initially matures on the Stated Maturity Date shown on the face hereof. At each Renewal Date, as specified below, the Maturity of this Note automatically will be extended to the corresponding New Maturity Date, as specified below, until the Final Maturity Date specified below, unless the registered holder of this Note elects to terminate the automatic extension of the Maturity of this Note or any portion hereof and delivers a completed "Extension Termination Notice" to the Trustee (or any duly appointed paying agent) not less than 15 nor more than 30 calendar days prior to the applicable Renewal Date. The "Extension Termination Notice" may specify that the automatic extension of Maturity of this Note is terminated with respect to all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount of the Note. Upon timely delivery of such Extension Termination Notice, the term of the principal amount of this Note subject to such notice will be deemed automatically to mature on the Stated Maturity Date or the then applicable New Maturity Date, as the case may be. The remaining principal balance of such Note, if any, will be deemed to automatically be extended to the corresponding New Maturity Date but in no circumstances may such Maturity be extended beyond the Final Maturity Date set forth below. An election to terminate the automatic extension of the Maturity hereof shall be irrevocable and binding on each holder hereof. Notwithstanding any such extension, the interest rate applicable to this Note will continue to be calculated as set forth in this Note.

             Re: Public Offering of up to an Aggregate of $10,000,000,000 of Bank of America                    Corporation Medium-Term Notes, Series K
Ladies and Gentlemen:
        We have acted as counsel to Bank of America Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3, Registration No. 333-112708 (the "Registration Statement"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and (ii) the Debt Prospectus dated April 14, 2004 constituting a part thereof, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement dated April 15, 2004 (as so supplemented, the "Prospectus"), relating to the issuance and sale from time to time by the Corporation of up to an aggregate of $10,000,000,000 principal amount of its Senior Medium-Term Notes, Series K, and its Subordinated Medium-Term Notes, Series K (collectively referred to as the "Medium-Term Notes"). The Medium-Term Notes are to be issued, separately or together, and are to be sold from time to time as set forth in the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto.
         As such counsel, we have examined and are familiar with such original or photocopies or certified copies of such records of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, certificates of officers of the Corporation and its subsidiaries and of public officials and such other documents as we have deemed relevant or necessary as the basis for the opinions set forth below. In such examinations, we have assumed the legal capacity of natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures on, and the authenticity of, all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as photocopies thereof and the authenticity of the originals of such copies. We have also relied upon statements of fact contained in documents that we have examined in connection with our representation of the Corporation.
        Based solely upon the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, and subject to the limitations, qualifications and exceptions set forth below, we are of the opinion that the Medium-Term Notes have been duly authorized and, when the terms of the Medium-Term Notes have been established and when the Medium-Term Notes have been completed, executed, authenticated and delivered in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture dated January 1, 1995 between the Registrant (successor to NationsBank Corporation ("NationsBank")) and The Bank of New York (successor in interest to U.S. Bank Trust National Association, as successor trustee to BankAmerica National Trust Company), as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 18, 1998 and a Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 7, 2001, or the Indenture dated January 1, 1995 between the Registrant (successor to NationsBank) and The Bank of New York, as trustee, as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of August 28, 1998, the Board Resolution (as defined in the respective Indentures) dated April 15, 2004, and the Distribution Agreement among the Corporation and the Agents named in Exhibit A thereto, against payment of the consideration therefor, will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Corporation subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors now or hereafter in effect, and to equitable principles that may limit the right to specific enforcement of remedies, and further subject to 12 U.S.C.  1818(b)(6)(D) (or any successor statute) and any bank regulatory powers now or hereafter in effect and to the application of principles of public policy.
       We hereby consent to be named in the Registration Statement as attorneys who passed upon the legality of the Medium-Term Notes and to the filing of a copy of this opinion as part of the Corporation's Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed for the purpose of including this opinion as part of the Registration Statement.
                                                                                Very truly yours,
                                                                                 /S/ HELMS MULLISS & WICKER, PLLC
