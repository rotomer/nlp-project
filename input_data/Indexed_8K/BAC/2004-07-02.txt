CHARLOTTE  Bank of America announced today that it has reached an agreement to settle class action litigation brought on behalf of purchasers of Enron securities that is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas (Civil Action No. H-01-3624).
 
Under the terms of the settlement agreement, which is subject to court approval, Bank of America will make a payment of approximately $69 million to the settlement class in Newby v. Enron Corp. et al, led by the Regents of the University of California. The class consists of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired securities issued by Enron during the period from October 19, 1998 to November 27, 2001. Plaintiffs' attorney fees will be paid from the settlement amount.
 
The bank believes it is in the best interests of the company to resolve these claims and put this litigation behind it and focus efforts on creating greater value for shareholders. Under the settlement, Bank of America denied that it violated any law and explained that it settled the matter solely to eliminate the uncertainties, expense and distraction of further protracted litigation.
