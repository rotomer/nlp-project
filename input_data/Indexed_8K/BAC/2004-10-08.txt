ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS.
 
On October 7, 2004, Dr. Enrico Bondi, in his capacity as Extraordinary Commissioner in the Parmalat bankruptcy proceedings, filed an action against Bank of America, N.A. and certain of its affiliates in the U.S. District Court in the Western District of North Carolina, Asheville Division (Civil No. 1:04cv215). The action alleges among other things that Bank of America knew of fraud at Parmalat and assisted the company in perpetuating such fraud. We intend to vigorously defend this matter.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
