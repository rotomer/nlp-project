In ., the trial court denied plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction which had been sought by plaintiffs after the February 2004 jury verdict.
Paul J. Miller v. Bank of America, N.A
 
On October 13, 2004, the trial court issued its tentative ruling on the two claims tried to the court at the conclusion of the February 2004 jury trial, ruling on both claims against Bank of America, N.A. (the "Bank"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation (the "Registrant"). The tentative ruling would award the plaintiff class restitution in the amount of $284 million, plus interest and attorneys' fees. The tentative ruling would also award class members who suffered substantial emotional or economic harm an additional $1,000 penalty but leaves unclear to which class members this award would apply. The tentative decision also includes injunctive relief.
 
The trial court has set a November 30, 2004 hearing to consider objections to its tentative ruling, with a final judgment to be entered thereafter. The Bank will appeal any adverse final judgment and move to stay any injunction pending appeal.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION
