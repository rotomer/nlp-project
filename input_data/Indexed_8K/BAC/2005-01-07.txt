ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS.
 
The following disclosure supplements the disclosure regarding made by Bank of America Corporation (the "Registrant") in previous filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Paul J. Miller v. Bank of America, N.A.
 
On December 30, 2004, the trial court issued its final ruling on the two claims tried to the court at the conclusion of the February 2004 jury trial, ruling on both claims against Bank of America, N.A. (the "Bank"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Registrant. The final ruling awards the plaintiff class restitution in the amount of $284 million, plus interest and attorneys' fees. The final ruling also concludes that any class member whose account was wrongfully debited suffered substantial emotional or economic harm and is entitled to an additional $1,000 penalty, and includes injunctive relief which is temporarily stayed.
 
Once the jury verdict and final decision are entered as a judgment, the Bank will appeal and move to stay the injunction pending appeal.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
