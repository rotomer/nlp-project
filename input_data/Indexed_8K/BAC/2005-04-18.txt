CHARLOTTE  Bank of America Corporation today reported that first quarter net income rose to $4.70 billion, or $1.14 per share (diluted), from $2.68 billion, or $0.91 per share, a year ago. Under purchase accounting rules, results reported for the first quarter of 2004 do not include the impact of FleetBoston Financial Corporation, which was acquired on April 1, 2004. Return on common equity in the first quarter was 19.30 percent.
 
In addition to the impact of Fleet, net income increased due to strong results throughout the company's businesses, lower credit costs, increasing merger-related efficiencies and gains from the sales of securities.
 
The integration of Fleet remained on schedule as several systems conversions were completed during the quarter and additional conversions were started. Direct cost savings achieved in the quarter totaled $437 million.
 
First quarter earnings included merger and restructuring charges of $112 million pre-tax, which reduced net income by 2 cents per share.
 
"I am very pleased with the continued momentum of our businesses," said Kenneth D. Lewis, chairman and chief executive officer. "The continuing successful integration of the Fleet franchise has bolstered our ability to achieve future growth and value creation for our shareholders. In particular, we saw the strongest commercial loan growth in many quarters across our company and deposit growth continues to be robust.
 
"This quarter shows how our balanced business mix is paying off," Lewis continued. "The power of our franchise is evident in our ability this quarter to deliver an efficiency ratio below our target of 50 percent."

2005 First Quarter Versus 2004 First Quarter Financial Summary
 
Revenue
 
Revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis grew to $14.22 billion from $9.70 billion the previous year.
 
Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was $8.07 billion compared to $5.97 billion a year earlier. In addition to the impact of Fleet, the increase was driven by consumer and middle-market business loan growth, higher domestic deposit levels and asset-liability management portfolio activity net of the impact of rates. These increases were partially offset by a lower trading-related contribution and lower levels of foreign loans.
 
Noninterest income was $6.15 billion compared to $3.73 billion a year earlier. In addition to the impact of Fleet, these results were driven by higher investment and brokerage services, equity investment gains, trading account profits and card income.
 
During the quarter, the company realized $659 million in securities gains. The company realized $495 million in securities gains in the first quarter of 2004.
 
Efficiency
 
With strong revenue growth and expense control, the efficiency ratio, including merger and restructuring charges, improved to 49.62 percent. Noninterest expense was $7.06 billion compared to $5.43 billion a year ago, driven by the addition of Fleet.

Credit Quality
 
All major commercial credit quality indicators continued to show positive trends. Credit card charge-offs grew as a result of the Fleet acquisition, card portfolio growth and seasoning and increases in minimum payment requirements as compared to the first quarter of 2004. Consumer credit quality remained strong in all other categories.
 
 
 
 
 
Capital Management
 
Total shareholders' equity was $98.52 billion at March 31, 2005. Period-end assets grew to $1.21 trillion. The Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 8.20 percent, compared to 8.10 percent at December 31, 2004 and 7.73 percent a year ago.
 
During the quarter, Bank of America paid a cash dividend of $0.45 per share. The company also issued 32 million shares, primarily related to employee stock options and ownership plans, and repurchased 43 million shares. Average common shares issued and outstanding were 4.03 billion in the first quarter, compared to 4.03 billion in the fourth quarter of 2004 and 2.88 billion in the first quarter of 2004.

First Quarter 2005 Business Segment Results
 
Global Consumer and Small Business Banking
 
Global Consumer and Small Business Banking earnings in the first quarter were $1.90 billion. Revenue in the first quarter was $6.96 billion.
 
As compared to the first quarter of 2004, improvement in mortgage banking income and continued growth in card income and service charges was somewhat offset by an increase in provision.
 
Excluding the impact of Fleet, average deposits increased slightly while loan balances continued to grow, led by growth in credit card and home equity loans. Credit and debit card purchase volumes also grew as more customers moved away from writing checks and using cash. Loan production in Consumer Real Estate was led by significant improvement in home equity volume as compared to the first quarter of 2004.
 
Global Business and Financial Services
 
Global Business and Financial Services earnings in the first quarter were $1.12 billion. Revenue in the first quarter was $2.73 billion.
 
Excluding the impact of Fleet, steady growth in commercial lending continued. The benefit of steady loan and deposit growth was partially offset by a slight compression in loan margin spreads as compared to the first quarter of 2004.

Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking
 
Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking earnings in the first quarter were $721 million. Revenue in the first quarter was $2.63 billion.
 
The business recorded its best quarter ever in earnings and revenue. This was primarily due to increases in trading profits, led by increased sales of interest rate products, equities and strong portfolio management in fixed income. Also contributing to the increase in trading-related revenue were gains on credit portfolio hedges. These increases were somewhat offset by lower investment banking fees as compared to the first quarter of 2004.
 
Due to the favorable credit environment, Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking had a negative provision in the large corporate loan book in the first quarter of 2005.
 
Global Wealth and Investment Management
 
Global Wealth and Investment Management earnings in the first quarter were $576 million. Revenue in the first quarter was $1.79 billion.
 
Excluding the impact of Fleet, revenue and earnings growth was led by increases from the impact of loan and deposit growth and asset management fees, as well as strong expense management. These factors were partially offset by lower brokerage volume and price compression in addition to a drop in assets under management.
 
All Other
 
All Other reflected $379 million of net income for the quarter. Securities gains related to asset/liability management are included in this reporting segment. Equity Investments earned $98 million compared to a loss of $29 million in the first quarter of 2004.
 
Note:
Marc Oken, chief financial officer, will discuss first quarter results in a conference call at 9:30 a.m. (Eastern Time) today. The call can be accessed via a webcast available on the Bank of America Web site at http://www.bankofamerica.com/investor/.

Reconciliation to GAAP financial measures
 
Supplemental financial data presented on an operating basis is a basis of presentation not defined by GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) that excludes merger and restructuring charges. We believe that the exclusion of merger and restructuring charges, which represent events outside our normal operations, provides a meaningful period-to-period comparison and is more reflective of normalized operations.
 
Shareholder value added (SVA) is a key measure of performance not defined by GAAP that is used in managing our growth strategy orientation and strengthening our focus on generating long-term growth and shareholder value. SVA is used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity (i.e. capital) at the individual unit level and is an integral component in the analytics for resource allocation. Using SVA as a performance measure places specific focus on whether incremental investments generate returns in excess of the costs of capital associated with those investments. Each business segment has a goal for growth in SVA reflecting the individual segment's business and customer strategy.
 
Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. See the Tables below for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the quarters ended March 31, 2005, December 31, 2004, September 30, 2004, June 30, 2004 and March 31, 2004.
