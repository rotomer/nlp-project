CHARLOTTE  Bank of America Corporation today reported that second quarter net income rose 12 percent to $4.30 billion from $3.85 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share increased 14 percent to $1.06 per share (diluted) from $0.93. Return on average common shareholders' equity in the second quarter was 17.54 percent.
 
Second quarter earnings included merger and restructuring charges of $121 million pre-tax, which reduced earnings per share by 2 cents.
 
Improved results were driven by a 7 percent increase in revenue and 3 percent decrease in noninterest expense. The revenue increase was primarily due to strong noninterest income growth, led by the growth in card income and service charges. Also contributing were gains from whole loan sales and equity investment gains. Noninterest expense fell due to savings created by the merger with FleetBoston Financial Corporation.
 
Nearly all major customer-related actions related to the Fleet integration have now been accomplished as several major systems conversions were completed during the quarter. Direct cost savings achieved in the second quarter totaled $441 million. Total savings from the Fleet merger are projected to be $1.85 billion for 2005.
 
For the first six months of 2005, Bank of America earned $8.99 billion, or $2.20 per share (diluted), compared to $6.53 billion, or $1.85 per share, a year earlier.
 
During the second quarter Bank of America agreed to buy approximately 9 percent of the stock of China Construction Bank for $3 billion, with the option of increasing its stake in future years. Bank of America also announced a definitive agreement to acquire MBNA Corporation. The MBNA acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter.

"I am very pleased with our continued strong performance in 2005," said Kenneth D. Lewis, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our ability to achieve profitable growth in the midst of a challenging interest rate environment demonstrates the value and resilience of our balanced business mix as well as the efficiency advantages of our large-scale enterprise."
 
"As we successfully complete the Fleet integration, and look ahead to the MBNA acquisition, we will build upon a successful customer-centric formula to provide continued long-term growth for investors from our expanded and enhanced financial services platform," Lewis said. "I am very proud that we are continuing to achieve customer growth while completing our integration of Fleet."

2005 Second Quarter Financial Summary
 
Revenue
 
Revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis grew to $14.21 billion from $13.22 billion the same quarter last year.
 
Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was $7.84 billion, up 1 percent from $7.75 billion a year earlier. The increase was due to growth in consumer and business loans, a larger asset-liability management portfolio and higher domestic deposit levels. These increases were partially offset by the impact of further flattening of the yield curve, a lower trading-related contribution and lower levels of large corporate and foreign loans.
 
Noninterest income rose 16 percent to $6.37 billion from $5.47 billion a year earlier. These results were driven by gains from whole loan sales, card income, service charges and equity investment gains. These improvements were offset by weaker trading profits and investment banking income as well as lower mortgage banking income.
 
During the quarter, the company realized $325 million in securities gains, down significantly from $795 million in the second quarter of 2004.
 
Efficiency
 
Noninterest expense declined 3 percent to $7.02 billion compared to $7.23 billion a year ago. The efficiency ratio improved to 49.42 percent (48.56 percent excluding merger and restructuring charges). For 2005 year-to-date, the company has achieved operating leverage of 13.5 percent.

Credit Quality
 
Most major credit quality indicators showed positive trends. The company recorded net recoveries on commercial loans. Credit card charge-offs increased from the second quarter of 2004 reflecting growth and seasoning in the portfolio, the impact of last year's changes in minimum payment requirements and bankruptcy reform. Consumer credit quality remained strong in all other categories.
 
 
 
 
 
Capital Management
 
Total shareholders' equity was $100.54 billion at June 30, 2005. Period-end assets grew to $1.25 trillion. The Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 8.06 percent, compared to 8.20 percent at March 31, 2005 and a year ago.
 
During the quarter, Bank of America paid a cash dividend of $0.45 per share. The Board of Directors has increased the quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share, effective with the payment in the third quarter. The company issued 22 million shares, primarily related to employee stock options and ownership plans, and repurchased 40 million shares. Average common shares issued and outstanding were 4.01 billion in the second quarter, compared to 4.03 billion in the first quarter of 2005 and 4.06 billion in the second quarter of 2004.

Second Quarter 2005 Business Segment Results
 
Global Consumer and Small Business Banking
 
Global Consumer and Small Business Banking earnings decreased 8 percent to $1.60 billion from $1.74 billion a year earlier. Revenue rose 5 percent to $7.06 billion.
 
The decline in earnings occurred because of an increase in provision expense due to increased credit card charge-offs. Also, included in this quarter's provision was $210 million to establish a reserve for anticipated net charge-offs from additional minimum payment requirements for consumer credit cardholders, which will be implemented in the fourth quarter.
 
Business momentum continued to be solid, led by growth in card income and service charges as well as increases in home equity loans. Service charges rose 12 percent and benefited from a growing number of new consumer and business accounts. Card income increased 25 percent from a year ago due to significant growth in debit and credit card volumes as well as the acquisition of NPC, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
Global Business and Financial Services
 
Global Business and Financial Services earnings rose 43 percent to $1.22 billion from $849 million a year earlier. Revenue increased 11 percent to $2.69 billion.
 
Strong loan and deposit growth fueled a $149 million increase in net interest income while growth in service charges was the major driver of higher noninterest income. A negative provision expense of $164 million and a 7 percent decline in noninterest expense added to the earnings improvement. The business also recorded gains on sales of debt securities in Latin America.

Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking
 
Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking earnings increased 12 percent to $461 million from $411 million a year ago. Revenue declined 19 percent to $2.12 billion.
 
The earnings increase was primarily driven by the absence of litigation expense incurred in the second quarter of 2004. Revenue declined as trading profits and investment banking income decreased in the face of weak market conditions. However, the company outperformed the market in mergers and acquisitions, advisory services and investment grade and high yield debt offerings. Investment and brokerage service fees rose. Credit quality continued to be strong.
 
Global Wealth and Investment Management
 
Global Wealth and Investment Management earnings increased 48 percent to $590 million from $398 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 19 percent to $1.84 billion.
 
Asset management fees rose as assets under management increased. Earnings also benefited from continued strong expense management.
 
All Other
 
All Other reflected $433 million of net income for the quarter. This included securities gains of $204 million and whole loan sale gains of $278 million related to asset-liability management. The Equity Investments business earned $167 million compared to a loss of $13 million in the second quarter of 2004.

Marc Oken, chief financial officer, will discuss second quarter results in a conference call at 9:30 a.m. (Eastern Time) today. The call can be accessed via a webcast available on the Bank of America Web site at http://www.bankofamerica.com/investor/.

Reconciliation to GAAP financial measures
 
Supplemental financial data presented on an operating basis is a basis of presentation not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) that excludes merger and restructuring charges. We believe that the exclusion of merger and restructuring charges, which represent events outside our normal operations, provides a meaningful period-to-period comparison and is more reflective of normalized operations.
 
Shareholder value added (SVA) is a key measure of performance not defined by GAAP that is used in managing our growth strategy orientation and strengthening our focus on generating long-term growth and shareholder value. SVA is used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity (i.e. capital) at the individual unit level and is an integral component in the analytics for resource allocation. Using SVA as a performance measure places specific focus on whether incremental investments generate returns in excess of the costs of capital associated with those investments. Each business segment has a goal for growth in SVA reflecting the individual segment's business and customer strategy.
 
Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. See the Tables below for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the quarters ended June 30, 2005, March 31, 2005, December 31, 2004, September 30, 2004 and June 30, 2004, and the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004.
