ITEM 2.03.  CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT
 
            Bank of America Corporation ("Bank of America") maintains a Euro Medium-Term Note Program (the "Program") which provides for the issuance, from time to time, of its senior and subordinated debt securities in the international capital markets.  Effective as of August 4, 2005, Bank of America has increased to U.S. $20 billion (or the equivalent in other currencies) the maximum aggregate principal amount authorized to be outstanding at any time under the Program. Under the Program, Bank of America may issue unsecured medium-term notes with such terms, including currency, rate and maturity, as are agreed between Bank of America and the purchasers of the notes at the time of sale. These notes are issued pursuant to the terms of an Amended and Restated Agency Agreement dated as of August 4, 2005, among the Registrant and JPMorgan Chase Bank, London Branch, as issuing and principal paying agent.        
           Notes are issued under the Program pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"); are not registered under the Act; and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to a U.S. person absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Act.
        As of August 4, 2005, there is approximately U.S. $10.1 billion (or its equivalent in other currencies) in principal amount of notes outstanding under the Program, leaving approximately U.S. $9.9 billion (or its equivalent in other currencies) available for issuance under the Program as of that date.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
Dated:  August 9, 2005
