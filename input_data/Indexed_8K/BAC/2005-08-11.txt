The initial public offering price per Capital Security and the purchase price per Capital Security are set forth in Schedule B.  As compensation to the Underwriters for their commitments hereunder and in view of the fact that the proceeds of the sale of the Capital Securities will be used to purchase the Junior Subordinated Notes of the Company, the Company hereby agrees to pay at the Closing Time to the Underwriters, a commission per Capital Security determined by agreement between the Representative and the Company for the Capital Securities to be delivered by the Trust hereunder at the Closing Time.  The commission is set forth in Schedule B.
          (b)            Payment of the purchase price for, and delivery of certificates for, the Capital Securities shall be made at the office of Morrison & Foerster LLP, or at such other place as shall be agreed upon by the Representative, the Company and the Trust, at 8:00 A.M. New York time on the fourth business day (unless postponed in accordance with the provisions of Section 8) after the date hereof, or such other time not later than ten business days after such date as shall be agreed upon by the Representative, the Trust and the Company (such time and date of payment and delivery being herein called "Closing Time").  Payment shall be made to the Trust by wire transfer or certified or official bank check or similar same day funds payable to the order of the Trust to an account designated by the Trust, against delivery to the Representative for the respective accounts of the Underwriters of certificates for the Capital Securities to be purchased by them.  Unless otherwise agreed, certificates for the Capital Securities shall be in the form set forth in the Declaration, and such certificates shall be registered in the name of The Bank of New York Depository (Nominees) Limited as nominee for, and shall be deposited with The Bank of
New York, as common depositary for Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear System and Clearstream Banking, societe anonyme.
         (c)            At the Closing Time, the Company will pay, or cause to be paid, the commission payable at such time to the Underwriters under this Section 2 hereof by wire transfer or certified or official bank check or checks payable to the Representative in same day funds.
        (d)            In connection with offering of the Capital Securities (or any of them), each of the Trust and the Corporation acknowledges and agrees that the Representative may, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, over-allot the Capital Securities (provided that the aggregate principal amount of the Capital Securities allotted does not exceed 105 per cent of the aggregate principal amount of the Capital Securities) or effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Capital Securities at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail.  However, there is no assurance that the Representative (or persons acting on behalf of the Representative) will undertake stabilization action.  Any stabilization action may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offer of the Capital Securities is made and, if begun, may be ended at any time, but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the date of issue of the Capital Securities and 60 days after the date of their allotment.  The Trust will not as a result of any action taken by the Representative (or persons acting on behalf of the Representative) under this provision be obliged to issue Capital Securities in excess of that listed in Schedule A hereto, nor shall the Trust or the Corporation be liable for any loss arising from the stabilization action.
       (e)            Each of the Trust and the Corporation authorizes each Underwriter to make all appropriate announcements in relation to any action in respect of the Capital Securities which falls within the definition of "stabilisation" and/or "ancillary stabilisation" set out in the Handbook published by U.K. Financial Services Authority (such announcements are to be in a form customarily utilized in the U.K. to comply with such requirements).
SECTION 3.  COVENANTS OF THE OFFERORS.  Each of the Offerors jointly and severally covenants with each Underwriter as follows:
        (a)            Prior to the termination of the offering of the Capital Securities, the Offerors will notify the Representative promptly, and confirm the notice in writing, (i) of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and any amendment thereto (including any posteffective amendment), (ii) of the filing of any supplement to the Final Prospectus or any document filed pursuant to the 1934 Act which will be incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus, (iii) of the receipt of any comments from the Commission with respect to the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus (other than with respect to a document filed with the Commission pursuant to the 1934 Act which will be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus), (iv) of any request by the Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Final Prospectus or for additional information relating thereto (other than such a request with respect to a document filed with the Commission pursuant to the 1934 Act which will be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus), and (v) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that
purpose.  The Offerors will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment.
          (b)            Prior to the termination of the offering of the Capital Securities, the Offerors (1) will give the Representative notice of their intention to file or prepare (i) any amendment to the Registration Statement (including any posteffective amendment) (other than with respect to a document filed with the Commission pursuant to the 1934 Act which will be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus that is not filed to correct a misstatement, an omission or non-compliance that is the subject of a notice delivered to the Underwriters pursuant to paragraph (e) below (a "Periodic Filing")), or (ii) any amendment or supplement to the Final Prospectus (including any revised prospectus which the Offerors propose for use by the Underwriters in connection with the offering of the Capital Securities which differs from the prospectus on file at the Commission at the time the Registration Statement became effective, whether or not such revised prospectus is required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations) (other than with respect to a Periodic Filing), will furnish the Representative with copies of any such amendment, supplement or other document within a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing or use, as the case may be, and will not file any such amendment, supplement or other document or use any such prospectus to which the Underwriters or counsel for the Underwriters shall reasonably object and (2) will furnish the Representative with copies of any document that will be incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus whether pursuant to the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or otherwise.  Subject to the foregoing, the Offerors will file the Final Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) and Rule 430A under the 1933 Act not later than the Commission's close of business on the second business day following the execution and delivery of this Agreement.
          (c)            The Offerors will deliver to the Representative as many signed copies of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein) as the Representative may reasonably request and will also deliver to the Representative a conformed copy of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto (without exhibits) for each of the Underwriters.
         (d)            The Offerors will furnish to each Underwriter, from time to time during the period when the Final Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act, such number of copies of the Final Prospectus (as amended or supplemented) as such Underwriter may reasonably request for the purposes contemplated by the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations.
        (e)            If at any time when the Final Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Capital Securities, except with respect to any such delivery requirement imposed upon an affiliate of the Offerors in connection with any secondary market sales, any event shall occur as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then amended or supplemented will include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend or supplement the Final Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations, the Offerors will, subject to paragraph (b) above, promptly prepare and file with the Commission such amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an
amendment which will effect such compliance, give immediate notice, and confirm in writing, to the Underwriters to cease the solicitation of offers to purchase the Capital Securities, and furnish to the Underwriters a reasonable number of copies of such amendment or supplement.
         (f)            The Offerors will endeavor, in cooperation with the Underwriters, to qualify the Capital Securities (and the Capital Securities Guarantee) and the Junior Subordinated Notes for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and the other jurisdictions of the United States as the Underwriters may designate; provided, however, that none of the Offerors shall be obligated to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified.
        (g)            The Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Underwriters as soon as practicable, but not later than 90 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement (which need not be audited) of the Company and its subsidiaries, covering an applicable period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the "Effective Date" (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the 1933 Act) of the Registration Statement, which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the 1933 Act.
       (h)            The Offerors will use reasonable efforts to effect the listing of the Capital Securities on the London Stock Exchange; if the Capital Securities are exchanged for Junior Subordinated Notes, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to effect the listing of the Junior Subordinated Notes on the exchange on which the Capital Securities were then listed.
       (i)            The Company, during the period when the Final Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act, will file promptly all documents required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act.
       (j)            Until the business day following the Closing Date, neither the Company nor the Trust will, without the consent of the Representatives, offer or sell, or announce the offering of, any additional securities covered by the Registration Statement or any other securities of the Company or any trust formed by the Company that are substantially similar to the Capital Securities.
        SECTION 4.    PAYMENT OF EXPENSES.  The Company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of each Offerors' obligations under this Agreement, and will pay:  (i) the printing and filing of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto, (ii) the copying of this Agreement, (iii) the preparation, issuance and delivery of the certificates for the Capital Securities, including capital duties, stamp duties and transfer taxes, if any, payable upon issuance of any of the Securities, the sale of the Securities, (iv) the fees and disbursements of the Company's and the Trust's counsel and accountants, (v) the qualification of the Capital Securities, the Capital Securities Guarantee and the Junior Subordinated Notes under applicable securities laws in accordance with the provisions of Section 3(f) hereof, including filing fees and the fees and disbursements of Morrison & Foerster LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, in connection therewith and in connection with the preparation of any blue sky survey, (vi) the printing and delivery to the Underwriters of copies of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto, of each preliminary prospectus, and of the

         If this Agreement is terminated by the Representative in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 or Section 7 hereof, the Company shall reimburse the Underwriters for all of their reasonable outofpocket expenses, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of Morrison & Foerster LLP, counsel for the Underwriters.
        SECTION 5.   CONDITIONS OF UNDERWRITERS' OBLIGATIONS.

reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters; and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent deemed proper, on the representations and warranties of the Offerors contained herein or in the Declaration, the Indenture, the Guarantee Agreements, that certain subscription agreement, of even date herewith, between the Company and the Trust covering the Common Securities and that certain note purchase agreement, of even date herewith, between the Company and the Trust, or on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and its subsidiaries and public officials.

                     In giving its opinion, Morrison & Foerster LLP may rely as to certain matters of (i) Delaware law upon the opinion of Richards, Layton & Finger P.A., counsel for the Offerors, which shall be delivered in accordance with Section 5(b)(2) hereto and (ii) North Carolina law upon the opinion of Helms Mulliss & Wicker, PLLC, which shall be delivered in accordance with Section 5(b)(1) hereto.

             (c)            At the Closing Time, there shall not have been, since the date hereof or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in the condition (financial or other), earnings, business or properties of the Trust
or the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth or contemplated in the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, and the Representative shall have received a certificate of any Senior Vice President or Treasurer or any other authorized officer of the Company and a certificate of a Regular Trustee of the Trust, and dated as of the Closing Time, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus and this Agreement and they are without knowledge that:  (i) there has been any material adverse change or any development involving a prospective material adverse change in the condition (financial or other), earnings, business or properties of the Trust or the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth or contemplated in the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, (ii) the representations and warranties in Section 1 hereof are not true and correct with the same force and effect as though expressly made at and as of the Closing Time, (iii) the Trust or the Company, as the case may be, has not performed or complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to the Closing Time, (iv) any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued or any proceedings for that purpose have been initiated or threatened by the Commission, and (v) any litigation or proceeding shall be threatened or pending to restrain or enjoin the issuance or delivery of the Capital Securities, or which in any way affects the validity of the Capital Securities.
           (d)            At the Closing Time, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representative a letter or letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to the Representative), dated as of the Closing Time, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representative, confirming that the response, if any, to Item 10 of the Registration Statement is correct insofar as it relates to them and stating in effect that:
                            (1)         They are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company within the meaning of the 1933 Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
                           (2)         In their opinion, the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries audited by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission.
                          (3)         On the basis of procedures (but not an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) consisting of:
                (i)            Reading the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, the board of directors, executive committee and audit committee of the Company and the board of directors of the Principal Subsidiary Bank as set forth in the minute books through a specified date not more than five business days prior to the date of delivery of such letter;
               (ii)            Performing the procedures specified by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for a review of interim financial information as described in Statement of Accounting Standards No. 100, Interim Financial Information, on the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus and reading the unaudited interim financial data, if any, for the period from the date of the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus to the date of the latest available interim financial data; and
              (iii)            Making inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters regarding the specific items for which representations are requested below;
          nothing has come to their attention as a result of the foregoing procedures that caused them to believe that:
             (a)            the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus, do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations thereunder;
            (b)            any material modifications should be made to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus, for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles;
            (c)            (i)  at the date of the latest available interim financial data and at the specified date not more than five business days prior to the date of the delivery of such letter, there was any change in the common stock or the consolidated long-term debt (other than scheduled repayments of such debt) of the Company and the subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as compared with the amounts shown in the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or (ii) for the period from the date of the latest available financial data to a specified date not more than five business days prior to the delivery of such letter, there was any change in the common stock or the consolidated long-term debt (other than scheduled repayments of such debt) of the Company and the subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, except in all instances for changes or decreases which the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur, or PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall state any specific changes or decreases.
          The letter shall also state that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has carried out certain other specified procedures, not constituting an audit, with respect to certain amounts, percentages and financial information which are included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus and which are specified by the Representative and agreed to by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, and has found such amounts, percentages and financial
information to be in agreement with the relevant accounting, financial and other records of the Company and its subsidiaries identified in such letter.
         (e)            Subsequent to the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in the immediate prior sub-section or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or other), earnings, business or properties of the Trust or the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as one enterprise, the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the judgment of the Representative, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Capital Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus.
         (f)            At the Closing Time, counsel for the Underwriters shall have been furnished with such documents and opinions as they may require for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon the issuance and sale of the Capital Securities as herein contemplated and related proceedings, or in order to evidence the accuracy of any of the representations or warranties, or the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained; and all proceedings taken by the Offerors, in connection with the issuance and sale of the Capital Securities as herein contemplated shall be satisfactory in form and substance to the Representative and Morrison & Foerster LLP, counsel for the Underwriters. 
        (g)            At the Closing Time, at least one "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the 1933 Act), has rated the Capital Securities in one of its four highest rating categories and (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any such nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities.
        (h)            There shall not have come to the Representative's attention any facts that would cause the Representative to believe that the Final Prospectus, at the time it was required to be delivered to a purchaser of the Securities, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances existing at the time of such delivery, not misleading.
At the Closing Time, the Capital Securities shall have been approved for (1) admission to the official list of the UK Listing Authority, and (2) admission for trading on the London Stock Exchange.
        (i)            In connection with the sale and purchase of the Capital Securities, if any condition specified in this Section with respect thereto shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as required to be fulfilled, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representative by notice to the Offerors, in writing or by telephone or telegraph confirmed in writing, at any time at or prior to the Closing Time and such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and except that Sections 1, 6, and 7 shall survive any such termination and will remain in full force and effect.
SECTION 6.            INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION
         (a)            The Offerors jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or arise out of or are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Final Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that (i) the Offerors will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Offerors by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arises out of or is based upon statements in or omissions from that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification of the Trustee (Form T-1) under the 1939 Act of any Trustee, and (ii) such indemnity with respect to the Basic Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter (or any person controlling such Underwriter) from whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the Capital Securities which are the subject thereof if such person did not receive a copy of the Final Prospectus (or the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented) excluding documents incorporated therein by reference at or prior to the confirmation of the sale of such Capital Securities to such person in any case where such delivery is required by the 1933 Act and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in any preliminary Final Prospectus was corrected in the Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Offerors may otherwise have.
           (b)            Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Trust, the Trustees, each of the Company's directors, each of the Company's officers who signs the Registration Statement and each of the Trustees who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company or the Trust within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Offerors to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Offerors by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereof.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability
which any Underwriter may otherwise have.  The Offerors acknowledge that (i) the names of the Underwriters and the statements required by Item 508 of Regulation S-K set forth in the language on the cover page or under the heading "Underwriting", (ii) the sentences relating to concessions and reallowances, and (iii) the paragraph related to stabilization and syndicate covering transactions in the Final Prospectus, constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, and the Representative confirms that such statements are correct.
           (c)            Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection.  In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties.  Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 6 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to local counsel), approved by the Representative in the case of subparagraph (a), representing the indemnified parties under subparagraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii).
         (d)            To provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) of this Section 6 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Offerors on the grounds of policy or otherwise, the Offerors and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Offerors and one or more of the
Underwriters may be subject in such proportion so that the Underwriters are responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the underwriting discount bears to the sum of such discount and the purchase price of the Securities specified in Schedule B hereto and the Offerors are responsible for the balance; provided, however, that (y) in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Capital Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount applicable to the Capital Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and (z) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 6, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls either of the Offerors within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, each officer or trustee of the Offerors who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director or trustee of the Offerors shall have the same rights to contribution as the Offerors, subject in each case to clause (y) of this paragraph (d).  Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d).
          (e)            The Company agrees to indemnify the Trust against all losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred by the Trust under Section 6(a) hereof.
          SECTION 7.   TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT.  This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representative, by notice given to the Offerors prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, or (ii) a banking moratorium or a material disruption in the commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities, or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or material escalation of hostilities or other calamity or crisis (in the United States or elsewhere) the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representative, impracticable to market the Securities.
         SECTION 8.  DEFAULT BY ONE OR MORE OF THE UNDERWRITERS.  If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Time to purchase the Capital Securities that it or they are obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), the Representative shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representative shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24hour period, then:
              (a)            if the number of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the Capital Securities each of the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not
jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or 
             (b)            if the number of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the Capital Securities, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any nondefaulting Underwriter. 
                       No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default. 
                       In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representative or the Offerors shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements. 
           SECTION 9.  NOTICES.  All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication.  Notices to the Underwriters shall be directed to them at Banc of America Securities Limited, 5 Canada Square, London E14 5AQ, England, Attn.:  Ian Harjette, with a copy to:  Morrison & Foerster LLP, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10105-0050, Attn.:  James R.

Campbell, Jr.
           SECTION 10.  PARTIES.  (a)  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Underwriters, the Trust, and the Company and their respective successors.  Nothing expressed or mentioned in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any person, firm or corporation, other than the Underwriters and the Trust and the Company and their respective successors and the controlling persons and officers, directors and trustees referred to in Section 6 and their heirs and legal representatives, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision herein contained.  This Agreement and all conditions and provisions hereof are intended to be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Underwriters and the Trust and the Company and their respective successors, and said controlling persons and officers, directors and trustees and their heirs and legal representatives, and for the benefit of no other person, firm or corporation.  No purchaser of Capital Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor by reason merely of such purchase. 
           (b)            Each of the Company and the Trust acknowledges and agrees that in connection with all aspects of the offering contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and the Trust shall be deemed to have an arms length business relationship with the Underwriters that creates no fiduciary duty on the part of the Underwriters with respect to the interests of Company and the
Trust.  Each of the Company and the Trust expressly disclaims the existence of any such fiduciary relationship resulting from the offering contemplated by this Agreement.
         SECTION 11.  GOVERNING LAW AND TIME.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements made and to be performed in said State.  Except as otherwise set forth herein, specified times of day refer to New York City time.
         SECTION 12.  COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
           If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding of our agreement, please sign and return to the Company and the Trust a counterpart hereof, whereupon this instrument, along with all counterparts, will become a binding agreement between the Underwriters and the Trust and the Company in accordance with its terms.

Interest.
           (a)        Each Note will bear interest at the rate of 5% per annum (the "Coupon Rate") from August 10, 2005 until the principal thereof becomes due and payable, and on any overdue principal and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at the Coupon Rate, compounded semi-annually,
payable (subject to the provisions of Article 4) semi-annually in arrears on February 10 and August 10 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing on February 10, 2006, to the Person in whose name such Note or any predecessor Note is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such interest installment, which, in respect of any Notes of which the Property Trustee is the Holder of a Global Note, shall be the close of business on the Business Day next preceding that Interest Payment Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if the Capital Securities are no longer in book-entry only form, the relevant record dates shall be the close of business on the January 15 and July 15 prior to the regular Interest Payment Date.

In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date.
         (c)        If, at any time while the Property Trustee is the Holder of any Notes, the Trust or the Property Trustee is required to pay any taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature (other than withholding taxes, as provided in subsection (d) below) imposed by the United States, or any other domestic taxing authority, then, in any case, the Company will pay as additional interest ("Additional Interest") on the Notes held by the Property Trustee, such additional amounts as shall be required so that the net amounts received and retained by the Trust and the Property Trustee after paying such taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges will be equal to the amounts the Trust and the Property Trustee would have received had no such taxes, duties, assessments or other government charges been imposed.
        (d)        Subject to the exemptions and limitations set forth below, the Company will pay additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") on the Notes with respect to any beneficial owner of the Capital Securities (or the Notes, following a liquidation of the Trust) that is a non-United States Person in order to ensure that every net payment on such Capital Securities (or Note, following such a liquidation) that it beneficially owns will not be less, due to payment of United States withholding tax, than the amount otherwise then due and payable.  The Company will not be obligated to make additional payments that exceed the amount required to do so.  For this purpose, a "net payment" on a Capital Security or a Note means a payment by the Trust, Company or any paying agent, including payment of principal and interest, after deduction for any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge of the United States.

(2)  having had such a relationship in the past; or
(3)  being considered as having had such a relationship.
                    (ii)        Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on a Capital Security or a Note, as applicable, is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely by reason of the beneficial owner:

                    (v)        Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on a Capital Security or a Note, as applicable, is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge
that is imposed or withheld solely by reason of the beneficial owner being a bank extending credit pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of business.

SECTION 4.1 Extension of Interest Payment Period.
                   The Company shall have the right, at any time and from time to time during the term of the Notes, to defer payments of interest and the related Additional Amounts by extending the interest payment period of such Notes for a period not exceeding 10 consecutive semi-annual periods (the "Extended Interest Payment Period"), during which Extended Interest Payment Period no interest shall be due and payable; no Extended Interest Payment Period may extend beyond the Maturity Date.

pursuant to this Section 4.1, will bear interest thereon at the Coupon Rate compounded semi-annually for each semi-annual period of the Extended Interest Payment Period ("Compounded Interest").  At the end of the Extended Interest Payment Period, the Company shall pay all interest accrued and unpaid on the Notes, including any Additional Interest and Compounded Interest (together, "Deferred Interest") that shall be payable to the Holders of the Notes in whose names the Notes are registered in the Security Register on the first record date after the end of the Extended Interest Payment Period.

Before the termination of any Extended Interest Payment Period, the Company may further extend such period, provided that such period together with all such previous and further extensions thereof shall not exceed 10 consecutive semi-annual periods, or extend beyond the Maturity Date of the Notes.  Upon the termination of any Extended Interest Payment Period and upon the payment of all Deferred Interest then due, the Company may commence a new Extended Interest Payment Period, subject to the foregoing requirements.  No interest shall be due and payable during an Extended Interest Payment Period, except at the end thereof, but the Company may prepay at any time all or any portion of the interest accrued during an Extended Interest Payment Period.
SECTION 4.2 Notice of Extension.
                       (a)        If the Property Trustee is the only registered Holder of the Notes at the time the Company selects an Extended Interest Payment Period, the Company shall give written notice to the Regular Trustees, the Property Trustee and the Trustee of its selection of such Extended Interest Payment Period at least one Business Day before the earlier of (i) the next succeeding date on which Distributions on the Trust Securities issued by the Trust are payable, or (ii) the date on which the Trust is required to give notice of the record date, or the date on which such Distributions are payable, to the London Stock Exchange or any other exchange upon which the Notes or Trust Securities may in the future be listed or any other applicable selfregulatory organization or to holders of the Capital Securities issued by the Trust, but in any event at least one Business Day before such record date.
                      (b)        If the Property Trustee is not the only Holder of the Notes at the time the Company selects an Extended Interest Payment Period, the Company shall give the Holders of the Notes and the Trustee written notice of its selection of such Extended Interest Payment Period at least 10 Business Days before the earlier of (i) the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, or (ii) the date the Company is required to give notice of the record or payment date of such interest payment to the London Stock Exchange or any other exchange upon which the Notes or Trust Securities may in the future be listed or any other applicable selfregulatory organization or to Holders of the Notes.
                    (c)        The semi-annual period in which any notice is given pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Section 4.2 shall be counted as one of the 10 consecutive semi-annual periods permitted in computing the maximum Extended Interest Payment Period permitted under Section 4.1.
SECTION 4.3 Limitation of Transactions. 
                   If (i) the Company shall exercise its right to defer payment of interest as provided in Section 4.1 and such Extended Interest Payment Period is continuing, or (ii) there shall have occurred and be continuing any Event of Default or Nonpayment, as defined in the Indenture, then (a) the Company shall not declare or pay any dividend on, make any distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock (other than (i) purchases or acquisitions of shares of its common stock in connection with the satisfaction by the Company of its obligations under any employee benefit plans, (ii) as a result of a reclassification of its capital stock or the exchange or conversion of one class or series of Company capital stock for another class or series of its capital stock or (iii) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of its capital stock pursuant to an acquisition or the conversion or exchange provisions of such capital stock or security being converted or exchanged) or make any guarantee payment with respect thereto and (b) the Company shall not make any payment of interest, principal or premium, if any, on or repay, repurchase or redeem any debt securities (including guarantees) issued by the Company which rank pari passu with or junior to the Notes.

                  (d)        pay any and all taxes and all liabilities, costs and expenses with respect to such taxes of the Trust.
SECTION 5.2 Payment Upon Resignation or Removal. 
                  Upon termination of this Seventh Supplemental Indenture or the Indenture or the removal or resignation of the Trustee, unless otherwise stated, the Company shall pay to the Trustee all amounts accrued to the date of such termination, removal or resignation.  Upon termination of the Declaration or the removal or resignation of the Delaware Trustee or the Property Trustee, as the case may be, pursuant to Section 5.7 of the Declaration, the Company shall pay to the Delaware Trustee or the Property Trustee, as the case may be, all amounts accrued to the date of such termination, removal or resignation.

BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "Company", which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to THE BANK OF NEW YORK, AS PROPERTY TRUSTEE OF BAC CAPITAL TRUST VII, or registered assigns, the principal sum of ____________________________________ POUNDS STERLING ( __________) on August 10, 2035 (the "Maturity Date"), and to pay interest on said principal sum from August 10, 2005 or from the most recent interest payment date (each such date, an "Interest Payment Date") to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually (subject to deferral as set forth herein) in arrears on February 10 and August 10 of each year commencing February 10, 2006, at the rate of 5% per annum until the principal hereof shall have become due and payable, and on any overdue principal and premium, if any, and (without duplication and to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at the same rate per annum, compounded semi-annually.

provided and (c) appoints the Trustee his or her attorneyinfact for any and all such purposes.  Each Holder hereof, by his or her acceptance hereof, hereby waives all notice of the acceptance of the subordination provisions contained herein and in the Indenture by each holder of Senior Obligations, whether now outstanding or hereafter incurred, and waives reliance by each such holder upon said provisions.

Dated:  August __, 2005                                                                                        The Bank of New York,                                                                                        as Trustee                                                                                        By                                                                                                      Authorized Signatory
                                                        
This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Notes of the Company (herein sometimes referred to as the "Notes"), specified in the Indenture, all issued or to be issued in one or more series under and pursuant to an Indenture dated as of November 1, 2001, duly executed and delivered between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the Seventh Supplemental Indenture dated as of August 10, 2005 (the "Seventh Supplemental Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee (the Indenture as so supplemented, the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Notes.  By the terms of the Indenture, the Notes are issuable in series that may vary as to amount, date of maturity, rate of interest and in other respects as provided in the Indenture.  This series of Notes is limited in aggregate principal amount as specified in the Seventh Supplemental Indenture.
Because of the occurrence and continuation of a Special Event, as defined in the Indenture, in certain circumstances, this Note may become due and payable at a prepayment price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be prepaid, or (b) as determined by the Quotation Agent (as defined in the Indenture), the present values of scheduled payments of principal and interest from the date of prepayment to August 10, 2035, on the Notes being prepaid, discounted to the date of prepayment on a semi-annual basis at a discount rate equal to the Bond Yield (as defined in the Indenture) plus a spread of 0.35% and, in the case of (a) or (b), any accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to, but excluding, the date of such prepayment (the "Special Event Prepayment Price"). However, in the case of a Tax Event resulting from the requirement to pay Additional Amounts described below, the Special Event Prepayment Price shall be limited to 100% of the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to, but excluding, the date of prepayment.  In addition, the Company shall have the right to prepay this Note at the option of the Company, in whole or in part at any time (an "Optional Prepayment"), at a prepayment price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be prepaid, or (b) as determined by the Quotation Agent (as defined in the Indenture), the present value of scheduled payments of principal and interest from the date of prepayment to August 10, 2035, on the Notes being prepaid, discounted to the date of prepayment on a semi-annual basis at a discount rate equal to the Bond Yield (as defined in the Indenture) plus a spread of 0.10% and, in the case of (a) or (b), any accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to but excluding the date of such prepayment (the "Optional Prepayment Price").  Any prepayment pursuant to this paragraph will be made upon not less than 30 days' nor more than 60 days' notice at the Optional Prepayment Price or the Special Event Prepayment Price, as applicable.  If the Notes are only partially prepaid by the Company pursuant to an Optional Prepayment, the Notes will be prepaid or by lot or by any other method utilized by the Trustee; if, at the time of prepayment, the Notes are registered as a Global Note, the Common Depository shall determine the principal amount of such Notes held by each Note holder to be prepaid through the applicable Clearing Agencies in accordance with its procedures.
pro
rata
provided
that
In the event of prepayment of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of this series for the portion hereof not prepaid will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
Subject to the exemptions and limitations set forth below, the Company will pay additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") to the beneficial owner of this Note with respect to any beneficial owner of the Capital Securities (or the Notes, following a liquidation of the Trust) that is a non-United States Person in order to ensure that every net payment on such Capital Securities (or Note, following such a liquidation) will not be less, due to payment of United States withholding tax, than the amount then due and payable, as provided in Section 2.5(d) of the Seventh Supplemental Indenture.
In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal of all of the Notes may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of each series affected at the time outstanding, as defined in the Indenture, to execute supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Notes; , , that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, without the consent of the Holder of each Note so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Notes, the Holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the Holders of each Note then outstanding and affected thereby.  The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of any series at the time outstanding affected thereby, on behalf of all of the Holders of the Notes of such series, to waive any past default in the performance of any of the covenants contained in the Indenture, or established pursuant to the Indenture with respect to such series, and its consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the registered Holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued in exchange herefor or in place hereof (whether by registration of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
provided
however
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on this Note at the time and place and at the rate and in the money herein prescribed.
The Company shall have the right at any time during the term of the Notes and from time to time to defer payment of interest by extending the interest payment period of such Notes for a period not exceeding 10 consecutive semi-annual periods (an "Extended Interest Payment Period"), at the end of which period the Company shall pay all interest then accrued and unpaid (together with interest thereon at the rate specified for the Notes to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law); no Extended Interest Payment Period may last beyond the Maturity Date of the Notes.  Before the termination of any such Extended Interest Payment Period, the Company may further extend such Extended Interest
provided
that
Payment Period, such Extended Interest Payment Period together with all such further extensions thereof shall not exceed 10 consecutive semi-annual periods or extend the Maturity Date of the Notes.  At the termination of any such Extended Interest Payment Period and upon the payment of all accrued and unpaid interest and any Additional Amounts then due, the Company may commence a new Extended Interest Payment Period, subject to the requirements contained in this paragraph.
provided
that
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Note is transferable by the registered Holder hereof on the Security Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Trustee in the City of London accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company or the Trustee duly executed by the registered Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount and series will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge will be made for any such transfer, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in relation thereto.
Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note, the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent and the Security Registrar may deem and treat the registered holder hereof as the absolute owner hereof (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing hereon made by anyone other than the Security Registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal hereof and premium, if any, and interest due hereon and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Security Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
[IF THE NOTES ARE ISSUED BY MEANS OF A BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM, INSERT THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE-The Notes are being issued by means of a book-entry system with no physical distribution of certificates to be made except as provided in the Indenture.  The book-entry system maintained by Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear System  ("Euroclear"), and Clearstream Banking, societe anonyme, Luxembourg ("Clearstream, Luxembourg") will evidence ownership of the Notes, with transfers of ownership effected on the records of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and their participants pursuant to rules and procedures established by Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and their participants.  The Company will recognize Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg as the owner of the Notes for all purposes, including payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest, notices, and voting.

Indenture, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, past, present or future, as such, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released.

SECTION 10.4     . 
Indemnification
(a)    (i)   The Note Issuer shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any Company Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Trust) by reason of the fact that he is or was a Company Indemnified Person against expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.  The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Company Indemnified Person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
nolo contendere
(ii)           The Note Issuer shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any Company Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Trust to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a Company Indemnified Person against expenses (including
attorneys' fees and expenses) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust and except that no such indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such Company Indemnified Person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Trust unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
(iii)          To the extent that a Company Indemnified Person shall be successful on the merits or otherwise (including dismissal of an action without prejudice or the settlement of an action without admission of liability) in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified, to the full extent permitted by law, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.
(iv)          Any indemnification under paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a) (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Note Issuer only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the Company Indemnified Person is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in paragraphs (i) and (ii).  Such determination shall be made (1) by the Regular Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of such Regular Trustees who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the Holders of the Common Securities.
(v)           Expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by a Company Indemnified Person in defending a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a) shall be paid by the Note Issuer in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Company Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Note Issuer as authorized in this Section 10.4(a).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance shall be made by the Note Issuer if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Regular Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees, (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iii) the Common Security Holder of the Trust, that, based upon the facts known to the Regular Trustees, counsel or the Common Security Holder at the time such determination is made, such Company Indemnified Person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such
 person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such Company Indemnified Person believed or had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.  In no event shall any advance be made in instances where the Regular Trustees, independent legal counsel or Common Security Holder reasonably determine that such person deliberately breached his duty to the Trust or to the Holders of the Common or Capital Securities.
(vi)          The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other paragraphs of this Section 10.4(a) shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification and advancement of expenses may be entitled under any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors of the Note Issuer or Capital Security Holders of the Trust or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.  All rights to indemnification under this Section 10.4(a) shall be deemed to be provided by a contract between the Note Issuer and each Company Indemnified Person who serves in such capacity at any time while this Section 10.4(a) is in effect.  Any repeal or modification of this Section 10.4(a) shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing.
(vii)         The Note Issuer or the Trust may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Company Indemnified Person against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Note Issuer would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Section 10.4(a).
(viii)         For purposes of this Section 10.4(a), references to "the Trust" shall include, in addition to the resulting or surviving entity, any constituent entity (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger, so that any person who is or was a director, trustee, officer or employee of such constituent entity, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent entity as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of another entity, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Section 10.4(a) with respect to the resulting or surviving entity as he would have with respect to such constituent entity if its separate existence had continued.
(ix)          The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Section 10.4(a) shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Company Indemnified Person and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
(b)           The Note Issuer agrees to indemnify the (i) Property Trustee, (ii) the Delaware Trustee, (iii) any Affiliate of the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, and (iv) any officers, directors, shareholders, members, partners, employees, representatives,
 custodians, nominees or agents of the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee (each of the Persons in (i) through (iv) being referred to as a "Fiduciary Indemnified Person") for, and to hold each Fiduciary Indemnified Person harmless against, any and all loss, liability, damage, claim or expense including taxes (other than taxes based on the income of such Fiduciary Indemnified Person) incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the trust or trusts hereunder, including the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) of defending itself against or investigating any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder.

Distributions
(a)        Distributions payable on each Security will be fixed at a rate per annum of 5%  (the "Coupon Rate") of the stated liquidation amount of  50,000 per Security, such rate being the interest rate payable on the Notes to be held by the Property Trustee.  Distributions in arrears for more than one semi-annual period will bear interest thereon compounded semi-annually at the Coupon Rate (to the extent permitted by applicable law).  A Distribution is payable only to the extent that payments are made in respect of the Notes held by the Property Trustee and to the extent the Property Trustee has funds available therefor.

As a consequence of such deferral, Distributions also will be deferred on the Capital Securities for the same period.  Despite such deferral, semi-annual Distributions will continue to accrue with interest thereon (to the extent permitted by applicable law) at the Coupon Rate compounded semi-annually during any such Extension Period.  Prior to the termination of any such Extension Period, the Note Issuer may extend further such Extension Period; such Extension Period together with all such previous and further extensions thereof may not exceed 10 consecutive semi-annual periods or extend beyond the Stated Maturity.  Payments of accrued Distributions will be payable to Holders as they appear on the books and records of the Trust or the applicable Clearing Agency, as the case may be, on the first record date after the end of the Extension Period.  Upon the termination of any Extension Period and the payment of all amounts then due, the Note Issuer may commence a new Extension Period, subject to the above requirements.  No interest shall be due and payable during an Extension Period, except at the end thereof, but the Note Issuer may repay at any time all or any portion of the interest accrued during an Extension Period.  If any Additional Amounts are required to be paid on the accrued Distributions, those Additional Amounts will only be paid at the time the Distributions are paid.

(c)        Distributions on the Securities will be payable to the Holders thereof as they appear on the books and records of the Trust on the relevant record dates.  While the Capital Securities remain in BookEntry only form, the relevant record dates shall be one Business Day prior to the relevant payment dates, which payment dates correspond to the interest payment dates on the Notes.  Payment of Distributions on the Securities held in Book-Entry only form will be made to the Common Depository in immediately available funds for delivery to the applicable Clearing Agency.  Each Clearing Agency will credit the accounts of the Clearing Agency Participants on the relevant payment date in accordance with their respective standard procedures, which could change at any time.  Payments by (i) Clearing Agency Participants and (ii) securities brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies and other entities that clear transactions through or maintain a direct or indirect custodial relationship with a Clearing Agency Participant (an "Indirect Participant") to Capital Security Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of such Clearing Agency Participants and Indirect Participants and not of the Common Depository, the Clearing Agency, the Trust or the Company, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.  Payment of distributions to the Common Depository for remittance to the applicable Clearing Agency is the responsibility of the Trust, disbursement of such payments to Clearing Agency Participants is the responsibility of the applicable Clearing Agency, and disbursement of such payments to the Capital Security Beneficial Owners is the responsibility of the Clearing Agency Participants and Indirect Participants.  The relevant record dates for the Common Securities shall be the same record date as for the Capital Securities.  If the Capital Securities shall no longer remain in BookEntry only form, the regular record dates for the Capital Securities shall be the close of business on the January 15 and July 15 prior to the
relevant payment dates, which payment dates correspond to the interest payment dates on the Notes.  Distributions payable on any Securities that are not punctually paid on any Distribution payment date, as a result of the Note Issuer having failed to make a payment under the Notes, will cease to be payable to the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the relevant record date, and such defaulted Distribution will instead be payable to the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the special record date or other specified date determined in accordance with the Indenture.  If any date on which Distributions are payable on the Securities is not a Business Day, then payment of the Distribution payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date.

Liquidation Distribution Upon Dissolution
In the event of any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, winding-up or termination of the Trust, the Holders on the date of the dissolution, winding-up or termination, as the case may be, will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Trust available for distribution to Holders after satisfaction of liabilities of creditors an amount equal to the aggregate of the stated liquidation amount of  50,000 per Security plus accrued and unpaid Distributions thereon to the date of payment (such amount being the "Liquidation Distribution"), unless, in connection with such dissolution, windingup or termination, Notes in an aggregate stated principal amount equal to the aggregate stated liquidation amount of such Securities, with an interest rate equal to the Coupon Rate of, and bearing accrued and unpaid interest in an amount equal to the accrued and unpaid Distributions on, such Securities, shall be distributed on a Pro Rata basis to the Holders of the Securities in exchange for such Securities.
If, upon any such dissolution, the Liquidation Distribution can be paid only in part because the Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then the amounts payable directly by the Trust on the Securities shall be paid on a Pro Rata basis.  Holders of the Common Securities will be entitled to receive distributions upon any such dissolution Pro Rata with Holders of the Capital Securities, except that if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Capital Securities shall have a preference over the Common Securities with respect to such distributions.

Redemption and Distribution
(a)        The Securities are subject to redemption at the Stated Maturity and prior to the Stated Maturity, in whole or in part, on one or more occasions, at any time at the election of the Sponsor or in whole, but not in part, in certain circumstances, following the occurrence of a Special Event as follows:
(i)         Upon payment of the Notes at a payment price equal to the principal amount of the Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon at the Stated Maturity, the proceeds from such payment shall be applied simultaneously to redeem the Securities at the Maturity Redemption Price.
(ii)        In the event of a Special Event Prepayment, the proceeds from such Special Event Prepayment shall be applied simultaneously to redeem the Capital Securities at the Special Event Redemption Price.
(iii)       The Securities also may be redeemed, in whole or in part, contemporaneously with an optional prepayment of the Notes at the Optional Redemption Price.  If fewer than all the outstanding Securities are to be so redeemed, the Common Securities and the Capital Securities will be redeemed Pro Rata and the Capital Securities to be redeemed will be as described in Section 4(d)(ii) below.
(b)        If the Sponsor has given a notice of its election to terminate the Trust, the Regular Trustees shall dissolve the Trust and, after satisfaction of creditors, cause Notes held by the Property Trustee, having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate stated liquidation amount of the Securities, with an interest rate equal to the Coupon Rate of, and bearing accrued and unpaid interest in an amount equal to the accrued and unpaid Distributions on, and having the same record date for payment as, the Securities, to be distributed to the Holders of the Securities in liquidation of such Holders' interests in the Securities within 90 days following receipt of the Sponsor's notice of election.
(c)        On and from the date fixed by the Regular Trustees for any distribution of Notes and dissolution of the Trust:  (i) the Securities will no longer be deemed to be outstanding, (ii) the Common Depository or its nominee as the record Holder of the Capital Securities, will receive a registered Global Security or Securities representing the Notes to be delivered upon such distribution and any certificates representing Securities, except for certificates representing Capital Securities held by the Common Depository or its nominee (or any successor Common Depository or its nominee), will be deemed to represent beneficial interests in the Notes having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate stated liquidation amount of, with an identical interest rate, and accrued and unpaid interest equal to accrued and unpaid Distributions on such Securities until such certificates are presented to the Note Issuer or its agent for transfer or reissue.  The Trust may not redeem fewer than all the outstanding Securities unless all accrued and unpaid Distributions have been paid on all Securities for all semi-annual Distribution periods terminating on or before the date of redemption.  If the Notes are distributed to holders of the Securities, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Note Issuer will use its best efforts to have the Notes listed on the securities exchange, if any, on which the Capital Securities were listed immediately prior to the distribution of the Notes.
(d)        Redemption or Distribution Procedures shall be as follows:
(i)         A Redemption/Distribution Notice for the Securities to be redeemed or exchanged will be given by the Trust by mail to each Holder not fewer than 15 nor more than 60 days before the redemption date or exchange date which, in the case of a redemption, will be the date fixed for redemption of the Notes.  For purposes of the
calculation of the redemption date or exchange date and the dates on which notices are given pursuant to this Section 4(d)(i), a Redemption/ Distribution Notice shall be deemed to be given on the day such notice is first mailed by firstclass mail, postage prepaid, to Holders of Securities.  Each Redemption/Distribution Notice shall be addressed to the Holders of Securities at the address of each such Holder appearing in the books and records of the Trust.  No defect in the Redemption/Distribution Notice or in the mailing of either with respect to any Holder shall affect the validity of the redemption or exchange proceedings with respect to any other Holder.
(ii)        In the event that fewer than all the outstanding Securities are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be redeemed Pro Rata from each Holder of Capital Securities, it being understood that, in respect of Capital Securities registered in the name of and held of record by the Common Depository or its nominee (or any successor Common Depository or its nominee) or any nominee, the distribution of the redemption proceeds will be made to each Clearing Agency for further distribution to each Clearing Agency Participant (or Person on whose behalf such nominee holds such securities) in accordance with the procedures applied by such agency or nominee.
(iii)       If Securities are to be redeemed and the Trust gives a Redemption/Distribution Notice, which notice may only be issued if the Notes are repaid as set out in this Section 4 (which notice will be irrevocable), then (A) while the Capital Securities are in Book-Entry only form, with respect to the Capital Securities, on the redemption date, provided that the Note Issuer has paid the Property Trustee a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the related prepayment or maturity of the Notes, the Property Trustee will deposit irrevocably with the Common Depository or its nominee (or successor Common Depository or its nominee) for delivery to the applicable Clearing Agency funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price with respect to the Capital Securities and will give the Common Depository irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price through the applicable Clearing Agency to the Holders of the Capital Securities, and (B) with respect to Capital Securities issued in definitive form and Common Securities, the Note Issuer has paid the Property Trustee a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the related prepayment or maturity of the Notes, the Property Trustee will pay the relevant Redemption Price to the Holders of such Securities by check mailed to the address of the relevant Holder appearing on the books and records of the Trust on the redemption date.  If a Redemption/Distribution Notice shall have been given and funds deposited as required, if applicable, then immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such deposit, or on the redemption date, as applicable, Distributions will cease to accrue on the Securities so called for redemption and all rights of Holders of such Securities so called for redemption will cease, except the right of the Holders of such Securities to receive the Redemption Price, but without interest on such Redemption Price.  Neither the Regular Trustees nor the Trust shall be required to register or cause to be registered the transfer of any Securities that have been so called for redemption.  If any date fixed for redemption of Securities is not a Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day falls in the next calendar year, such payment will be made on the immediately                                                                                               I-5

(iv)       Redemption/Distribution Notices shall be sent by the Regular Trustees on behalf of the Trust to (A) in respect of the Capital Securities,the Common Depository or its nominee (or any successor Common Depository or its nominee) for delivery to the applicable Clearing Agency if the Global Securities have been issued or, if Definitive Capital Security Certificates have been issued, to the Holder thereof, and (B) in respect of the Common Securities to the Holder thereof.

Distributions payable on each Capital Security will be fixed at a rate per annum of 5-1/4%  (the "Coupon Rate") of the stated liquidation amount of  50,000 per Capital Security, such rate being the rate of interest payable on the Notes to be held by the Property Trustee on behalf of the Trust.  Distributions in arrears for more than one semi-annual period will bear interest thereon compounded semi-annually at the Coupon Rate (to the extent permitted by applicable law).  A Distribution is payable only to the extent that payments are made in respect of the Notes held by the Property Trustee and to the extent the Property Trustee has funds available therefor.  The amount of Distributions payable for any period, including for any period shorter than a full semi-annual period, will be computed using a day count fraction of the actual number of days in the period divided by 365 or 366, as applicable.
Except as otherwise described below, Distributions on the Capital Securities will be cumulative, will accrue from the date of original issuance and will be payable semi-annually in arrears on February 10 and August 10 of each year, commencing on February 10, 2006, to the person in whose name the Capital Security is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such installment, which shall be the close of business on the Business Day next preceding such payment date - [IF PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE DECLARATION, THE SECURITIES ARE NO LONGER REPRESENTED BY A GLOBAL SECURITY - which shall be the close of business on January 15 and July 15 prior to the relevant payment date.]  The Note Issuer has the right under the Indenture to defer payments of interest by extending the interest payment period from time to time on the Notes for a period not exceeding 10 consecutive semi-annual periods (each an "Extension Period"), no Extension Period shall last beyond the date of the maturity of the Notes.  As a consequence of such deferral, Distributions will also be deferred hereunder for the same period.  Despite such deferral, semi-annual Distributions will continue to accrue with interest thereon (to the extent permitted by applicable law) at the Coupon Rate compounded semi-annually during any such Extension Period. Prior to the termination of any such Extension Period, the Note Issuer may further extend such Extension Period; such Extension Period together with all such previous and further extensions thereof may not exceed 10 consecutive semi-annual periods or extend beyond the maturity date of the Notes.  Payments of accrued Distributions will be payable to Holders as they appear on the books and records of the Trust on the first record date after the end of the Extension Period.  Upon the termination of any Extension Period and the payment of all amounts then due, the Note Issuer may commence a new Extension Period, subject to the above requirements.

Distributions and payment of principal will generally be made in pounds sterling, or any successor currency of the United Kingdom. If pounds sterling, or any successor currency of the United Kingdom, are not available to the Company or the Trust due to circumstances beyond the control of the Company or the Trust (such as the imposition of exchange controls or a disruption in the currency markets), the Company and the Trust are entitled to satisfy their obligations to make the payments on the Capital Securities and the Notes in pounds sterling, or any successor currency of the United Kingdom, by instead making the payments in U.S. dollars on the basis of the exchange rate determined by the Exchange Rate Agent (as defined in the Indenture) in its sole discretion.
The Property Trustee will make additional Distributions on the Capital Securities to any beneficial owner of the Capital Securities that is a non-United States Person (as defined in the Indenture) in order to ensure that every net payment on such Capital Securities will not be less, due to payment of United States withholding tax, than the amount otherwise then due and payable. The Property Trustee will not be obligated to make additional payments that exceed the amount required to do so. For this purpose, a "net payment" on a Capital Security means a payment by the Trust or any paying agent, including payment of principal and interest, after deduction for any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge of the United States.  Such additional Distributions are only required to be paid to the extent that the Company is required to pay "Additional Amounts" (as defined in the Indenture) under the Notes pursuant to Section 2.5(d) of the supplemental indenture relating to the Notes with respect to such beneficial owner, and then only to the extent that such payments are made in respect of the Notes held by the Property Trustee and to the extent the Property Trustee has funds available therefor.  
The Capital Securities are being issued by means of a book-entry system with no physical distribution of certificates to be made except as provided in the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust.  The book-entry system maintained by Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear System  ("Euroclear"), and Clearstream Banking, societe anonyme, Luxembourg ("Clearstream, Luxembourg") will evidence ownership of the Capital Securities, with transfers of ownership effected on the records of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and their participants pursuant to rules and procedures established by Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and their participants.  The Trust will recognize Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg as the owner of the Capital Securities for all purposes, including payment of Distributions, principal, premium, if any, and notices and voting.
Transfers of the Capital Securities will be effected through the facilities of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, in accordance with the rules and procedures established by those clearing agencies.  The Trust has no responsibility for any aspect of the records kept by Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg or any of their direct or indirect participants.  The Trust does not supervise these systems in any way.
THE CAPITAL SECURITIES SHALL BE REDEEMABLE AS PROVIDED IN THE DECLARATION.
