CHARLOTTE  Bank of America Corporation today reported that third quarter net income rose 10 percent to $4.13 billion from $3.76 billion a year earlier. Per share earnings increased 12 percent to $1.02 per share (diluted) from, $0.91 per share. Return on average common equity in the third quarter was 16.33 percent.
 
Excluding merger and restructuring charges of $120 million pre-tax, equal to 2 cents per share, the company earned $1.04 per share.
 
Improved results were driven by a 16 percent increase in revenue, reflecting continued success in growth initiatives in all of Bank of America's major business segments. Revenue growth was driven primarily by increases in noninterest income, including continued strength in card results, service fees, a rebound in mortgage banking income, improved trading account profits and higher equity investment gains.
 
The growth in revenue, coupled with a 4 percent increase in noninterest expense, produced significant positive operating leverage of 12 percentage points.
 
For the first nine months of 2005, Bank of America earned $13.12 billion, or $3.22 per share (diluted), compared to $10.29 billion, or $2.76 per share, a year earlier.
 
"We had across the board increases in the business segments that make up our total revenue," said Kenneth D. Lewis, chairman and chief executive officer. "This is a tribute to the power and balance of our franchise, the talent and energy of our associates and the continued improvements to the customer experience using Six Sigma and other processes. Combined with continued excellent expense control, we continue to produce significant positive operating leverage that is producing value for our shareholders."

Third Quarter 2005 Financial Summary
 
Revenue
 
Revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis grew 16 percent to $14.81 billion from $12.76 billion the previous year.
 
Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was $7.97 billion, up almost 2 percent from $7.84 billion a year earlier, as the impact of continued success in growing loans and deposits was dampened by continued relatively low long-term interest rates and a flatter yield curve. Specifically, the increase in net interest income was driven by growth in consumer and middle-market business loans, higher domestic deposit levels, and a larger asset-liability management portfolio. These increases were partially offset by margin compression resulting from a flattening yield curve and a lower trading-related net interest income contribution. Net interest income was up almost 2 percent from the second quarter of 2005. The net interest yield in the third quarter was 2.80 percent, down 1 basis point from the second quarter and 50 basis points from a year earlier.
 
Noninterest income rose 39 percent to $6.83 billion from $4.92 billion a year earlier. These results were driven by higher card income, equity investment gains and trading account profits. Mortgage banking income rebounded from a $250 million loss the previous year related to writedowns associated with mortgage servicing rights.
 
During the quarter, the company realized $29 million in debt securities gains compared to $732 million in the third quarter of 2004.
 
Efficiency
 
With strong revenue growth and continued expense control, the efficiency ratio for the third quarter of 2005, including merger and restructuring charges, improved to 49.20 percent (48.39 percent excluding merger and restructuring charges). Noninterest expense increased 4 percent to $7.29 billion compared to $7.02 billion a year ago, due primarily to increases in revenue-related incentive compensation resulting from improved performance. Full year 2005 cost savings from the merger with FleetBoston Financial Corporation are estimated to be $1.85 billion.

Credit Quality
 
Credit quality was generally stable, however the rate of improvement in commercial credit quality slowed. Charge-offs and provision expense rose. The company took $209 million in previously-reserved-for charge-offs associated with the domestic airline industry. Consumer loan reserves increased, reflecting growth and seasoning in the credit card portfolio including returning securitizations. A $50 million reserve was established for estimated losses associated with Hurricane Katrina.
 
 
 
 
 
Capital Management
 
Total shareholders' equity was $101.3 billion at September 30, 2005. Period-end assets grew to $1.25 trillion. The Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 8.21 percent, compared to 8.06 percent at June 30, 2005 and 8.08 percent a year ago.
 
During the quarter, Bank of America paid a cash dividend of $0.50 per share. The company also issued 7.0 million shares, primarily related to employee stock options and ownership plans, and repurchased 10.6 million shares. Period-ending common shares issued and outstanding were 4.01 billion in the third quarter, compared to 4.02 billion in the second quarter of 2005 and 4.05 billion in the third quarter of 2004.

Third Quarter 2005 Business Segment Results
 
Global Consumer and Small Business Banking
 
 
 
 
Continued strong growth in the card business, significant increases in home equity loans, a rebound in mortgage banking, and continuing account growth which has led to market share gains in retail deposits, drove Global Consumer and Small Business Banking's 25 percent increase in net income. Revenue rose 12 percent.
 
Card income rose more than 21 percent to $1.4 billion as a result of increased customer activity, growth in managed outstandings and the impact of the National Processing Corporation acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2004. Provision expense increased primarily due to higher card charge-offs resulting from growth and seasoning of the portfolio.
 
The bank's mortgage unit benefited from an improved interest rate environment in the quarter along with a reduced cost structure for originating and servicing first mortgages and home equity loans. Average outstandings on home equity loans across all business units increased 31 percent to $65.7 billion from the third quarter of 2004. Results were significantly better than a year ago, primarily due to a writedown of mortgage servicing rights in the third quarter of 2004.

Global Business and Financial Services
 
 
 
 
Global Business and Financial Services benefited in the quarter from continued strong loan growth across all business lines, including the purchase of loans from General Motors Acceptance Corporation. Net income declined as provision expense increased. Revenue grew more than 13 percent.
 
Average loans and leases in Global Business and Financial Services grew more than $19 billion from the third quarter of 2004, or 12 percent, as commercial activity continued to increase. Middle market business loans and leases grew more than 10 percent with strong growth across all geographic regions.
 
Revenue growth was driven by strong net interest income on loans and deposits in Commercial Real Estate and Business Banking.
 
Provision expense increased $315 million, primarily due to a slower rate of improvement in commercial credit quality and higher net charge-offs.

Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking
 
 
 
 
Strong trading results and increased market share gains in investment banking for Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking drove revenue 12 percent higher. Net income declined as provision increased and expenses rose as the company continued to invest in the business.
 
Trading-related results benefited from increased profits in fixed income, equities, interest rate and foreign exchange products.
 
Investment banking income was up 17 percent, driven by increased activity in equity underwriting and advisory services.
 
During the quarter, Banc of America Securities achieved significant gains in market share as tabulated by Thomson Financial. Year-to-date, the unit increased its market share in underwriting investment grade debt to 8 percent and rose in rankings to 4th from 8th for the first nine months of 2004. Banc of America Securities maintained its number one ranking in high yield debt underwriting for the year, and maintained top five underwriting rankings in syndicated loans, leveraged loans, and mortgage-backed securities.

Global Wealth and Investment Management
 
 
 
 
Global Wealth and Investment Management increased net income by 22 percent from third quarter 2004 as increased asset management fees, higher loan volume and migration of deposits to Premier Banking from Consumer Banking drove results.
 
Asset management fees increased 7 percent from the third quarter of 2004 as the unit experienced 6 percent growth in assets under management. Growth in assets under management was mainly due to net inflows of $3.6 billion and the positive impact of $24.2 billion in increased market values.
 
Sales of brokerage services to Premier clients, the mass affluent sector, continued to grow, with 30 percent currently using these investment services in addition to banking products, up from 25 percent at the end of 2004.
 
All Other
 
All Other reflected $124 million of net income for the quarter, the same as the third quarter of 2004. Equity Investment gains were $564 million in the third quarter of 2005 compared to $182 million in the third quarter of 2004. All Other also included debt securities gains related to asset/liability management of $13 million, compared to $614 million in the third quarter of 2004.

Reconciliation to GAAP financial measures
 
Supplemental financial data presented on an operating basis is a basis of presentation not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) that excludes merger and restructuring charges. We believe that the exclusion of merger and restructuring charges, which represent events outside our normal operations, provides a meaningful period-to-period comparison and is more reflective of normalized operations.
 
Shareholder value added (SVA) is a key measure of performance not defined by GAAP that is used in managing our growth strategy orientation and strengthening our focus on generating long-term growth and shareholder value. SVA is used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity (i.e. capital) at the individual unit level and is an integral component in the analytics for resource allocation. Using SVA as a performance measure places specific focus on whether incremental investments generate returns in excess of the costs of capital associated with those investments. Each business segment has a goal for growth in SVA reflecting the individual segment's business and customer strategy.
 
Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. See the Tables below for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the quarters ended September 30, 2005, June 30, 2005, March 31, 2005, December 31, 2004 and September 30, 2004, and the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004.
