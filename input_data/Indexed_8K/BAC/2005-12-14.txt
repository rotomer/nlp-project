On December 13, 2005, upon the recommendation of its Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Bank of America Corporation ("Bank of America") approved changes to Bank of America's nonemployee director compensation arrangements. These changes will be effective as of Bank of America's Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on April 26, 2006.
 
Specifically, nonemployee directors will receive an annual cash award in the amount of $80,000 and an annual restricted stock award in the amount of $160,000. Previously, nonemployee directors received an annual retainer in the amount of $100,000, of which $60,000 was paid in cash and $40,000 was paid in restricted stock, as well as an additional award of restricted stock valued at $80,500. Bank of America also will cease providing meeting fees to nonemployee directors. Previously, nonemployee directors received an attendance fee of $1,500 for each meeting of the Board or committee of the Board. The annual cash retainer for the Audit Committee chairperson was increased from $20,000 to $30,000. The annual cash retainer for the other committee chairpersons remains at $20,000.
 
The annual restricted stock award will continue to be provided under the Bank of America Corporation Directors' Stock Plan (the "Directors' Stock Plan") and will continue to be subject to a one-year vesting period. Nonemployee directors also will continue to be eligible to defer all of their compensation under the Bank of America Director Deferral Plan.
 
The Board also approved amendments to the Directors' Stock Plan to reflect the changes to the nonemployee director compensation arrangements described above.
 
A summary of the nonemployee director compensation arrangements described above is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference, and the Amended and Restated Directors' Stock Plan is attached as Exhibit 10.2 to this Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
On December 13, 2005, the Board elected General Tommy Franks as a member of the Board, effective January 25, 2006. General Franks was also appointed to serve on the Audit Committee, effective January 25, 2006. Information regarding any related party transactions between General Franks or any of his immediate family and Bank of America is not available at this time, and Bank of America will file an amendment to this Form 8-K at such time as such information becomes available.
 
 
On December 13, 2005, the Board approved an amendment to Bank of America's Bylaws, effective December 13, 2005, providing that the provisions of the Bylaws regarding the right to indemnification shall supercede any conflicting provisions contained in the corporate governance documents of any affiliate of Bank of America. Previously, the Bylaws provided that the right to indemnification set forth in the Bylaws did not apply to any director, officer, manager or
 
employee of any affiliate with corporate governance documents which included their own indemnification provisions.
 
A copy of Bank of America's Amended Bylaws is being filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Notice to Stockholders
 
by which the Stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Any notice to Stockholders shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder in the manner and to the extent permitted by the DGCL.
 
The written notice of any meeting shall be given not less than ten nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each Stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice may be given to stockholders sharing an address in the manner and to the extent permitted by the DGCL. If mailed, notice is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the Stockholder at such Stockholder's address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.
 
When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place of the adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each Stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting.

When a determination of Stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of Stockholders has been made as provided in this section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record date.
Fixing of Record Date
 
Section 6. . The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten days before the meeting of Stockholders, a complete list of the Stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each Stockholder and the number of Shares registered in the name of each Stockholder. The list of Stockholders shall be open to the examination of any Stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation, or the Corporation may place the
Stockholders List
 
Stockholder's list on a reasonably accessible electronic network as permitted by the DGCL. The list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting and be available for inspection by any Stockholder who is present at the meeting.
 
Section 7. . A majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of Stockholders. Where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is required, a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the outstanding shares of such class or series or classes or series, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. In the absence of a quorum, such meeting may be adjourned from time to time by the approval of the majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares present and entitled to vote at the meeting, even if less than a quorum. Once a quorum is present at a meeting, it is deemed present for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough Stockholders to leave less than a quorum.
Quorum
 
Section 8. . Each Stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of Stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such Stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.
Proxies
 
Without limiting the manner in which a Stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such Stockholder as proxy pursuant to the previous paragraph, the following shall constitute a valid means by which a Stockholder may grant such authority:
 
(1) A Stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for such Stockholder as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by the Stockholder or such Stockholder's authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or causing such person's signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature.
 
(2) A Stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such Stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the Stockholder. If it is determined that such telegrams, cablegrams or other electronic transmissions
 
are valid, the inspectors or, if there are no inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall specify the information upon which they relied.
 
Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to the previous paragraph of this section may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.
 
A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation generally.
 
Section 9. . Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, each outstanding share of Common Stock is entitled to one vote on each matter voted on at a Stockholders meeting. Other Shares are entitled to vote only as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL. If a quorum exists, action on a matter (other than election of directors or the Chairman of a meeting) is approved if the votes cast favoring an action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless the Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL requires a greater number of affirmative votes. Where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is required, the approval of the majority of the votes entitled to be cast within such class or series or classes or series present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class or series or classes or series. Such class or series or classes or series shall not be entitled to vote separately unless expressly required by the Certificate of Incorporation or as otherwise provided in the DGCL.
Voting of Shares
 
Section 10. . The directors of the Corporation shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the Shares entitled to vote in the election at the meeting at which a quorum is present unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation.
Voting for Directors
 
Section 11. . The Chairman of the Board shall preside as chairman at each meeting of Stockholders or, in the Chairman's absence, the Chief Executive Officer shall so preside. At the request of the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer, in both their absences, such other officer as the Board of Directors shall designate shall so preside at any such meeting. In the absence of a presiding officer determined in accordance with the preceding sentence, any person may be designated to so preside at a Stockholders meeting by a plurality vote of the Shares represented and entitled to vote at the meeting. The Secretary or, in the absence or at the request of the Secretary, any person designated by the person presiding at a Stockholders meeting shall act as secretary of such meeting. The chairman of any meeting of Stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting,
Conduct of Meetings
 
including regulation of the manner of voting, the conduct of discussion, and the propriety of any proposal brought before the meeting. The date and time of the opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which the Stockholders will vote at the meeting shall be announced at the meeting.
 
Section 12. At any meeting of the stockholders, only business that has been properly brought before the meeting may be conducted. Nominations for the election of directors and the proposal of other business at an annual meeting may be made only: (a) pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting; (b) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors; or (c) by a stockholder entitled to vote who complies with this Section 12.
Notice of Stockholder Business and Nominations.
 
A notice of the intent of a stockholder to make a nomination or to bring any other matter before the annual meeting shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the seventy-fifth day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to the first anniversary of the date the Corporation commenced mailing its proxy materials for the preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty days before or more than seventy days after its anniversary date, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the seventy-fifth day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation). In the event of a special meeting at which directors are to be elected, any stockholder entitled to vote may nominate a person or persons for election as director if the stockholder's notice is received by the Secretary of the Corporation not later than the close of the fifteenth day following the day on which notice of the meeting is first mailed to stockholders.
 
Any notice by a stockholder shall set forth:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notice of intent to make a nomination shall be accompanied by the written consent of each nominee to serve as director of the Corporation if so elected.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 12, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 12. Nothing in this Section 12 shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.
 
 
 
Section 1. . The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed under the direction of its Board of Directors, except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or permitted under the DGCL.

Directors need not be residents of the State of Delaware or Stockholders of the Corporation. A director of the Corporation shall at all times meet all statutory and regulatory qualifications for a director of a publicly held bank holding company and financial holding company.
Number and Qualifications
 
Section 3. . The terms of all directors shall expire at the next annual Stockholders meeting following their election. A decrease in the number of directors does not shorten an incumbent director's term. The term of a director elected to fill a vacancy shall expire at the next Stockholders meeting at which directors are elected. Despite the expiration of a director's term, however, such director shall continue to serve until the director's successor is elected and qualified or until such director's earlier resignation or removal.
Terms of Directors
 
Any director may be removed at any time with or without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding Shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.
 
Section 4. . Except in those instances where the Certificate of Incorporation or applicable law provides otherwise, a majority of directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or a sole remaining director, may fill a vacancy or a newly created directorship on the Board of Directors. A vacancy that will occur at a specific later date (by reason of a resignation effective at a later date or otherwise) may be filled before the vacancy occurs by a majority of directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, but the new director may not take office until the vacancy occurs.
Vacancies and Newly Created Directorships
 
Section 5. . The Board of Directors may provide for the compensation of directors for their services as such and may provide for the payment or reimbursement of any or all expenses reasonably incurred by them in attending meetings of the Board or of any committee of the Board or in the performance of their other duties as directors. Nothing herein contained, however, shall prevent any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity or receiving compensation therefor.
Compensation
 
Section 6. . The Board of Directors may designate five or more directors who shall constitute the Executive Committee of the Corporation. The Executive Committee, between meetings of the Board of Directors and subject to such limitations as may be required by law or imposed by resolution of the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise all of the authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the Corporation.
Executive Committee
 
Meetings of the Executive Committee may be held at any time on call of its Chairman or any two members of the Committee. A majority of the members shall constitute a quorum at all meetings. The Executive Committee shall keep minutes of its proceedings and shall report its actions to the next succeeding meeting of the Board of Directors.
 
Section 7. . The Board of Directors may from time to time create or eliminate one or more other committees, including but not limited to Audit, Compensation, Corporate Governance, and Asset Quality Review committees, and appoint members of the Board of Directors to serve on them. Each committee must have one or more members who serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors shall periodically approve a charter describing the duties of each committee. The provisions of the DGCL and these Bylaws that govern meetings, action without meetings, notice and waiver of notice, and quorum and voting requirements of the Board of Directors, shall apply to committees and their members as well. To the extent specified by the Board of Directors, each committee may exercise the authority of the Board of Directors, except as to the matters which the DGCL specifically excepts from the authority of such committees. Nothing contained in this Section shall preclude the
Other Committees
 
Board of Directors from establishing and appointing any committee, whether of directors or otherwise, not having or exercising the authority of the Board of Directors.
 
 
 
Section 1. . A regular meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held without other notice than this Bylaw provision immediately after, and at the same place as, the annual meeting of the Stockholders. In addition, the Board of Directors may provide, by resolution, the date, time and place for the holding of additional regular meetings.
Regular Meetings
 
Section 2. . Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at any date, time and place upon the call of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or of the Secretary acting under instructions from the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer or the President, or upon the call of any three directors. Special meetings may be held at any date, time and place and without special notice by unanimous consent of the directors.
Special Meetings
 
Section 3. . The person or persons calling a special meeting of the Board of Directors shall, at least two days before the meeting, give notice thereof by any usual means of communication. Such notice may be communicated, without limitation, in person; by telephone, facsimile, or other electronic transmission; or by mail or private carrier. Written notice of a directors meeting is effective at the earliest of the following:
Notice
 
 
 
 
 
Oral notice is effective when actually communicated to the director. Notice of an adjourned meeting of directors need not be given if the time and place are fixed at the meeting being adjourned. The notice of any meeting of directors need not describe the purpose of the meeting unless otherwise required by the DGCL.
 
Section 4. . A director may waive any notice required by the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws before or after the
Waiver of Notice
 
date and time stated in the notice. The waiver must be in writing, signed by the director entitled to the notice, and filed with the minutes or corporate records, except that, notwithstanding the foregoing requirement of written notice, a director's attendance at or participation in a meeting waives any required notice to the director of the meeting unless the director at the beginning of the meeting expressly objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
 
Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the directors or members of a committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation.
 
Section 5. . A majority of the number of directors in office immediately before the meeting begins, but in no case less than 1/3 of the total number of directors fixed by the Board of Directors, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board of Directors, but if less than such majority is present at a meeting, a majority of directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice.
Quorum
 
Section 6. . Except as otherwise provided in the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or herein, the act of the majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors.
Manner of Acting
 
Section 7. . The Chairman or the Chief Executive Officer shall preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors; provided, however, that in the absence or at the request of the Chairman of the Board, or if there shall not be a person holding such offices, the person selected to preside at a meeting of directors by a vote of a majority of the directors present shall preside at such meeting. The Secretary, or in the absence or at the request of the Secretary, any person designated by the person presiding at a meeting of the Board of Directors, shall act as secretary of such meeting.
Conduct of Meetings
 
Section 8. . Any action required or permitted to be taken at a Board of Directors meeting may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all members of the Board of Directors. The action must be evidenced by one or more consents in writing or by electronic transmission describing the action taken, which consent or consents shall be included in the minutes or filed with the corporate records.
Action Without a Meeting
 
Section 9. . Members of the Board of Directors or any committee designated by the Board of Directors may participate in a Board of Directors or committee meeting by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this subsection shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.

The title of any officer may include any additional designation descriptive of such officer's duties as the Board of Directors may prescribe.
Officers of the Corporation
 
Section 2. . The officers of the Corporation shall be elected by the Board of Directors or by a committee or an officer authorized by the Board of Directors or a committee to elect one or more officers; provided, however, that no officer may be authorized to elect the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or the President. Each officer shall hold office until his or her death, resignation, retirement, removal or disqualification or until such officer's successor is elected and qualified.
Appointment and Term
 
Section 3. . The compensation of all officers of the Corporation shall be fixed by or under the authority of the Board of Directors. No officer shall be prevented from receiving such salary by reason of the fact that such officer is also a director.
Compensation
 
Section 4. . An officer may resign at any time by communicating such officer's resignation to the Corporation. A resignation is effective when it is communicated unless it specifies in writing a later effective date. If a resignation is made effective at a later date and the Corporation accepts the future effective date, the Board of Directors may fill the pending vacancy before the effective date if the Board of Directors provides that the successor does not take office until the effective date. The Board of Directors, by the affirmative vote of a majority of its members, may remove the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or the President whenever in its judgment the best interest of the Corporation would be served thereby. In addition, the Board of Directors or a committee or an officer authorized by the Board of Directors or a committee may remove any other officer at any time with or without cause.
Resignation and Removal of Officers
 
Section 5. . The appointment of an officer does not itself create contract rights. An officer's removal does not itself affect the officer's contract rights, if any, with the Corporation, and an officer's resignation does not itself affect the Corporation's contract rights, if any, with the officer.
Contract Rights of Officers
 
Section 6. . The Board of Directors may elect a Chief Executive Officer.

Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, or employee of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, manager or employee of an Affiliate or of another corporation, association, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director,
Right to Indemnification
 
officer, manager, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, manager, or employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith if the indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner the indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Corporation or other entity covered by this Article VIII, and, with respect to any criminal action or preceding, had no reasonable cause to believe that indemnitee's conduct was unlawful. Such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 3 of this Article VIII with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. This Article shall supercede any conflicting provisions contained in the corporate governance documents of any Affiliate of the Corporation.
 
Section 2. . The right to indemnification conferred in this Article shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any proceeding for which such right to indemnification is applicable in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an "Undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section or otherwise.
Right to Advancement of Expenses
 
Section 3. . The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII, as limited by Section 7 hereof, shall be contract rights. If a claim under Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60 days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be 20 days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) in any suit by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an
Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit
 
Undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or independent legal counsel) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.
 
Section 4. . The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of Stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
Non-Exclusivity of Rights

Exhibit 10.1
 
Compensation of Nonemployee Directors
 
The form and amount of compensation paid to Bank of America's nonemployee directors is reviewed from time to time by the Compensation Committee of Bank of America's Board of Directors. On December 13, 2005, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, Bank of America's Board of Directors approved the following compensation package for nonemployee directors to take effect as of the Spring 2006 Annual Meeting of Stockholders:
 
 
Effective as of the Spring 2006 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, Bank of America will cease providing meeting fees to nonemployee directors. The annual restricted stock award will continue to be provided under the Bank of America Corporation Directors' Stock Plan and will continue to be subject to a one-year vesting requirement. Nonemployee directors will also continue to be eligible to defer their compensation under the Bank of America Corporation Director Deferral Plan.

Exhibit 10.2
 
 
 
The purpose of the Plan is to enable the Corporation to attract and retain persons of exceptional ability to serve as directors and to further align the interests of directors and stockholders in enhancing the value of the Common Stock. The Plan was originally established effective April 24, 1996 and approved by the Corporation's stockholders to provide for (i) the payment of shares of Common Stock to certain of the directors in connection with the partial termination of the NationsBank Corporation and Designated Subsidiaries Directors' Retirement Plan and (ii) the payment in Common Stock of a portion of the annual retainer fee payable to each Nonemployee Director. The Plan was amended and restated effective January 1, 2002 to add an annual stock option award feature. The Plan was further amended and restated December 10, 2002 to replace the annual award of stock options with an annual award of shares of Restricted Stock. This amendment and restatement of the Plan adopted at the December 13, 2005 meeting of the Board of Directors of the Corporation and effective as of the Spring 2006 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Corporation reflects certain changes to the compensation program for Nonemployee Directors. The Plan shall continue in effect unless and until terminated by the Board in accordance with Section 10 below.
 
 
For purposes of the Plan, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
 
"" means an amount, expressed in U.S. dollars, established by the Board from time to time for purposes of determining the number of shares of Restricted Stock awarded under the provisions of Section 5(a) below. The Board shall establish the Annual Award Amount based on its review of surveys regarding director compensation practices at peer companies, the written opinion of an outside advisor, and any other information it deems pertinent in establishing reasonable levels of compensation. Effective as of the Spring 2006 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Annual Award Amount shall be one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000).
Annual Award Amount
 
"" means the date of an annual stockholders meeting; , that with respect to an award of Restricted Stock made to a Nonemployee Director other than in connection with an annual stockholders meeting in accordance with Section 5(a) below, "Award Date" means the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date the Nonemployee Director commences services as a Nonemployee Director.

The Board shall be responsible for administering the Plan. The Board shall have all of the powers necessary to enable it to properly carry out its duties under the Plan. Not in limitation of the foregoing, the Board shall have the power to construe and interpret the Plan and to determine all questions that shall arise thereunder. The Board shall have such other and further specified duties, powers, authority and discretion as are elsewhere in the Plan either expressly or by necessary implication conferred upon it. The Board may appoint such agents as it may deem necessary for the effective performance of its duties, and may delegate to such agents such powers and duties as the Board may deem expedient or appropriate that are not inconsistent with the intent of the Plan. The decision of the Board upon all matters within its scope of authority shall be final and conclusive on all persons, except to the extent otherwise provided by law.
 
The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may delivered under the Plan shall equal 1,200,000 (after giving effect to the two-for-one stock split of the shares effective August 27, 2004). Such shares shall be subject to adjustment or substitution pursuant to Section 6 herein. If any shares of Restricted Stock awarded hereunder are canceled, lapse or forfeited in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 herein, then such shares shall again be available for delivery under the Plan. Shares delivered under the Plan may be original issue shares, treasury stock or shares purchased in the open market or otherwise, all as determined by the Chief Financial Officer of the Corporation (or the Chief Financial Officer's designee) from time to time.
 
 
(a) . Each Nonemployee Director who serves as a director of the Corporation at the close of each annual stockholders meeting of the Corporation shall be awarded a number of whole shares of Restricted Stock equal to the then applicable Annual Award Amount divided by the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the applicable Award Date. For a Nonemployee Director who first commences services as a Nonemployee Director other than at an annual stockholders meeting, such award shall be determined by multiplying the then applicable Annual Award Amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days from the date of commencement of services until the next annual stockholders meeting and the denominator of which is three hundred sixty-five (365), and the resulting amount shall be divided by the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the applicable Award Date.
Annual Restricted Stock Award
 
(b) . In no event shall the Corporation be obligated to issue fractional shares under this Section, but instead shall pay any such fractional share in cash based on the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the Award Date.
No Fractional Shares
 
(c) . Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5(c), shares of Restricted Stock shall not become vested until the first anniversary of the applicable Award Date (or, if earlier, the date of the next annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation) (the "Vesting Date"). If the Nonemployee Director ceases to serve as a Nonemployee Director before the Vesting Date due to the Nonemployee Director's death, or if there is a Change in Control prior to the Vesting Date, then the shares shall become fully vested as of the date of such death or Change in Control, as applicable. If the Nonemployee Director ceases to serve as a Nonemployee Director at any time for any reason other than death before the earlier of the Vesting Date or a Change in Control, then the shares shall become vested pro rata (based on the number of days between the Award Date, or in the case of a mid-year award made under Section 5(a) above the date of commencement of services, and the date of cessation of services divided by (x) 365 days for awards made at an annual stockholders meeting or (y) the number of days from the date of commencement of services until the next annual stockholders meeting for a mid-year award made under Section 5(a) above), and to the extent the shares are not thereby vested they shall be forfeited as of the date of such cessation of services. A Nonemployee Director may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any such shares of Restricted Stock until
Vesting
they become vested; however, the Nonemployee Director shall have the right to receive dividends with respect to the shares and to vote the shares prior to vesting. If a Nonemployee Director has elected to defer any shares of Restricted Stock pursuant to the Deferral Plan, (i) such shares shall not be issued under this Plan, (ii) the Nonemployee Director shall be credited with "Stock Units" (including for any fractional shares that would have otherwise been payable in cash under Section 5(b) above) to be paid in cash when and as provided for under the Deferral Plan and (iii) the vesting provisions of this Section 5(c) shall apply to any such shares that are deferred as Stock Units under the Deferral Plan.
 
 
In the event of any change in corporate capitalization, such as a stock split, or a corporate transaction, such as any merger, consolidation, separation, including a spin-off, or other distribution of stock or property of the Corporation, any reorganization (whether or not such reorganization comes within the definition of such term in Internal Revenue Code Section 368) or any partial or complete liquidation of the Corporation, such adjustment shall be made in the number and class of shares of Common Stock which may be delivered under the Plan, as may be determined to be appropriate and equitable by the Board, in its sole discretion, to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights.
 
 
The Corporation may impose such restrictions on the sale or other disposition of shares issued under this Plan as the Board deems necessary to comply with applicable securities laws. Certificates for shares issued under this Plan may bear such legends as the Corporation deems necessary to give notice of such restrictions.
 
 
No shares shall be issued under this Plan prior to compliance by the Corporation, to the satisfaction of its counsel, with any applicable laws. The Corporation shall not be obligated to (but may in its discretion) take any action under applicable federal or state securities laws (including registration or qualification of the Plan or the Common Stock) necessary for compliance therewith in order to permit the issuance of shares hereunder, except for actions (other than registration or qualification) that may be taken by the Corporation without unreasonable effort or expense and without the incurrence of any material exposure to liability.
 
 
The Board shall have the right and power at any time and from time to time to amend the Plan in whole or in part and at any time to terminate the Plan; , , that an amendment to the Plan may be conditioned on the approval of the stockholders of the Corporation if and to the extent the Board determines that stockholder approval is necessary or appropriate. No termination, amendment, or modification of the Plan shall adversely affect in any material way any Restricted Stock award previously granted under the Plan, without the written consent of the affected Nonemployee Director.
provided
however
 
Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the amendment and restatement of the Plan as set forth herein shall not affect any awards of Restricted Stock or stock options made under the Plan as in effect prior to the effective date of this document, which such awards shall instead be governed by the terms and provisions of the Plan as in effect at the time such awards were made.
 
 
The Plan shall be construed, administered, regulated and governed in all respects under and by the laws of the United States to the extent applicable, and to the extent such laws are not applicable, by the laws of the state of Delaware. The Plan shall be binding on the Corporation and any successor in interest of the Corporation.
