CHARLOTTE  Bank of America Corporation today reported that 2005 net income rose 19 percent to $16.89 billion from $14.14 billion a year earlier. Per-share earnings (diluted) increased 12 percent to $4.15 from $3.69. Return on average common equity for the year was 17.03 percent.
 
Excluding merger and restructuring charges of $412 million pre-tax, equal to 6 cents per share, the company earned $4.21 per share in 2005. Before merger and restructuring charges of $618 million pre-tax, or 11 cents per share, 2004 earnings were $3.80 per share.
 
For 2005, revenue grew 16 percent while noninterest expense increased 6 percent, producing positive operating leverage of 10 percentage points. Revenue growth was driven by a 28 percent increase in noninterest income, including equity investment gains, higher card income, and trading account profits.
 
For the fourth quarter of 2005, net income was $3.77 billion, or $.93 per share (diluted), compared to $3.85 billion, or $.94 per share a year earlier.
 
Excluding merger and restructuring charges of $59 million pre-tax, equal to 1 cent per share, the company earned $.94 per share in the latest quarter. Before merger and restructuring charges of $272 million pre-tax, or 4 cents per share, fourth quarter 2004 earnings were $.98 per share.
 
The decline in fourth quarter results was driven by increased provision expense and lower trading results. Total revenue grew 3 percent from the prior year, driven by higher card income, mortgage banking income and equity investment gains while noninterest expense decreased slightly.
 
Note: Under purchase accounting rules, results reported for the full year of 2004 do not include the impact of FleetBoston Financial Corporation for the first quarter of 2004. Fleet was acquired on April 1, 2004.

"With double-digit year-over-year growth in net income, earnings per share and revenue, 2005 was another successful year for Bank of America. However, we were impacted, like others, by several items in the fourth quarter." said Kenneth D. Lewis, chairman and chief executive officer. "The impact of the change in bankruptcy laws and changes in our practices for overdraft charge-offs and over limit credit card fees reduced pre-tax results by about $320 million. In addition, we had a weak trading quarter that was well under our performance in recent quarters. The bankruptcy issue will not recur and should actually benefit us going forward as we expect a reduced level of bankruptcy filings under the new law. We fully expect trading to do better in the coming quarters. Apart from those issues, our businesses had a very good year and a solid fourth quarter, which sets a good foundation for 2006."

Fourth Quarter Financial Summary
 
Revenue
 
Revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis grew 3 percent to $14.37 billion from $13.92 billion in the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was $8.1 billion, compared to $7.95 billion the previous year. The increase was driven by the impact of consumer and middle market business loan growth and higher levels of domestic deposits. The impact of these increases was offset by the effects of a flattening yield curve and a lower trading-related contribution. The net interest yield decreased 36 basis points to 2.82 percent.
 
Noninterest income increased 5 percent to $6.26 billion from $5.97 billion. These results were driven by increases in card income, mortgage banking income and equity investment gains.
 
Gains on the sale of debt securities were $71 million in the quarter compared to $101 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.

Efficiency
 
The efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter of 2005 was 50.95 percent (50.54 percent excluding merger and restructuring charges). Noninterest expense was relatively unchanged at $7.32 billion compared to $7.33 billion a year ago. This quarter's expenses included reductions in marketing expense and an increase in incentive compensation. Also included in fourth quarter expenses were $59 million in pre-tax merger and restructuring charges related to the Fleet merger.
 
Credit Quality
 
Credit quality was generally stable. As anticipated, both charge-offs and provision expense rose in the fourth quarter from both the third quarter of 2005 and the fourth quarter of 2004 as bankruptcy filings reached record levels in anticipation of legislative changes effective in October. The fourth quarter results included an estimated $524 million in incremental charge-offs and $143 million in provision expense attributable to bankruptcy reform. In addition to this, credit costs rose from a year ago due to a slower rate of improvement in commercial credit quality and increased balances and seasoning of the card portfolio.
 
 
 
 
 
Capital Management
 
Total shareholders' equity was $101.22 billion at December 31, 2005. Period-end assets grew to $1.29 trillion. The Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 8.21 percent, unchanged from September 30, 2005 and up from 8.10 percent a year earlier.
 
During the quarter, Bank of America paid a cash dividend of $0.50 per share. The company also issued 18.9 million common shares, primarily related to employee stock options and ownership plans, and repurchased 32.3 million common shares. Period-ending common shares issued and outstanding were 4.00 billion in the fourth quarter, compared to 4.01 billion in the third quarter of 2005 and 4.05 billion in the fourth quarter of 2004.

2005 Full Year Financial Summary
 
Revenue
 
Revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis grew 16 percent to $57.60 billion from $49.60 billion in 2004.
 
Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis increased 8 percent to $31.99 billion from $29.51 billion the previous year. The increase was driven by the addition of Fleet, consumer and middle market business loan growth, higher domestic deposit levels and a larger securities portfolio. The impact of these increases was partially offset by the effects of a flattening yield curve and a lower trading-related contribution. The net interest yield decreased 38 basis points to 2.88 percent.
 
Noninterest income increased 28 percent to $25.61 billion from $20.08 billion. These results were driven by the addition of Fleet, increases in equity investment gains, card income, and trading account profits.
 
Gains on the sale of debt securities were $1.08 billion in 2005, down significantly from $2.12 billion in 2004.
 
Efficiency
 
The efficiency ratio for 2005 was 49.79 percent (49.08 percent excluding merger and restructuring charges). Noninterest expense increased 6 percent to $28.68 billion from $27.01 billion a year ago primarily due to the addition of Fleet and the build-out of the capital markets platform. Included in 2005's expenses were $412 million in pre-tax merger and restructuring charges related to the Fleet merger. Full year 2005 cost savings from the merger with Fleet were $1.85 billion.
 
Credit Quality
 
Provision expense was $4.01 billion in 2005, a 45 percent increase from 2004. Net charge-offs totaled $4.56 billion, or 0.85 percent of loans and leases, compared to $3.11 billion, or 0.66 percent of loans and leases in 2004. The increase in provision expense and net charge-offs was driven by growth and seasoning of the credit card portfolio, new advances on accounts previously securitized and the impact of increased bankruptcy filings. Commercial credit quality remained strong. However, a slower rate of improvement in commercial credit quality compared to 2004 contributed to a reduced benefit from provision.
 
Capital Management
 
For 2005, Bank of America paid more than $7.68 billion in cash dividends to common shareholders. The company also issued 79.6 million common shares, primarily related to employee stock options and ownership plans, and repurchased 126.4 million common shares for $5.76 billion, resulting in a net decrease of 46.9 million common shares.

2005 Full Year Business Segment Results
 
Global Consumer and Small Business Banking
 
 
 
 
For 2005, revenue grew 15 percent and net income increased 20 percent. This was due to continued strong growth in the card business, on-going deposit account growth, balance growth and increased activity, which generated increased service charge income. Also contributing were significantly higher corporate mortgage banking income, primarily due to a writedown of mortgage servicing rights in 2004, and the addition of Fleet.
 
Card income rose more than 25 percent to $5.48 billion as a result of increased customer activity, growth in managed outstandings and the impact of the National Processing, Inc. acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2004. The bank's consumer real estate unit delivered stronger performance for the year, including 42 percent growth in average home equity loans to $63.9 billion in outstandings.
 
Provision expense increased primarily due to growth and seasoning of the credit card portfolio, new advances on accounts previously securitized and the impact of incremental bankruptcy reform charge-offs.
 
For the fourth quarter, net income rose 9 percent to $1.76 billion from $1.61 billion a year ago. Revenue increased 4 percent to $7.43 billion from $7.12 billion. Card income increased 8 percent and service charge income increased 6 percent. Provision expense increased primarily due to higher card charge-offs resulting from bankruptcy reform and growth and seasoning of the portfolio.

Global Business and Financial Services
 
 
 
 
For 2005, Global Business and Financial Services benefited from strong loan growth across all business lines, which included the purchase of loans from General Motors Acceptance Corporation as well as the addition of Fleet. Loan growth was especially robust in the Northeast during the year. Net income grew 19 percent as strong revenue combined with improved operating leverage overcame the reduced benefits from provision. Revenue grew 21 percent.
 
Average loans and leases in Global Business and Financial Services grew by $29 billion, or 19 percent, as commercial activity continued to increase, countering the effects of continued spread compression. Strong deposit growth was fueled by increases in Commercial Real Estate and Business Banking.
 
The $393 million reduction in provision benefit during 2005 was driven by a slower rate of improvement in commercial credit quality.
 
For the fourth quarter of 2005, net income was $1.13 billion, down from $1.21 billion a year ago. Revenue increased 7 percent to $2.90 billion from $2.72 billion a year ago. Strong loan and deposit growth was tempered by an increase of $391 million in provision compared to the same quarter last year.

Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking
 
 
 
 
For 2005, revenue decreased slightly to $9.01 billion from $9.05 billion. Net interest income was lower by 19 percent due to lower trading related margin driven by a flat yield curve and reduced spread and fee income on the loan portfolio. Noninterest income increased 14 percent led by trading profits and equity commissions which more than offset the decline in trading-related margin. Investment banking revenue was down slightly as were service charges.
 
Net income declined 10 percent to $1.74 billion primarily due a decline in the provision benefit as a result of slowing improvement in credit quality. This was partially offset by gains on the sales of securities. Lower legal and settlement charges from 2004 were offset by the investment in the capital markets platform.
 
During 2005, Banc of America Securities achieved several gains in market share as tabulated by Thomson Financial. These included increased market share in underwriting high-yield debt to 12.0 percent from 10.7 percent; underwriting investment grade debt to 7.4 percent from 5.2 percent and public finance to 4.9 percent from 4.0 percent. Banc of America Securities maintained its top five rankings in syndicated loans, leveraged loans, high yield and investment grade underwriting.
 
For the fourth quarter, net income decreased to $123 million from $589 million a year ago. Revenue was $1.95 billion compared to $2.19 billion a year ago. Reduced benefit from provision of $191 million was due primarily to a slower rate of improvement in commercial credit quality. Slightly improved investment banking results and trading-related revenue from interest rate products was tempered by reduced trading related revenue caused by decreased market activity in fixed income and foreign exchange products.

Global Wealth and Investment Management
 
 
 
For 2005, Global Wealth and Investment Management increased net income by 49 percent driven by the benefit of Fleet, higher asset management fees, higher loan volume and higher deposit revenue due in part to the migration of Premier Banking relationships from Global Consumer and Small Business Banking.
 
Asset management fees increased 21 percent from 2004 due to the addition of Fleet and the strong growth in assets under management from December 31, 2004 of more than $30 billion, or 7 percent. Growth in assets under management was due to more than $24 billion in net inflows as well as increased market values.
 
Sales of brokerage services to Premier clients, the mass affluent sector, continued to grow. About 28 percent of Premier customers used these investment services at year-end, up from 25 percent at the end of 2004.
 
For the fourth quarter of 2005, net income rose 32 percent to $636 million from the previous year. Revenue increased 15 percent to $1.93 billion.
 
All Other
 
For 2005, All Other reflected $1.0 billion of net income, compared to net income of $799 million for 2004. Equity Investment gains were $1.6 billion in 2005 compared to $750 million in 2004. For the fourth quarter of 2005, All Other reflected $112 million of net income, compared to a net loss of $47 million for the same period last year. Equity Investment gains were $403 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to $402 million in the same period last year.

Reconciliation to GAAP financial measures
 
Supplemental financial data presented on an operating basis is a basis of presentation not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) that excludes merger and restructuring charges. We believe that the exclusion of merger and restructuring charges, which represent events outside our normal operations, provides a meaningful period-to-period comparison and is more reflective of normalized operations.
 
Shareholder value added (SVA) is a key measure of performance not defined by GAAP that is used in managing our growth strategy orientation and strengthening our focus on generating long-term growth and shareholder value. SVA is used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity (i.e. capital) at the individual unit level and is an integral component in the analytics for resource allocation. Using SVA as a performance measure places specific focus on whether incremental investments generate returns in excess of the costs of capital associated with those investments. Each business segment has a goal for growth in SVA reflecting the individual segment's business and customer strategy.
 
Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. See the Tables below for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the quarters ended December 31, 2005, September 30, 2005, June 30, 2005, March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, and the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.
