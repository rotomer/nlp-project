The maximum aggregate principal amount authorized to be outstanding at any time under the Program is U.S. $20 billion (or the equivalent in other currencies). Under the Program, the Registrant may issue unsecured medium-term notes with such terms, including currency, rate and maturity, as are agreed between the Registrant and the purchasers of the notes at the time of sale. These notes are issued pursuant to the terms of an Amended and Restated Agency Agreement dated as of August 4, 2005, between the Registrant and JPMorgan Chase Bank, London Branch, as issuing and principal paying agent.         
Notes are issued under the Program pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"); are not registered under the Act; and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to a U.S. person absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Act.
            On March 23, 2006, the Registrant announced that it had agreed to sell  1,750,000,000 of its 4% Fixed/Floating Rate Callable Subordinated Notes, due March 2018.  A form of news release containing information about those notes is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.  The notes were issued on March 28, 2006.  After issuing those notes, there is approximately U.S. $15.6 billion (or its equivalent in other currencies) in principal amount of notes outstanding under the Program, leaving approximately U.S. $4.4 billion (or its equivalent in other currencies) available for issuance under the Program as of that date.
