Exhibit 99.1
 
The FleetBoston Financial Corporation ("FleetBoston") Merger agreement (the "FleetBoston Merger") was announced on October 27, 2003 and was effective April 1, 2004. Accordingly, the financial results of FleetBoston are included in the historical financial statements for Bank of America Corporation (the "Corporation") beginning on April 1, 2004.
The MBNA Corporation ("MBNA") Merger agreement (the "MBNA Merger") was announced on June 30, 2005 and provided for each outstanding share of MBNA common stock to be converted into the right to receive 0.5009 shares of the Corporation's common stock plus a cash component of $4.125 per share. The financial results of MBNA will be included in the financial statements for the Corporation beginning January 1, 2006.
The following Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not indicate the financial results of the combined companies had the companies actually been combined at the beginning of the periods presented and had the impact of possible revenue enhancements, expense efficiencies, asset dispositions and share repurchases, among other factors, been considered. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). However, as a result of the Mergers, we believe that the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information will provide a more useful year-to-year comparison in future periods versus comparing to the Corporation's historical financial information.
For 2004, the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information and explanatory notes present how the merger of the Corporation, FleetBoston, and MBNA, herein referred to collectively as "the Mergers," may have appeared had the businesses actually been combined at the beginning of 2004 under the purchase method of accounting with the Corporation treated as the acquirer. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2004 was prepared assuming the Mergers were completed on January 1, 2004.
For 2005, the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information and explanatory notes present how the merger of the Corporation and MBNA may have appeared had the businesses actually been combined at the beginning of 2005 under the purchase method of accounting with the Corporation treated as the acquirer. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005 includes the assets and liabilities of MBNA at their estimated fair values. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2005 gives effect to the MBNA Merger as if the MBNA Merger had been completed on January 1, 2005.
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes of the Corporation, FleetBoston and MBNA.
 
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet combines the historical balance sheets of Bank of America and MBNA assuming the companies had been combined on December 31, 2005, on a purchase accounting basis.

Note 1- Basis of Pro Forma Presentation
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information related to the Mergers is included as of December 31, 2005 and for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005. The Mergers were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the Corporation's cost to acquire FleetBoston and MBNA was allocated to the assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities (including executory contracts and other commitments) of FleetBoston and MBNA at their respective fair values on the dates the Mergers were completed.
Certain amounts in the historical consolidated financial statements of FleetBoston and MBNA have been reclassified to conform to the Corporation's financial information presentation. In addition, certain historical Bank of America prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information presented in this document does not necessarily indicate the results of operations or the combined financial position that would have resulted had the Mergers been completed at the beginning of the applicable period presented, nor is it indicative of the results of operations in future periods or the future financial position of the combined company.
The MBNA Merger agreement is effective January 1, 2006 and is being accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" (SFAS 141). The financial results of MBNA will be included in the Corporation's financial statements beginning January 1, 2006. See Note 2 for the preliminary allocation of the purchase price.
The FleetBoston Merger agreement was effective April 1, 2004 and was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS 141. Accordingly, the financial results of FleetBoston are included in the historical financial statements for Bank of America beginning on April 1, 2004.
On October 14, 2004, the Corporation acquired all outstanding shares of National Processing, Inc. ("NPC") for $1.4 billion in cash. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Income for 2004 do not include pro forma adjustments for the acquisition of NPC. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, total revenues generated from the NPC business acquired were approximately $395 million and $76 million and total expenses incurred from the NPC business acquired were approximately $308 million and $52 million.
Note 2- Pro Forma Adjustments
The Corporation provided Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information relating to the FleetBoston Merger in its current report on Form 8-K filed on January 23, 2006, which should be read in conjunction with the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information presented herein. There have been no changes to the pro forma adjustments indicated in that Form 8-K.
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information for the Mergers includes the Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005 assuming the MBNA Merger was completed on December 31, 2005. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2004 was prepared assuming the Mergers were completed on January 1, 2004. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2005 was prepared assuming the MBNA Merger was completed on January 1, 2005.
The MBNA purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the MBNA Merger date. This allocation is based on management's current estimation and could change as the fair value calculations are finalized and more information becomes available.
 
For comparative and illustrative purposes only, the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005 assume that the MBNA purchase accounting adjustments remain the same for each year presented. The MBNA pro forma adjustments included in the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information are as follows:

Effective January 1, 2006, the Corporation classifies the impact of these credit derivatives that economically hedge the portfolio in Other Income. Prior to January 1, 2006, the impact was classified in Trading Account Profits. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Income reflect this reclassification.

The management accounting reporting process derives segment and sub-segment results by utilizing allocation methodologies for revenue, expense, and capital. The net income derived for sub-segments (i.e., Deposits, Mortgage, Card Services, etc) are dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an activity based costing model, other methodologies, and assumptions management believes that are appropriate to reflect the results of the business. An example, specifically with regard to cost allocation, is where banking center costs are not only allocated to various consumer products (i.e., deposits, mortgage, card, etc) that utilize the banking center, but also are allocated to other sub-segments such as Treasury Services within . A discussion of the Corporation's allocation methodologies is presented as part of on pages 26 and 27 of the Corporation's 2005 Form 10-K filed on March 16, 2006.

Business Segment Operations
The Corporation migrates qualifying affluent customers, deposits and net interest income related to those customers from to Premier Banking and Investments. To provide a view of organic growth in Premier Banking and Investments, the Corporation allocates the original migrated deposit balances as well as corresponding net interest income at original spreads from Premier Banking and Investments to Other sub-segment. The Corporation believes that the resulting Premier Banking and Investments sub-segment approximates an organic, incremental view of the business.
