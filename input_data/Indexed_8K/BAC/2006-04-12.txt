ITEM 4.01. CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT.
On November 23, 2005, the MBNA Corporation 401(k) Plus Savings Plan (the "Plan") dismissed Ernst & Young LLP ("E&Y") as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Plan.  On December 5, 2005, the Plan engaged Morris, Davis & Chan LLP ("MDC") as its independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005. 
            
The decision to change the independent registered public accounting firm for the Plan has not been approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Bank of America Corporation (the "Audit Committee").  However, the Audit Committee is expected to consider the ratification of such actions at its next regularly scheduled meeting.
The reports of E&Y on the Plan's financial statements for the past two fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle.
In connection with the audits of the Plan's financial statements for each of the two fiscal years ended December 31, 2004, and through November 23, 2005, there were (1) no disagreements with E&Y on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of E&Y, would have caused E&Y to make reference thereto in their reports on the financial statements for such years, and (2) no reportable events (as defined in Regulation SK Item 304(a)(1)(v)). The Plan has requested that E&Y furnish it with a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether or not E&Y agrees with the above statements. A copy of such letter dated April 12, 2006 from E&Y is being filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Current Report on Form 8K.
During the two fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and through December 5, 2005, the Plan did not consult with MDC regarding either: (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Plan's financial statements, and neither a written report was provided to the Plan or oral advice was provided that MDC concluded was an important factor considered by the Plan in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement, as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation SK and the related instructions to Item 304 of Regulation SK, or a reportable event, as that term is described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation SK.
