CHARLOTTE  Bank of America Corporation today reported that net income in the first quarter of 2006 rose 14 percent to $4.99 billion from $4.39 billion a year earlier. Per-share earnings (diluted) were unchanged from a year earlier at $1.07. Return on average common equity for the first quarter was 15.44 percent. Under purchase accounting rules, results for the first quarter of 2005 do not include MBNA, which was acquired on January 1, 2006.
Excluding merger and restructuring charges of $98 million pre-tax, equal to 1 cent per share, the company earned $5.05 billion, or $1.08 per share, in the first quarter of 2006. A year earlier merger and restructuring charges of $112 million reduced per-share earnings by 2 cents.
Revenue grew 31 percent while noninterest expense was up 26 percent. However, on a pro forma basis (including MBNA's first quarter of 2005 results), revenue increased almost 10 percent while noninterest expense was up only 5 percent. Information regarding pro forma results was included in the Form 8-K filed on April 10, 2006.
This significant operating leverage was driven by continued strong performance in the consumer businesses as well as improvements in trading account profits, equity investment gains and investment banking income.
The current quarter's results included $320 million, or 5 cents per share, in expense from the impact of SFAS 123R, which accelerates the recognition of certain equity-based compensation expenses for retirement-eligible associates. In addition, as previously announced, the company terminated certain derivatives used as hedges in asset liability management that did not qualify for SFAS 133 hedge accounting at a cost of $175 million, or 2 cents per share.

"We are off to a great start in 2006," said Kenneth D. Lewis, chairman and chief executive officer. "We have strong momentum in all our businesses as the benefits from continued execution in our consumer businesses were accompanied this quarter by a rebound in trading and good performance in investment banking and wealth management."

First Quarter 2006 Financial Summary
Revenue
Revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis grew 31 percent to $17.94 billion from $13.74 billion in the first quarter of 2005. Last year's results did not include MBNA.
Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was $9.04 billion, compared to $7.71 billion the previous year. In addition to MBNA, the increase was driven by the impact of consumer, middle market, commercial and large corporate loan growth and increases in asset liability management activity primarily due to changes in interest rates. The impact of these increases was partially offset by a lower trading-related contribution. The net interest yield increased two basis points to 2.98 percent.
Noninterest income was $8.90 billion compared to $6.03 billion. In addition to MBNA, these results were driven by continued strength in service fee income, increases in trading account profits, equity investment gains, investment banking income and card income.
Gains on sales of debt securities were $14 million in the quarter compared to $659 million in the first quarter of 2005.

Efficiency
The efficiency ratio for the first quarter of 2006 was 49.74 percent. Noninterest expense increased to $8.92 billion compared to $7.06 billion a year ago. In addition to MBNA and the increase in personnel costs due to changes in equity-based compensation accounting, expenses were higher due to increased marketing spending related to consumer banking initiatives. Also included in first quarter 2006 expenses were $98 million in pre-tax merger and restructuring charges related to the MBNA acquisition.
Credit Quality
Credit quality was stable. As anticipated, net charge-offs decreased substantially from the fourth quarter of 2005 due to the impact of bankruptcy reform. Net charge-offs were down compared to the first quarter of 2005 due to lower bankruptcies, partially offset by growth and seasoning of the card portfolio and new advances on accounts previously securitized. Provision expense rose compared to the first quarter of 2005 due to the addition of MBNA, a slower rate of improvement in commercial credit quality, and an increase in reserves to cover the anticipated return to a more normal level of bankruptcy-related charge-offs.
 
 
 
 
Capital Management
Total shareholders' equity was $129.43 billion at March 31, 2006. Period-end assets grew to $1.38 trillion. The Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 8.45 percent, up from 8.25 percent on December 31, 2005 and 8.26 percent a year earlier.
During the quarter, Bank of America paid a cash dividend of $0.50 per share. In conjunction with the MBNA acquisition, the company issued 631 million common shares. The company also issued 38.9 million shares primarily related to employee stock options and ownership plans, and repurchased 88.5 million common shares. Period-ending common shares issued and outstanding were 4.58 billion for the first quarter of 2006, compared to 4.00 billion for the fourth quarter of 2005 and 4.04 billion for the first quarter of 2005.

First Quarter 2006 Business Segment Results
Global Consumer and Small Business Banking
 
 
 
Revenue grew 49 percent and net income increased 42 percent from a year ago. Last year's first quarter did not include MBNA results. On a pro forma basis (including MBNA's first quarter of 2005 results), revenue increased 8 percent while net income increased 11 percent.
Results were driven by increased service charges due to new account growth, higher debit card income due to increased usage and higher credit card income as Bank of America's combination with MBNA showed early positive results. These increases were dampened by lower results in consumer real estate, which was affected by margin compression due in part to higher interest rates as compared to the first quarter of 2005.
Provision expense increased primarily due to the addition of MBNA and the increase in reserves to cover the anticipated return to a more normal level of bankruptcy-related charge-offs.

Global Corporate and Investment Banking
 
 
 
During 2005 Bank of America announced the combination of Global Business and Financial Services and Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking into a new segment called Global Corporate and Investment Banking. This combination was effective January 1, 2006.
Revenue increased 2 percent to $5.56 billion from $5.45 billion. Net income was lower by 14 percent due to higher provision expense and compensation costs. The impact of a flattening yield curve and a reduction in the market value of the bank's credit default swap book also lowered results.
The revenue increase was driven by 19 percent growth in Capital Markets and Advisory Services, as investments in personnel and trading infrastructure helped produce record trading and investment banking results. Investment banking revenue grew 40 percent from the first quarter of 2005, as increased market activity and deal flow produced strong results in advisory fees, debt underwriting and equity underwriting.
Provision expense rose $190 million, primarily due to a provision benefit in the first quarter of 2005 resulting from actions to reduce certain Latin American portfolio exposures as well as a slower rate of improvement in commercial credit quality.

Global Wealth and Investment Management
 
 
 
Revenue increased 8.5 percent and net income 5 percent from a year ago. Results were driven by higher asset management fees, higher loan volume and higher deposit revenue due in part to the continued migration of certain banking relationships from Global Consumer and Small Business Banking.
Asset management fees increased 10 percent from the first quarter of 2005 due to higher assets under management balances driven by net asset inflows of $33 billion in both short-term and long-term assets in addition to increased market values of $28 billion.
 
 
 
All Other
For the first quarter of 2006, All Other reflected $111 million of net income, compared to net income of $80 million for the first quarter of 2005. Equity Investment gains were $513 million in the first quarter of 2006 compared to $264 million in the first quarter of 2005. Included in All Other was the $175 million, or 2 cents per share, loss on derivatives used as economic hedges.
Note: Al de Molina, chief financial officer, will discuss first quarter 2006 results in a conference call at 9:30 a.m. (Eastern Time) today. The call can be accessed via a webcast available on the Bank of America Web site at http://investor.bankofamerica.com.

Fully taxable-equivalent basis data
 
Reconciliation to GAAP financial measures
Supplemental financial data presented on an operating basis is a basis of presentation not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) that excludes merger and restructuring charges. We believe that the exclusion of merger and restructuring charges, which represent events outside our normal operations, provides a meaningful period-to-period comparison and is more reflective of normalized operations.
Shareholder value added (SVA) is a key measure of performance not defined by GAAP that is used in managing our growth strategy orientation and strengthening our focus on generating long-term growth and shareholder value. SVA is used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity (i.e. capital) at the individual unit level and is an integral component in the analytics for resource allocation. Using SVA as a performance measure places specific focus on whether incremental investments generate returns in excess of the costs of capital associated with those investments. Each business segment has a goal for growth in SVA reflecting the individual segment's business and customer strategy.
Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. See the tables below for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the quarters ended March 31, 2006, December 31, 2005, September 30, 2005, June 30, 2005 and March 31, 2005.
