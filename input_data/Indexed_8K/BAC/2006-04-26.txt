CHARLOTTE - The Bank of America Corporation board of directors today approved the repurchase of up to 200 million additional shares of common stock, authorizing management to spend up to $12 billion within 18 months.
"Over the last five years, our strong earnings growth has enabled Bank of America to return $46 billion in capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and net share repurchases," said Kenneth D. Lewis, Bank of America chairman and chief executive officer.  "We expect to continue generating strong returns and will aggressively continue to return excess capital to our shareholders."
The new program is intended to be implemented through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private transactions.  On March 31, 2006, Bank of America had 4.6 billion common shares outstanding. The Board of Directors last approved an authorization of 200 million shares in March 2005.
