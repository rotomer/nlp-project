(c)                The Offerors will deliver to the Representative as many signed copies of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein) as the Representative  may reasonably request and will also deliver to the Representative a conformed copy of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto (without exhibits) for each of the Underwriters.
(d)               The Offerors will furnish to each Underwriter, from time to time during the period when the Final Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act, such number of copies of the Final Prospectus (as amended or supplemented) as such Underwriter may reasonably request for the purposes contemplated by the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations.

(f)                 The Offerors will endeavor, in cooperation with the Underwriters, to qualify the Capital Securities (and the Capital Securities Guarantee) and the Junior Subordinated Notes for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and the other jurisdictions of the United States as the Underwriters may designate; provided, however, that none of the Offerors shall be obligated to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified.
(g)                The Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Underwriters as soon as practicable, but not later than 90 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement (which need not be audited) of the Company and its subsidiaries, covering an applicable period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the "Effective Date" (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the 1933 Act) of the Registration Statement, which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the 1933 Act.

                                                                                     12
 
(j)                 The Offerors will prepare a final term sheet containing only a description of the Capital Securities, in a form approved by the Representative and contained in Schedule D of this Agreement, and will file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the 1933 Act as promptly as possible, but in any case not later than the time required by such rule (such term sheet, the "Final Term Sheet").  Any such Final Term Sheet is an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus for purposes of this Agreement.
(k)               The Offerors represent that each has not made, and agree that, unless they obtain the prior written consent of the Representative, they will not make, any offer relating to the Capital Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405 of the 1933 Act) required to be filed by an Offeror with the Commission or retained by an Offeror under Rule 433 of the 1933 Act; provided that the prior written consent of the Representative shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule C hereto.  Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representative is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus."  The Offerors agree that (i) they have treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and (ii) they have complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 of the 1933 Act applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.  The Offerors consent to the use by any Underwriter of a free writing prospectus that (a) is not an "issuer free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 433, and (b) contains only (i) information describing the preliminary terms of the Capital Securities or their offering, (ii) information that describes the final terms of the Capital Securities or their offering and that is included in the Final Term Sheet of the Offerors contemplated in paragraph (j) above or (iii) information permitted by Rule 134 of the 1933 Act.
(l)                  The Offerors will apply the net proceeds from the sale of the Capital Securities sold by them in the manner described under the caption "Use of Proceeds" in each of the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus.

(3)               On the basis of procedures (but not an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) consisting of:
(i)                  Reading the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, the board of directors, executive committee and audit committee of the Company and the board of directors of the Principal Subsidiary Bank as set forth in the minute books through a specified date not more than five business days prior to the date of delivery of such letter;

(iii)               Making inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters regarding the specific items for which representations are requested below;
nothing has come to their attention as a result of the foregoing procedures that caused them to believe that:
(a)                the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations thereunder;
(b)               any material modifications should be made to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles;
(c)                (i)  at the date of the latest available interim financial data and at the specified date not more than five business days prior to the date of the delivery of such letter, there was any change in the common stock or the consolidated long-term debt (other than scheduled repayments of such debt) of the Company and the subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as compared with the amounts shown in the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus or (ii) for the period from the date of the latest available financial data to a specified date not more than five business days prior to the delivery of such letter, there was any change in the common stock or the consolidated long-term debt (other than scheduled repayments of such debt) of the Company and the subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, except in all instances for changes or decreases which the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur, or PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall state any specific changes or decreases.
The letter shall also state that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has carried out certain other specified procedures, not constituting an audit, with respect to certain amounts, percentages and financial information which are included or incorporated by reference in the Registration                                                                                          22
Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and which are specified by the Representative and agreed to by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, and has found such amounts, percentages and financial information to be in agreement with the relevant accounting, financial and other records of the Company and its subsidiaries identified in such letter.
In addition, at the Closing Time, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representative a letter or letters, dated the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representative, to the effect set forth in this subsection (e).
(f)                 Subsequent to the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in the immediate prior sub-section or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or other), earnings, business or properties of the Trust or the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as one enterprise, the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the judgment of the Representative, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Capital Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus.
(g)                At the Closing Time, counsel for the Underwriters shall have been furnished with such documents and opinions as they may require for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon the issuance and sale of the Capital Securities as herein contemplated and related proceedings, or in order to evidence the accuracy of any of the representations or warranties, or the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained; and all proceedings taken by the Offerors, in connection with the issuance and sale of the Capital Securities as herein contemplated shall be satisfactory in form and substance to the Representative and Morrison & Foerster LLP, counsel for the Underwriters. 
(h)                At the Closing Time, at least one "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the 1933 Act), has rated the Capital Securities in one of its four highest rating categories and (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any such nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities.
(i)                  There shall not have come to the Representative's attention any facts that would cause the Representative to believe that the Disclosure Package, as of the Initial Sale Time, or the Final Prospectus, at the time it was required to be delivered to a purchaser of the Securities, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances existing at the time of such delivery, not misleading.
(j)                 In connection with the sale and purchase of the Capital Securities, if any condition specified in this Section with respect thereto shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as required to be fulfilled, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representative by
                                                                                      23
 notice to the Offerors, in writing or by telephone or telegraph confirmed in writing, at any time at or prior to the Closing Time and such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and except that Sections 1, 6, and 7 shall survive any such termination and will remain in full force and effect.
SECTION 6.       INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION
(a)                The Offerors jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or arise out of or are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Offerors will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with the Underwriter Information or arises out of or is based upon statements in or omissions from that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification of the Trustee (Form T-1) under the 1939 Act of any Trustee.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Offerors may otherwise have.
(b)               Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Trust, the Trustees, each of the Company's directors, each of the Company's officers who signs the Registration Statement and each of the Trustees who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company or the Trust within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Offerors to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Offerors by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereof.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have.  The Offerors acknowledge that (i) the names of the Underwriters and the statements required by Item 508 of Regulation S-K set forth in the language on the cover page or under the heading "Underwriting", (ii) the sentences relating to concessions and reallowances, and (iii) the paragraph related to stabilization and syndicate covering transactions in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, constitute the only information furnished in writing by or
                                                                                           24
on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, and the Representative confirms that such statements are correct.
(c)                Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection.  In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties.  Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 6 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to local counsel), approved by the Representative in the case of subparagraph (a), representing the indemnified parties under subparagraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii).
(d)               To provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) of this Section 6 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Offerors on the grounds of policy or otherwise, the Offerors and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Offerors and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion so that the Underwriters are responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the underwriting discount bears to the sum of such discount and the purchase price of the Securities specified in Schedule B hereto and the Offerors are responsible for the balance; provided, however, that (y) in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the
                                                                                     25
Capital Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount applicable to the Capital Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and (z) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 6, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls either of the Offerors within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, each officer or trustee of the Offerors who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director or trustee of the Offerors shall have the same rights to contribution as the Offerors, subject in each case to clause (y) of this paragraph (d).  Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d).
(e)                The Company agrees to indemnify the Trust against all losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred by the Trust under Section 6(a) hereof.
SECTION 7.       TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT.  This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representative, by notice given to the Offerors prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, or (ii) a banking moratorium or a material disruption in the commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities, or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or material escalation of hostilities or other calamity or crisis (in the United States or elsewhere) the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representative, impracticable to market the Securities.
SECTION 8.       DEFAULT BY ONE OR MORE OF THE UNDERWRITERS.  If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Time to purchase all or part of the Capital Securities that it or they are obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), the Representative shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representative shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24hour period, then:
(a)                if the number of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the Capital Securities, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated to purchase the full amount thereof, or 
(b)               if the number of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the Capital Securities, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any nondefaulting Underwriter.

Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if the Capital Securities are no longer in book-entry only form, the relevant record dates shall be the close of business on May 1 and November 1 prior to the regular Interest Payment Date.                                                                                           8
 
(b)        The amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360day year of twelve 30-day months.  Except as provided in the following sentence, the amount of interest payable for any period shorter than a full semi-annual period for which interest is computed will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in such period. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date.
(c)        If, at any time while the Property Trustee is the Holder of any Notes, the Trust or the Property Trustee is required to pay any taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature (other than withholding taxes) imposed by the United States, or any other domestic taxing authority, then, in any case, the Company will pay as additional interest ("Additional Interest") on the Notes held by the Property Trustee, such additional amounts as shall be required so that the net amounts received and retained by the Trust and the Property Trustee after paying such taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges will be equal to the amounts the Trust and the Property Trustee would have received had no such taxes, duties, assessments or other government charges been imposed.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, interest, the payment of which has been deferred because of the extension of the interest payment period pursuant to this Section 4.1, will bear interest thereon at the Coupon Rate compounded semi-annually for each semi-annual period of the Extended Interest Payment Period ("Compounded Interest").  At the end of the Extended Interest Payment Period, the Company shall pay all interest accrued and unpaid on the Notes, including any Additional Interest and Compounded Interest (together, "Deferred Interest") that shall be payable to the Holders of the Notes in whose names the Notes are registered in the Security Register on the first record date after the end of the Extended Interest Payment Period.  Before the termination of any Extended Interest Payment Period, the Company may further extend such period; such period together with all such previous and further extensions thereof shall not exceed 10 consecutive semi-annual periods or extend beyond the Maturity Date of the Notes.  Upon the termination of any Extended Interest Payment Period and upon the payment of all Deferred Interest then due, the Company may commence a new Extended Interest Payment Period, subject to the foregoing requirements.  No interest shall be due and payable during an Extended Interest Payment Period, except at the end thereof, but the Company may prepay at any time all or any portion of the interest accrued during an Extended Interest Payment Period.

By the terms of the Indenture, the Notes are issuable in series that may vary as to amount, date of maturity, rate of interest and in other respects as provided in the Indenture.  This series of Notes is limited in aggregate principal amount as specified in the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture.
Because of the occurrence and continuation of a Special Event, as defined in the Indenture, in certain circumstances, this Note may become due and payable at a prepayment price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being prepaid or (b) as determined by the Quotation Agent (as defined in the Indenture), the present value of scheduled payments of principal and interest from the prepayment date to May 23, 2036, on the Notes being prepaid, discounted to the prepayment date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate (as defined in the Indenture) plus a spread of 0.50% and, in the case of (a) or (b), any accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to but excluding the date of such prepayment (the "Special Event Prepayment Price"). The Special Event Prepayment Price shall be paid prior to 12:00 noon, New York time, on the date of such prepayment or at such earlier time as the Company determines.

Any prepayment pursuant to this paragraph will be made upon not less than 30 days' nor more than 60 days' notice at the Optional Prepayment Price or the Special Event Prepayment Price, as applicable.  If the Notes are only partially prepaid by the Company pursuant to an Optional Prepayment, the Notes will be prepaid or by lot or by any other method utilized by the Trustee; if, at the time of prepayment, the Notes are registered as a Global Note, the Depositary shall determine the principal amount of such Notes held by each Note holder to be prepaid in accordance with its procedures.

The Definitive Capital Security Certificates shall be typed, printed, lithographed or engraved or may be produced in any other manner as is reasonably acceptable to the Regular Trustees, as evidenced by their execution thereof, and may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification or designation and such legends or endorsements as the Regular Trustees may deem appropriate, or as may be required to comply with any law or with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or with any rule or regulation of any stock exchange on which Capital Securities may be listed, or to conform to usage.

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Company Indemnified Person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
nolo contendere
(ii)           The Note Issuer shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any Company Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Trust to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a Company Indemnified Person against expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust and except that no such indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such Company Indemnified Person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Trust unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.                                                                               38
 
(iii)          To the extent that a Company Indemnified Person shall be successful on the merits or otherwise (including dismissal of an action without prejudice or the settlement of an action without admission of liability) in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified, to the full extent permitted by law, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.
(iv)          Any indemnification under paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a) (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Note Issuer only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the Company Indemnified Person is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in paragraphs (i) and (ii).  Such determination shall be made (1) by the Regular Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of such Regular Trustees who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the Holders of the Common Securities.
(v)           Expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by a Company Indemnified Person in defending a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a) shall be paid by the Note Issuer in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Company Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Note Issuer as authorized in this Section 10.4(a).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance shall be made by the Note Issuer if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Regular Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees, (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iii) the Common Security Holder of the Trust, that, based upon the facts known to the Regular Trustees, counsel or the Common Security Holder at the time such determination is made, such Company Indemnified Person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such Company Indemnified Person believed or had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.  In no event shall any advance be made in instances where the Regular Trustees, independent legal counsel or Common Security Holder reasonably determine that such person deliberately breached his duty to the Trust or to the Holders of the Common or Capital Securities.
(vi)          The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other paragraphs of this Section 10.4(a) shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification and advancement of expenses may be entitled under any agreement, vote of                                                                                39

Any repeal or modification of this Section 10.4(a) shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing.
(vii)         The Note Issuer or the Trust may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Company Indemnified Person against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Note Issuer would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Section 10.4(a).
(viii)         For purposes of this Section 10.4(a), references to "the Trust" shall include, in addition to the resulting or surviving entity, any constituent entity (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger, so that any person who is or was a director, trustee, officer or employee of such constituent entity, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent entity as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of another entity, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Section 10.4(a) with respect to the resulting or surviving entity as he would have with respect to such constituent entity if its separate existence had continued.
(ix)          The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Section 10.4(a) shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Company Indemnified Person and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
(b)           The Note Issuer agrees to indemnify the (i) Property Trustee, (ii) the Delaware Trustee, (iii) any Affiliate of the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, and (iv) any officers, directors, shareholders, members, partners, employees, representatives, custodians, nominees or agents of the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee (each of the Persons in (i) through (iv) being referred to as a "Fiduciary Indemnified Person") for, and to hold each Fiduciary Indemnified Person harmless against, any and all loss, liability, damage, claim or expense including taxes (other than taxes based on the income of such Fiduciary Indemnified Person) incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the trust or trusts hereunder, including the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) of defending itself against or investigating any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder.  The obligation to indemnify as set forth in this Section 10.4(b) shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Declaration.                                                                                      40

Meetings of the Holders of Securities; Action by Written Consent
(a)           Meetings of the Holders of any class of Securities may be called at any time by the Regular Trustees (or as provided in the terms of the Securities) to consider and act on any matter on which Holders of such class of Securities are entitled to act under the terms of this Declaration, the terms of the Securities or the rules of any stock exchange on which the Capital Securities are listed or admitted for trading.  The Regular Trustees shall call a meeting of the Holders of such class if directed to do so by the Holders of at least 10% in liquidation amount of such class of Securities.  Such direction shall be given by delivering to the Regular Trustees one or more calls in a writing stating that the signing Holders of Securities wish to call a meeting and indicating the general or specific purpose for which the meeting is to be called.  Any Holders of Securities calling a meeting shall specify in writing the Security Certificates held by the Holders of Securities exercising the right to call a meeting and only those Securities specified shall be counted for purposes of determining whether the required percentage set forth in the second sentence of this paragraph has been met.
(b)           Except to the extent otherwise provided in the terms of the Securities, the following provisions shall apply to meetings of Holders of Securities:
(i)            notice of any such meeting shall be given to all the Holders of Securities having a right to vote thereat at least seven days and not more than 60 days before the date of such meeting.  Whenever a vote, consent or approval of the Holders of Securities is permitted or required under this Declaration or the rules of any stock exchange on which the Capital Securities are listed or admitted for trading, such vote, consent or approval may be given at a meeting of the Holders of Securities.  Any action that may be taken at a meeting of the Holders of Securities may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing setting forth the action so taken is signed by the Holders of Securities owning not less than the minimum amount of Securities in liquidation amount that would be necessary to                                                                          44
 authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all Holders of Securities having a right to vote thereon were present and voting.  Prompt notice of the taking of action without a meeting shall be given to the Holders of Securities entitled to vote who have not consented in writing.  The Regular Trustees may specify that any written ballot submitted to the Security Holder for the purpose of taking any action without a meeting shall be returned to the Trust within the time specified by the Regular Trustees;
(ii)           each Holder of a Security may authorize any Person to act for it by proxy on all matters in which a Holder of Securities is entitled to participate, including waiving notice of any meeting, or voting or participating at a meeting.  No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of 11 months from the date thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy.  Every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the Holder of Securities executing it.  Except as otherwise provided herein, all matters relating to the giving, voting or validity of proxies shall be governed by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware relating to proxies, and judicial interpretations thereunder, as if the Trust were a Delaware corporation and the Holders of the Securities were stockholders of a Delaware corporation;
(iii)          each meeting of the Holders of the Securities shall be conducted by the Regular Trustees or by such other Person that the Regular Trustees may designate; and
(iv)          unless the Statutory Trust Act, this Declaration, the terms of the Securities, the Trust Indenture Act or the listing rules of any stock exchange on which the Capital Securities are then listed or trading otherwise provide, the Regular Trustees, in their sole discretion, shall establish all other provisions relating to meetings of Holders of Securities, including notice of the time, place or purpose of any meeting at which any matter is to be voted on by any Holders of Securities, waiver of any such notice, action by consent without a meeting, the establishment of a record date, quorum requirements, voting in person or by proxy or any other matter with respect to the exercise of any such right to vote.

Pursuant to Section 7.1 of the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, dated as of May 15, 2006 (as amended from time to time, the "Declaration"), the designation, rights, privileges, restrictions, preferences and other terms and provisions of the Capital Securities and the Common Securities are set out below (each capitalized term used but not defined herein has the meaning set forth in the Declaration);
1.         .
Designation and Number
(a)        . The Capital Securities of the Trust (liquidation amount $1,000 per Capital Security) are hereby designated for purposes of identification only as "BAC Capital Trust XI 6 5/8% Capital Securities" (the "Capital Securities").  The Trust shall issue 1,000,000 Capital Securities with an aggregate liquidation amount of $1,000,000,000.  The Capital Security Certificates evidencing the Capital Securities shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 to the Declaration, with such changes and additions thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary usage, custom or practice or to conform to the rules of any stock exchange on which the Capital Securities are listed.
Capital Securities
(b)        . The Common Securities of the Trust (liquidation amount $1,000 per Security) are hereby designated for purposes of identification only as "BAC Capital Trust XI 6 5/8% Common Securities" (the "Common Securities").  The Trust shall issue 31,000 Common Securities with an aggregate liquidation amount of $31,000,000.  The Common Security Certificates evidencing the Common Securities shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2 to the Declaration, with such changes and additions thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary usage, custom or practice.
Common Securities
            2.         .
Distributions
(a)        Distributions payable on each Security will be fixed at a rate per annum of 6 5/8% (the "Coupon Rate") of the stated liquidation amount of $1,000 per Security, such rate being the interest rate payable on the Notes to be held by the Property Trustee.  Distributions in arrears for more than one semi-annual period will bear interest thereon compounded semi-annually at the Coupon Rate (to the extent permitted by applicable law).  A Distribution is payable only to the extent that payments are made in respect of the Notes held by the Property Trustee and to the extent the Property Trustee has funds available therefor.  The amount of Distributions payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30day months.  The amount of Distributions payable for any period shorter than a full distribution period will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a 360-day year of twelve 30-day                                                                                                 I-1
 months.  The amount of interest payable for any full interest period will be computed by dividing the annual rate by two.
(b)        Distributions on the Securities will be cumulative, will accrue from May 23, 2006 and will be payable semi-annually in arrears, on May 23 and November 23 of each year, beginning on November 23, 2006, except as otherwise described below.  The Note Issuer has the right under the Indenture to defer payments of interest on the Notes by extending the interest payment period from time to time on the Notes for a period not exceeding 10 consecutive semi-annual periods (each an "Extension Period"), during which Extension Period no interest shall be due and payable on the Notes, no Extension Period may extend beyond the Stated Maturity.  As a consequence of such deferral, Distributions also will be deferred on the Capital Securities for the same period.  Despite such deferral, semi-annual Distributions will continue to accrue with interest thereon (to the extent permitted by applicable law) at the Coupon Rate compounded semi-annually during any such Extension Period.  Prior to the termination of any such Extension Period, the Note Issuer may extend further such Extension Period; such Extension Period together with all such previous and further extensions thereof may not exceed 10 consecutive semi-annual or extend beyond the Stated Maturity.  Payments of accrued Distributions will be payable to Holders as they appear on the books and records of the Trust or the Clearing Agency, as the case may be, on the first record date after the end of the Extension Period.  Upon the termination of any Extension Period and the payment of all amounts then due, the Note Issuer may commence a new Extension Period, subject to the above requirements.  No interest shall be due and payable during an Extension Period, except at the end thereof, but the Note Issuer may repay at any time all or any portion of the interest accrued during an Extension Period.
provided

provided
that
(c)        Distributions on the Securities will be payable to the Holders thereof as they appear on the books and records of the Trust on the relevant record dates.  While the Capital Securities remain in BookEntry only form, the relevant record dates shall be one Business Day prior to the relevant payment dates, which payment dates correspond to the interest payment dates on the Notes.  Payment of Distributions on the Securities held in Book-Entry only form will be made to the Depositary in immediately available funds.  The Depositary's practice is to credit Clearing Agency Participants' accounts on the relevant payment date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on the Depositary's records unless the Depositary has reason to believe that it will not receive payments on such payment date.  Payments by (i) Clearing Agency Participants and (ii) securities brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies and other entities that clear transactions through or maintain a direct or indirect custodial relationship with a Clearing Agency Participant (an "Indirect Participant") to Capital Security Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of such Clearing Agency Participants and Indirect Participants and not of the Depositary, the Trust or the Corporation, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.  Payment of distributions to the Depositary is the responsibility of the Trust, disbursement of such payments to Clearing Agency Participants is the responsibility of the Depositary, and disbursement of such payments to the Capital Security Beneficial Owners is the responsibility of the Clearing Agency Participants and Indirect Participants.  The relevant record dates for the Common Securities shall be the same record date as for the Capital Securities.  If the Capital Securities shall no longer remain in BookEntry only form, the regular record dates for the Capital Securities shall be the close of business on the May 1 and November 1 prior to the                                                                                                 I-2
 relevant payment dates, which payment dates correspond to the interest payment dates on the Notes.  Distributions payable on any Securities that are not punctually paid on any Distribution payment date, as a result of the Note Issuer having failed to make a payment under the Notes, will cease to be payable to the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the relevant record date, and such defaulted Distribution will instead be payable to the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the special record date or other specified date determined in accordance with the Indenture.  If any date on which Distributions are payable on the Securities is not a Business Day, then payment of the Distribution payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date.
(d)        In the event that there is any money or other property held by or for the Trust that is not accounted for hereunder, such property shall be distributed Pro Rata (as defined herein) among the Holders of the Securities.
            3.         .
Liquidation Distribution Upon Dissolution
In the event of any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, winding-up or termination of the Trust, the Holders on the date of the dissolution, winding-up or termination, as the case may be, will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Trust available for distribution to Holders after satisfaction of liabilities of creditors an amount equal to the aggregate of the stated liquidation amount of $1,000 per Security plus accrued and unpaid Distributions thereon to the date of payment (such amount being the "Liquidation Distribution"), unless, in connection with such dissolution, windingup or termination, Notes in an aggregate stated principal amount equal to the aggregate stated liquidation amount of such Securities, with an interest rate equal to the Coupon Rate of, and bearing accrued and unpaid interest in an amount equal to the accrued and unpaid Distributions on, such Securities, shall be distributed on a Pro Rata basis to the Holders of the Securities in exchange for such Securities.
If, upon any such dissolution, the Liquidation Distribution can be paid only in part because the Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then the amounts payable directly by the Trust on the Securities shall be paid on a Pro Rata basis.  Holders of the Common Securities will be entitled to receive distributions upon any such dissolution Pro Rata with Holders of the Capital Securities, except that if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Capital Securities shall have a preference over the Common Securities with respect to such distributions.
            4.         .
Redemption and Distribution
(a)        The Securities are subject to redemption at the Stated Maturity, prior to the Stated Maturity, in whole or in part, on one or more occasions, at any time at the election of the Sponsor, or in whole, but not in part, in certain circumstances, following the occurrence of a Special Event as follows:                                                                                                 I-3
 
(i)         Upon payment of the Notes at a payment price equal to the principal amount of the Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon at the Stated Maturity, the proceeds from such payment shall be applied simultaneously to redeem the Securities at the Maturity Redemption Price.
(ii)        In the event of a Special Event Prepayment, the proceeds from such Special Event Prepayment shall be applied simultaneously to redeem the Capital Securities at the Special Event Redemption Price.
(iii)       The Securities also may be redeemed, in whole or in part, contemporaneously with an optional prepayment of the Notes at the Optional Prepayment Price.  If fewer than all the outstanding Securities are to be so redeemed, the Common Securities and the Capital Securities will be redeemed Pro Rata, and the Capital Securities to be redeemed will be as described in Section 4(d)(ii) below.
(b)        If the Sponsor has given a notice of its election to terminate the Trust, the Regular Trustees shall dissolve the Trust and, after satisfaction of creditors, cause Notes held by the Property Trustee, having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate stated liquidation amount of the Securities, with an interest rate equal to the Coupon Rate of, and bearing accrued and unpaid interest in an amount equal to the accrued and unpaid Distributions on, and having the same record date for payment as, the Securities, to be distributed to the Holders of the Securities in liquidation of such Holders' interests in the Securities within 90 days following receipt of the Sponsor's notice of election.
(c)        On and from the date fixed by the Regular Trustees for any distribution of Notes and dissolution of the Trust:  (i) the Securities will no longer be deemed to be outstanding, (ii) the Depositary or its nominee as the record Holder of the Capital Securities, will receive a registered Global Security or Securities representing the Notes to be delivered upon such distribution and any certificates representing Securities, except for certificates representing Capital Securities held by the Depositary or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee), will be deemed to represent beneficial interests in the Notes having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate stated liquidation amount of, with an identical interest rate, and accrued and unpaid interest equal to accrued and unpaid Distributions on such Securities until such certificates are presented to the Note Issuer or its agent for transfer or reissue.  The Trust may not redeem fewer than all the outstanding Securities unless all accrued and unpaid Distributions have been paid on all Securities for all semi-annual Distribution periods terminating on or before the date of redemption.  If the Notes are distributed to holders of the Securities, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Note Issuer will use its best efforts to have the Notes listed on the securities exchange, if any, on which the Capital Securities were listed immediately prior to the distribution of the Notes.
(d)        Redemption or Distribution Procedures shall be as follows:
(i)         A Redemption/Distribution Notice for the Securities to be redeemed or exchanged will be given by the Trust by mail to each Holder not fewer than 15 nor more than 60 days before the redemption date or exchange date which, in the case of a redemption, will be the date fixed for redemption of the Notes.  For purposes of the                                                                                 I-4
calculation of the redemption date or exchange date and the dates on which notices are given pursuant to this Section 4(d)(i), a Redemption/ Distribution Notice shall be deemed to be given on the day such notice is first mailed by firstclass mail, postage prepaid, to Holders of Securities.  Each Redemption/Distribution Notice shall be addressed to the Holders of Securities at the address of each such Holder appearing in the books and records of the Trust.  No defect in the Redemption/Distribution Notice or in the mailing of either with respect to any Holder shall affect the validity of the redemption or exchange proceedings with respect to any other Holder.

(iii)       If Securities are to be redeemed and the Trust gives a Redemption/Distribution Notice, which notice may only be issued if the Notes are repaid as set out in this Section 4 (which notice will be irrevocable), then (A) while the Capital Securities are in Book-Entry only form, with respect to the Capital Securities, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the redemption date, provided that the Note Issuer has paid the Property Trustee a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the related prepayment or maturity of the Notes, the Property Trustee will deposit irrevocably with the Depositary or its nominee (or successor Clearing Agency or its nominee) funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price with respect to the Capital Securities and will give the Depositary irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of the Capital Securities, and (B) with respect to Capital Securities issued in definitive form and Common Securities, the Note Issuer has paid the Property Trustee a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the related prepayment or maturity of the Notes, the Property Trustee will pay the relevant Redemption Price to the Holders of such Securities by check mailed to the address of the relevant Holder appearing on the books and records of the Trust on the redemption date.

(iv)       Redemption/Distribution Notices shall be sent by the Regular Trustees on behalf of the Trust to (A) in respect of the Capital Securities,the Depositary or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee) if the Global Securities have been issued or, if Definitive Capital Security Certificates have been issued, to the Holder thereof, and (B) in respect of the Common Securities to the Holder thereof.

Distributions payable on each Capital Security will be fixed at a rate per annum of 6 5/8% (the "Coupon Rate") of the stated liquidation amount of $1,000 per Capital Security, such rate being the rate of interest payable on the Notes to be held by the Property Trustee on behalf of the Trust.  Distributions in arrears for more than one semi-annual period will bear interest thereon (to the extent permitted by applicable law) at the Coupon Rate, compounded semi-annually.  A Distribution is payable only to the extent that payments are made in respect of the Notes held by the Property Trustee and to the extent the Property Trustee has funds available therefor.  The amount of Distributions payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30day months.
Except as otherwise described below, Distributions on the Capital Securities will be cumulative, will accrue from the date of original issuance and will be payable semi-annually in arrears on May 23 and November 23 of each year, beginning on November 23, 2006, to the person in whose name the Capital Security is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such installment, which shall be the close of business on the Business Day next preceding such payment date - [IF PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE DECLARATION, THE SECURITIES ARE NO LONGER REPRESENTED BY A GLOBAL SECURITY - which shall be the close of business on May 1 and November 1 prior to the relevant payment date.]  The Note Issuer has the right under the Indenture to defer payments of interest by extending the interest payment period from time to time on the Notes for a period not exceeding 10 consecutive semi-annual periods (each an "Extension Period"), no Extension Period shall last beyond the date of the maturity of the Notes.  As a consequence of such deferral, Distributions will also be deferred hereunder for the same period.  Despite such deferral, semi-annual Distributions will continue to accrue with interest thereon (to the extent permitted by applicable law) at the Coupon Rate compounded semi-annually during any such Extension Period. Prior to the termination of any such Extension Period, the Note Issuer may further extend such Extension Period; such Extension Period together with all such previous and further extensions thereof may not exceed 10 consecutive semi-annual periods or extend beyond the maturity date of the Notes.  Payments of accrued Distributions will be payable to Holders as they appear on the books and records of the Trust on the first record date after the end of the Extension Period.  Upon the termination of any Extension Period and the payment of all amounts then due, the Note Issuer may commence a new Extension Period, subject to the above requirements.

Distributions payable on each Common Security will be fixed at a rate per annum of 6 5/8% (the "Coupon Rate") of the stated liquidation amount of $1,000 per Common Security, such rate being the rate of interest payable on the Notes to be held by the Property Trustee.  Distributions in arrears will continue to accumulate at the same rate compounded semi-annually.  A Distribution is payable only to the extent that payments are made in respect of the Notes held by the Property Trustee and to the extent the Property Trustee has funds available therefor.  The amount of Distributions payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30day months.
Except as otherwise described below, Distributions on the Common Securities will be cumulative, will accrue from the date of original issuance and will be payable semi-annually in arrears on May 23 and November 23 of each year, beginning on November 23, 2006, to Holders of record 15 days prior to such payment dates, which payment dates shall correspond to the interest payment dates on the Notes.  The Note Issuer has the right under the Indenture to defer payments of interest by extending the interest payment period from time to time on the Notes for a period not exceeding 10 consecutive semi-annual periods (each an "Extension Period"), no Extension Period shall last beyond the date of the maturity of the Notes.  As a consequence of such deferral, Distributions will also be deferred hereunder for the same period.  Despite such deferral, semi-annual Distributions will continue to accrue with interest thereon (to the extent permitted by applicable law) at the Coupon Rate compounded semi-annually during any such Extension Period. Prior to the termination of any such Extension Period, the Note Issuer may further extend such Extension Period; such Extension Period together with all such previous and further extensions thereof may not exceed 10 consecutive semi-annual periods or extend beyond the maturity date of the Notes.  Payments of accrued Distributions will be payable to Holders as they appear on the books and records of the Trust on the first record date after the end of the Extension Period.  Upon the termination of any Extension Period and the payment of all amounts then due, the Note Issuer may commence a new Extension Period, subject to the above requirements.
