Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On June 28, 2006, the board of directors (the "Board") of Bank of America Corporation (the "Corporation"), upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee of the Board, approved an annual retainer of $30,000 for the Board's lead director, in addition to any other compensation for Board and committee service. Also on June 28, 2006, the Board determined that an annual retainer would no longer be provided to the chair of the Executive Committee of the Board in view of the Board's expectation that such committee will meet less frequently than in the past.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Dated: June 28, 2006
