CHARLOTTE  Bank of America Corporation today reported that net income in the second quarter of 2006 rose 18 percent to $5.48 billion from $4.66 billion a year earlier. Per-share earnings (diluted) were $1.19, up 4 percent from $1.14 a year earlier, the previous record quarter on a split-adjusted basis. Return on average common shareholders' equity for the second quarter was 17.26 percent. Under purchase accounting rules, results for the second quarter of 2005 do not include MBNA, which was acquired on January 1, 2006.
Excluding merger and restructuring charges of $194 million pre-tax, equal to 3 cents per share, the company earned $5.60 billion, or $1.22 per share (diluted), in the second quarter of 2006. A year earlier merger and restructuring charges of $121 million related to the acquisition of FleetBoston Financial reduced per-share earnings by 2 cents.
"Our performance this quarter demonstrates the power of our unmatched franchise and diverse revenue sources, as well as the skill and hard work of our associates," said Kenneth D. Lewis, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our ongoing advances in operational excellence led to our best efficiency ratio ever, while our investments in innovation and service across the bank produced gains in the consumer, capital markets and wealth management businesses. We offset the difficult interest rate environment with great execution in every line of business, leading to a significant increase in fee income and continued momentum in the growth of shareholder value."
Revenue grew 25 percent from a year earlier while noninterest expense was up 24 percent. On a pro forma basis (including MBNA's second quarter of 2005 results), revenue increased 6 percent while noninterest expense was up 2 percent. Historical information regarding pro forma results was included in the Form 8-K filed on April 10, 2006.
The year-over-year improvement was driven by strong performance across the consumer businesses, continued growth in trading account profits, investment banking income and equity investment gains, as well as improvements in asset management categories.
For the first six months of 2006, Bank of America earned $10.46 billion, or $2.25 per share (diluted), compared to $9.05 billion, or $2.21 per share on a split-adjusted basis, a year earlier.

Second Quarter 2006 MBNA Transition Highlights
 
 
 
 
Second Quarter 2006 Financial Summary
Revenue
Revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis grew 25 percent to $18.52 billion from $14.78 billion in the second quarter of 2005. Last year's results did not include MBNA.
Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was $8.93 billion, compared to $7.83 billion the previous year. Besides the addition of MBNA, the increase was driven by loan growth and increases in asset-liability management (ALM) activity, partially offset by lower core deposit levels and spread compression. The net interest yield increased 5 basis points to 2.85 percent.
Noninterest income was up 38 percent to $9.60 billion from $6.96 billion. Besides the addition of MBNA, which helped boost card income, these results were driven by continued strength in service fee income and increases in trading account profits, investment banking income and equity investment gains. Other income declined significantly. A year ago this component benefited from the results of the ALM process, including the change in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges that did not qualify for SFAS 133 and the sale of whole loans.
Sales of debt securities resulted in a $9 million net loss in the second quarter of 2006 compared to a $325 million net gain in the second quarter of 2005.
Efficiency
The efficiency ratio for the second quarter of 2006 was 47.06 percent (46.01 percent before merger and restructuring charges) driven by continued positive operating leverage. Noninterest expense increased to $8.72 billion from $7.02 billion a year ago. Besides the addition of MBNA, expenses increased due to marketing spending related to consumer banking initiatives and revenue-related incentive compensation. Also included in second quarter 2006 expenses were $194 million in pre-tax merger and restructuring charges related to the MBNA acquisition.
The effective tax rate increased to 35.56 percent in the second quarter from 33.69 percent in the second quarter of 2005 primarily as a result of a $175 million cumulative charge reflecting recently passed tax legislation related to foreign sales corporation provisions.
Credit Quality
Credit quality remained stable. Net charge-offs increased from the second quarter of 2005 due to the addition of MBNA and new advances on accounts previously securitized, partially offset by lower credit card bankruptcy charge-offs. Provision expense rose compared to the second quarter of 2005 due to the addition of MBNA and 2005 commercial credit reserve releases. These increases were partially offset by decreased credit card costs.
 
 
Total managed net losses were $1.81 billion, or 0.98 percent of managed loans and leases. This compared to $1.48 billion, or 0.84 percent, on March 31, 2006 and $1.01 billion, or 0.77 percent on June 30, 2005.
 
 
Capital Management
Total shareholders' equity was $127.84 billion at June 30, 2006. Period-end assets grew to $1.45 trillion. The Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 8.33 percent, compared to 8.45 percent on March 31, 2006 and 8.16 percent a year earlier.
During the quarter, Bank of America paid a cash dividend of $0.50 per share. The company issued approximately 30 million common shares primarily related to employee stock options and ownership plans, and repurchased slightly more than 83 million common shares in the second quarter of 2006. Period-ending common shares issued and outstanding were 4.53 billion for the second quarter of 2006, compared to 4.58 billion for the first quarter of 2006 and 4.02 billion for the second quarter of 2005.
Second Quarter 2006 Business Segment Results
Global Consumer and Small Business Banking
 
Revenue grew 52 percent to $10.48 billion and net income more than doubled to $3.11 billion. Last year's second quarter results did not include MBNA. On a pro forma basis (including MBNA's second quarter of 2005 results), revenue increased 10 percent while net income increased 42 percent.
Results were driven by increased service charges due to new account growth, higher debit card income due to increased usage and higher credit card income as Bank of America's combination with MBNA continued to exhibit positive results. Mortgage reported lower results primarily resulting from margin compression caused by higher interest rates as compared to the second quarter of 2005.
 
 
 
 
 
Global Corporate and Investment Banking
 
Revenue increased 16 percent to $5.72 billion from $4.91 billion. Net income was essentially flat at $1.72 billion. Loan growth helped mitigate the effects of a flattening yield curve.
The growth in revenue was fueled by increased capital markets activity. Capital Markets and Advisory Services benefited from positive sales and trading results in Liquid Products, Credit Products and Structured Products as previous investments in personnel and trading infrastructure came to fruition. Investment Banking benefited from increased market activity and continued leadership in leveraged debt underwriting. Treasury Services benefited from increased net interest income due to higher short-term interest rates.
Net income was impacted by increased provision expense primarily in Business Lending and increased performance-based compensation in Capital Markets and Advisory Services. Provision expense rose primarily due to the absence this quarter of benefits from the release of reserves in 2005 related to reduced uncertainties associated with the FleetBoston credit integration.
 
 
 
 
Global Wealth and Investment Management
 
Revenue increased 9 percent and net income rose 14 percent from a year ago. Results were driven by higher asset management fees, higher loan volume and higher deposit spreads, as well as continued migration of certain banking relationships from Global Consumer and Small Business Banking.
Asset management fees increased 11 percent from the second quarter of 2005 due to higher assets under management balances driven by total net asset inflows of $42 billion in addition to increased market values of $15 billion.
 
 
 
 
All Other
All Other reflected $20 million of net income for the quarter, compared to $862 million in the second quarter of 2005. In 2005 All Other benefited from the results of the ALM process, including the change in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges that did not qualify for SFAS 133 and the sale of whole loans. The second quarter of 2006 included losses on sales of debt securities of $6 million, compared to gains on sales of debt securities of $204 million in the second quarter of 2005. Equity investment gains in this segment were $524 million compared to $479 million in the second quarter of 2005.

Supplemental Financial Data

Fully taxable-equivalent basis data
 
Reconciliation to GAAP financial measures
Supplemental financial data presented on an operating basis is a basis of presentation not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) that excludes merger and restructuring charges. We believe that the exclusion of merger and restructuring charges, which represent events outside our normal operations, provides a meaningful period-to-period comparison and is more reflective of normalized operations.
Shareholder value added (SVA) is a key measure of performance not defined by GAAP that is used in managing our growth strategy orientation and strengthening our focus on generating long-term growth and shareholder value. SVA is used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity (i.e. capital) at the individual unit level and is an integral component in the analytics for resource allocation. Using SVA as a performance measure places specific focus on whether incremental investments generate returns in excess of the costs of capital associated with those investments. Each business segment has a goal for growth in SVA reflecting the individual segment's business and customer strategy.
Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. See the tables below for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the quarters ended June 30, 2006, March 31, 2006, December 31, 2005, September 30, 2005 and June 30, 2005, and the six months ended June 30, 2006 and 2005.
