CHARLOTTE  Bank of America Corporation today reported that net income in the third quarter of 2006 rose 41 percent to $5.42 billion from $3.84 billion a year earlier. Per-share earnings (diluted) were $1.18, up 24 percent from $0.95 a year earlier. Return on average common shareholders' equity for the third quarter was 16.64 percent. Under purchase accounting rules, results for the third quarter of 2005 do not include MBNA, which was acquired on January 1, 2006.
Excluding merger and restructuring charges of $269 million pre-tax, equal to 4 cents per share, the company earned $5.59 billion, or $1.22 per share (diluted), in the third quarter of 2006. A year earlier merger and restructuring charges of $120 million related to the acquisition of FleetBoston Financial reduced per-share earnings by 2 cents.
"Bank of America turned in another solid performance this quarter, highlighted by strong sales, good expense control and excellent execution across the company," said Kenneth D. Lewis, chairman and chief executive officer. "While margins continue to be under pressure due to the continuing flat yield curve and intense competition, we are benefiting from our ability to provide unmatched convenience and innovative financial solutions to our customers and clients. Our scale and scope is enabling us to make substantial investments across our company to drive growth while continuing to produce the financial results our shareholders expect."

Revenue grew 32 percent from a year earlier while noninterest expense was up 22 percent. On a pro forma basis (including MBNA's third quarter of 2005 results), revenue increased 10 percent while noninterest expense was up 2 percent, resulting in positive operating leverage. Historical information regarding pro forma results was included in the Form 8-K filed on April 10, 2006.
For the first nine months of 2006, Bank of America earned $15.88 billion, or $3.44 per share (diluted), compared to $12.89 billion, or $3.16 per share a year ago.

Third Quarter 2006 Financial Summary
Revenue
Revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis grew 32 percent to $18.96 billion from $14.35 billion in the third quarter of 2005. Last year's results did not include MBNA.
Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was $8.89 billion, compared to $7.93 billion the previous year. Besides the addition of MBNA, the increase was driven by loan growth and increases in asset-liability management activity, partially offset by higher cost of funding due to lower deposit levels. The net interest yield decreased 5 basis points to 2.73 percent.
Noninterest income was up 57 percent to $10.01 billion from $6.42 billion. Besides the addition of MBNA, which helped boost card income, these results were impacted by continued strength in service fee income and increases in trading account profits. Other income increased significantly due to a $720 million pre-tax gain on the sale of the bank's Brazilian operations. In 2005 this component was affected negatively by approximately $400 million due to the results of the ALM process, including the change in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges that did not qualify for SFAS 133.
Sales of debt securities resulted in a $469 million net loss in the third quarter of 2006 as the company repositioned its balance sheet compared to a $29 million net gain in the third quarter of 2005.
Efficiency
The efficiency ratio for the third quarter of 2006 was 46.75 percent (45.33 percent before merger and restructuring charges) driven by continued positive operating leverage. The sale of the Brazilian operations benefited the efficiency ratio by approximately 200 basis points. Noninterest expense increased to $8.86 billion from $7.29 billion a year ago. Expenses increased primarily due to MBNA, including $269 million in pre-tax merger and restructuring charges.
Cost savings for the merger in the third quarter were $357 million pre-tax, due primarily to personnel reductions, technology savings and marketing synergies. The transition has exceeded projected savings targets for 2006.

Credit Quality
Consumer credit quality remained stable and commercial credit quality continued to be good. Net charge-offs increased from the third quarter of 2005 due to the addition of MBNA and previously reserved for charge-offs associated with credit card minimum payment requirements. This was partially offset by lower commercial net charge-offs, as 2005 included charge-offs related to the domestic airline industry, and lower 2006 credit card bankruptcy related charge-offs. Provision expense was essentially flat compared to the third quarter of 2005 as increases from the addition of MBNA were partially offset by reduced credit-related costs on the domestic credit card portfolio.
 
 
Total managed net losses were $2.20 billion, or 1.11 percent of total average managed loans and leases. This compared to $1.81 billion, or 0.98 percent in the second quarter of 2006 and $1.24 billion, or 0.90 percent in the third quarter of 2005.
 
 
Capital Management
Total shareholders' equity was $133.60 billion at September 30, 2006. Period-end assets were $1.45 trillion. The Tier 1 Capital Ratio increased to 8.48 percent from 8.33 percent on June 30, 2006 and 8.27 percent a year earlier.
During the quarter, Bank of America paid a cash dividend of $0.56 per share. Additionally, the company issued approximately 30 million common shares primarily related to employee stock options and ownership plans, and repurchased nearly 60 million common shares. Period-ending common shares issued and outstanding were 4.50 billion for the third quarter of 2006, compared to 4.53 billion for the second quarter of 2006 and 4.01 billion for the third quarter of 2005.

Third Quarter 2006 Business Segment Results
Global Consumer and Small Business Banking
 
Revenue grew 44 percent to $10.44 billion and net income increased 57 percent to $2.89 billion. Last year's third quarter results did not include MBNA. Results were driven by higher card income due to the MBNA acquisition and higher net interest margin. On a pro forma basis (including MBNA's third quarter of 2005 results), revenue increased 4 percent while net income increased 13 percent.
Sales of consumer financial products increased across-the-board, as the business leveraged its leading franchises in both banking centers and online capabilities. Franchise sales totaled 12 million products, an increase of 9 percent from the third quarter of 2005, including record performance in checking, debit and online sales.
On a GAAP basis, deposit balances increased by $20 billion or 6 percent, driven by the addition of the MBNA deposit portfolio. On a pro forma basis, deposits declined 2 percent from a year ago as the company continued to balance growth and profitability.
E-Commerce sales grew to more than 2 million units in the quarter, driven by checking, savings and credit card sales. Bankofamerica.com now has 20.6 million active users and 10.8 million active bill-payers.

Global Corporate and Investment Banking
 
Revenue increased 14 percent to $6.02 billion from $5.29 billion. Net income rose 24 percent to $1.92 billion. Most of the increase was due to the $720 million pre-tax gain from the sale of Bank of America's Brazilian operations. Excluding the impact of the Brazil transaction, revenue grew by 1 percent and net income declined by 4 percent, or $67 million.
Besides Brazil, the growth in revenue was driven by increased results in Global Treasury Services and strong growth in loans and deposits, which was somewhat offset by spread compression and lower equity investment gains. Excluding Brazil, net income was lower due to increased personnel costs, reflecting the build out of capital markets services and products.
Capital Markets and Advisory Services benefited from increased sales and trading results in Credit Products and Structured Products, which were offset by lower results in Liquid Products.

Global Wealth and Investment Management
 
Revenue increased 3 percent, driven by higher asset management fees and continued migration of qualified banking relationships from Global Consumer and Small Business Banking into Premier Banking. Net income decreased slightly due to higher personnel expenses associated with an aggressive hiring strategy of investment professionals.
Asset management fees increased 9 percent from the third quarter of 2005 due to continued strong performance at Columbia Management. Higher assets under management balances were driven by total net asset inflows of $47 billion, in addition to increased market values of $13 billion.

All Other
All Other reflected $52 million of net income for the quarter, compared to a net loss of $120 million in the third quarter of 2005. In 2005, All Other was negatively affected by the results of the ALM process, including the change in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges that did not qualify for SFAS 133. The third quarter of 2006 included losses on sales of debt securities of $483 million, compared to gains on sales of debt securities of $13 million in the third quarter of 2005. Equity investment gains in this segment were $687 million compared to $640 million in the third quarter of 2005.

Supplemental Financial Data
 
Reconciliation to GAAP financial measures
Supplemental financial data presented on an operating basis is a basis of presentation not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) that excludes merger and restructuring charges. We believe that the exclusion of merger and restructuring charges, which represent events outside our normal operations, provides a meaningful period-to-period comparison and is more reflective of normalized operations.
Shareholder value added (SVA) is a key measure of performance not defined by GAAP that is used in managing our growth strategy orientation and strengthening our focus on generating long-term growth and shareholder value. SVA is used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity (i.e., capital) at the individual unit level and is an integral component in the analytics for resource allocation. Using SVA as a performance measure places specific focus on whether incremental investments generate returns in excess of the costs of capital associated with those investments. Each business segment has a goal for growth in SVA reflecting the individual segment's business and customer strategy.
Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. See the tables below for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the quarters ended September 30, 2006, June 30, 2006, March 31, 2006, December 31, 2005, and September 30, 2005, and the nine months ended September 30, 2006 and 2005.
