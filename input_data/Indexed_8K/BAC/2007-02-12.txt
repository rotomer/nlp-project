(e) Distributions on the Trust Securities of a Class shall be made by the Paying Agent from the Payment Account and shall be payable on each Distribution Date only to the extent that the Trust has funds then on hand and available in the Payment Account from the Corresponding Assets of such Class for the payment of such Distributions.

Section 4.2
Redemption.
(a) Mandatory redemption of Preferred HITS upon redemption of Preferred Stock. On the maturity of the Notes or each Preferred Stock Redemption Date, the Trust will be required to redeem a Like Amount of Preferred HITS and Common Securities at the redemption price for the Preferred Stock (it being understood and agreed that, because (i) the Preferred Stock will not become Trust Property until the Stock Purchase Date, and (ii) on the Stock Purchase Date, subject to Section 4.8, each $1,000 Liquidation Amount of Treasury HITS will automatically become $1,000 Liquidation Amount of Preferred HITS, without any action by or on behalf of Holders being necessary, no redemption of Preferred HITS, Treasury HITS or Common Securities will occur prior to the Stock Purchase Date).
(b) Mandatory redemption of Corporate HITS. On each Note Redemption Date, the Trust will be required to redeem a Like Amount of Corporate HITS at the Note Redemption Price (it being understood and agreed that, because (i) the Notes by their terms, except in the case of a Special Event, are not redeemable prior to March 15, 2017, (ii) the Trust is required to redeem the Corporate HITS in kind after the Stock Purchase Date pursuant to Section 4.2(c) if there is a Successful Remarketing, and (iii) the Sponsor has the right to cause the Trust to redeem the Corporate HITS in kind after the Stock Purchase Date pursuant to Section 4.2 if there is a Failed Remarketing or if the Stock Purchase Contracts terminate, a redemption of Corporate HITS other than in kind pursuant to such Section 4.2(c) will only occur after March 15, 2017 and only if there is a Failed Remarketing and the Sponsor does not exercise its right to cause the Trust to redeem the Corporate HITS in kind).
(c) Redemption in connection with a Remarketing. If a Successful Remarketing occurs, then promptly after the Remarketing Settlement Date the Trust shall redeem the Corporate HITS, in whole but not in part, in kind by exchanging for each Corporate HITS a Like Amount of Notes. If a Failed Remarketing occurs but on the Stock Purchase Date there is no Deferred Note Interest Amount outstanding, then promptly after the Stock Purchase Date the Trust shall redeem the Corporate HITS, in whole but not in part, in kind by exchanging for each Corporate HITS a Like Amount of Notes. If a Failed Remarketing occurs and there is a Deferred Note Interest Amount outstanding on the Stock Purchase Date, or if the Stock Purchase Contracts terminate in accordance with the terms of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement prior to a Stock Purchase Date occurring, then the Sponsor may instruct the Trust at any time thereafter when no Deferred Note Interest Amount is outstanding to redeem the Corporate HITS, in whole but not in part, in kind by exchanging for each Corporate HITS a Like Amount of Notes. Any such redemption will be effected by Book-Entry Transfer of Notes in global form if the Notes then settle and clear through the Clearing Agency, and if the Notes do not then settle and clear through the Clearing Agency by delivery of definitive certificates evidencing the Notes to the Holders of Corporate HITS.

Notice of redemption shall be given by the Property Trustee by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 15 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date to each Holder of Trust Securities to be redeemed, at such Holder's address appearing in the Security Register.

(f) Redemption Price. In the case of a redemption of Preferred HITS and Common Securities pursuant to Section 4.2(a) or Corporate HITS pursuant to Section 4.2(b), in each case for payment of a cash Redemption Price:
(i) The Trust Securities redeemed on each Redemption Date shall be redeemed at the Redemption Price with the proceeds from the contemporaneous redemption of a Like Amount of Preferred Stock or Notes, as applicable. Redemptions of the Trust Securities shall be made and the Redemption Price shall be payable on each Redemption Date only to the extent that the Trust has funds then on hand and available in the Payment Account from the Corporation's redemption of Preferred Stock or Notes, as applicable, for the payment of such Redemption Price.

With respect to HITS that are not Book-Entry HITS, the Property Trustee, subject to Section 4.2(e)(i), will irrevocably deposit with the Paying Agent, to the extent available therefor, funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price and will give the Paying Agent

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Distributions payable on or prior to the Redemption Date for any Trust Securities called for redemption shall be payable to the Holders of such Trust Securities as they appear on the Securities Register for the Trust Securities on the relevant record dates for the related Distribution Dates. If notice of redemption shall have been given and funds deposited as required, then upon the date of such deposit, all rights of Holders holding Trust Securities so called for redemption will cease, except the right of such Holders to receive the Redemption Price and any Distribution payable in respect of the Trust Securities on or prior to the Redemption Date, but without interest, and such Trust Securities will cease to be outstanding. In the event that payment of the Redemption Price in respect of any Trust Securities called for redemption is improperly withheld or refused and not paid either by the Trust or by the Sponsor pursuant to the Guarantee Agreements, Distributions on such Trust Securities will continue to accumulate, as set forth in Section 4.1, from the Redemption Date originally established by the Trust for such Trust Securities to the date such Redemption Price is actually paid, in which case the actual payment date will be the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the Redemption Price.
(iii) Subject to Section 4.3(a), if less than all the Outstanding Preferred HITS and Common Securities are to be redeemed on a Redemption Date, then the aggregate Liquidation Amount of Preferred HITS and Common Securities to be redeemed shall be allocated to the Common Securities and the Preferred HITS being redeemed based upon the relative Liquidation Amounts of such classes. The particular Preferred HITS to be redeemed shall be selected on a basis based upon their respective Liquidation Amounts not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Property Trustee from the Outstanding Preferred HITS not previously called for redemption by any method the Property Trustee deems fair and appropriate, that so long as the Preferred HITS are in book-entry form, such selection shall be made in accordance with the customary procedures for the Clearing Agency for the Preferred HITS. The Property Trustee shall promptly notify the Securities Registrar in writing of the Preferred HITS selected for redemption and, in the case of any Preferred HITS selected for partial redemption, the Liquidation Amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Declaration, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Preferred HITS shall relate, in the case of any Preferred HITS redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the aggregate Liquidation Amount of Preferred HITS that has been or is to be redeemed.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Upon receipt by the Property Trustee of written notice declaring such an acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, by Holders of any part of the HITS of the Affected Classes a record date shall be established for determining Holders of Outstanding HITS of the Affected Classes entitled to join in such notice, which record date shall be at the close of business on the day the Property Trustee receives such notice.

Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder, or a proxy of a Holder, from giving, after expiration of such 90-day period, a new written notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, as the case may be, that is identical to a written notice that has been canceled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, in which event a new record date shall be established pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.16(b).

Section 9.4
Liquidation.
(a) If an Early Dissolution Event specified in clause (a) of Section 9.2 occurs, the Trust shall be liquidated by the Property Trustee and the Regular Trustees as expeditiously as the Property Trustee and the Regular Trustees determine to be possible by distributing, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust as provided by applicable law, to each Holder of HITS of each Class a Like Amount of Corresponding Assets as of the date of such distribution, subject to Section 9.4(d). If an Early Dissolution Event specified in clause (c) of Section 9.2 occurs, because such Early Dissolution Event is also an Early Settlement Event, unless otherwise required by applicable law the Trust will not be liquidated until after the Stock Purchase Date but, commencing promptly after the Stock Purchase Date, the Trust shall be liquidated by the Property Trustee and the Regular Trustees as expeditiously as the Property Trustee and the Regular Trustees determine to be possible by distributing, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust as provided by applicable law, to each Holder of HITS of each Class a Like Amount of Corresponding Assets as of the date of such distribution, subject to Section 9.4(d). Notice of liquidation shall be given by the Property Trustee or the Regular Trustees by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 15 nor more than 60 days prior to the Liquidation Date to each Holder of HITS of each Class at such Holder's address appearing in the Securities Register. All such notices of liquidation shall:
(i) state the CUSIP Number of the Trust Securities of each Class;
(ii) state the Liquidation Date;
(iii) state that from and after the Liquidation Date, the Trust Securities of such Class will no longer be deemed to be Outstanding and any Trust Securities Certificates not surrendered for exchange will be deemed to represent a Like Amount of Corresponding Assets as of the date of such distribution, or if Section 9.4(d) applies, a right to receive a Liquidation Distribution; and
(iv) provide such information with respect to the mechanics by which Holders may exchange Trust Securities Certificates of such Class for Corresponding Assets, or if Section 9.4(d) applies, receive a Liquidation Distribution, as the Property Trustee (after consultation with the Regular Trustees) shall deem appropriate.
(b) Except where Section 9.2(e) or 9.4(d) applies, in order to effect the liquidation of the Trust and distribution of the Corresponding Assets to Holders, the Property Trustee, either itself acting as exchange agent or through the appointment of a separate exchange agent, shall establish a record date for such distribution (which shall be not more than 30 days prior to the Liquidation Date) and, establish such procedures as it shall deem appropriate to effect the distribution of Corresponding Assets in exchange for the Outstanding Trust Securities Certificates of the related Classes.
(c) Except where Section 9.2(e) or 9.4(d) applies, after the Liquidation Date, (i) the Trust Securities will no longer be deemed to be Outstanding, (ii) if the Corresponding Assets for a Class of HITS are Notes or shares of Preferred Stock, certificates representing a Like Amount of Notes or Preferred Stock (or fractional interests in or depositary shares for Preferred Stock) will be issued to Holders of Trust Securities Certificates of the relevant Classes, upon surrender of such certificates to the exchange agent for exchange, and where Pledged Treasury Securities are Corresponding Assets, Pledged Treasury Securities will be delivered by Book-Entry Transfer to Holders upon surrender of such certificates, (iii) any Trust Securities Certificates not so surrendered for exchange will be deemed to represent a Like Amount of Corresponding Assets of the applicable Class until such certificates are so surrendered (and until such certificates are so surrendered, no payments of interest, principal, dividends, redemption price or otherwise will be made to Holders of Trust Securities Certificates with respect to such Corresponding Assets) and (iv) all rights of Holders holding Trust Securities will cease, except the right of such Holders to receive Corresponding Assets upon surrender of Trust Securities Certificates.

(d) If, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 9.4, whether because of an order for dissolution entered by a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, distribution of the Corresponding Assets in the manner provided herein is determined by the Property Trustee and the Regular Trustees not to be practical, or if an Early Dissolution Event specified in clause (e) of Section 9.2 occurs, the Trust Property shall be liquidated, and the Trust's affairs wound-up, by the Property Trustee and the Regular Trustees in such manner as the Property Trustee and the Regular Trustees determine. In such event, upon the winding-up of the Trust except with respect to an Early Dissolution Event specified in clause (e) of Section 9.2, Holders will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Trust available for distribution to Holders, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust as provided by applicable law, an amount equal to the Liquidation Amount per Trust Security plus accumulated and unpaid Distributions thereon to the date of payment (such amount being the ""). If, upon any such winding-up, the Liquidation Distribution can be paid only in part because the Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then, subject to the next succeeding sentence, the amounts payable by the Trust on the Trust Securities shall be paid on a basis (based upon Liquidation Amounts), except that the right of Holders of the Common Securities to receive Liquidation Distributions will be subordinated to the right of Holders of HITS to receive Liquidation Distributions as provided in Section 4.3(c).

(ii) the Distributions payable on each Corporate HITS Distribution Date for the related Distribution Period will be at a rate per annum applied to the Liquidation Amount per Corporate HITS equal to the Corporate HITS Distribution Rate for such Distribution Period, with the consequence that the amount of the Distribution for each $1,000 of Corporate HITS payable on each Corporate HITS Distribution Date is equal to the amount of interest payable on or accrued to (as applicable) such Distribution Date on a Like Amount of Notes; and

(a) Mandatory redemption of Preferred HITS upon redemption of Preferred Stock. On the maturity of the Notes or each Preferred Stock Redemption Date, the Trust will be required to redeem a Like Amount of Preferred HITS and Common Securities at the redemption price for the Preferred Stock (it being understood and agreed that, because (i) the Preferred Stock will not become Trust Property until the Stock Purchase Date, and (ii) on the Stock Purchase Date, subject to Section 4.8, each $1,000 Liquidation Amount of Treasury HITS will automatically become $1,000 Liquidation Amount of Preferred HITS, without any action by or on behalf of Holders being necessary, no redemption of Preferred HITS, Treasury HITS or Common Securities will occur prior to the Stock Purchase Date).
(b) Mandatory redemption of Corporate HITS. On each Note Redemption Date, the Trust will be required to redeem a Like Amount of Corporate HITS at the Note Redemption Price (it being understood and agreed that, because (i) the Notes by their terms, except in the case of a Special Event, are not redeemable prior to March 15, 2017, (ii) the Trust is required to redeem the Corporate HITS in kind after the Stock Purchase Date pursuant to Section 4.2(c) if there is a Successful Remarketing, and (iii) the Sponsor has the right to cause the Trust to redeem the Corporate HITS in kind after the Stock Purchase Date pursuant to Section 4.2 if there is a Failed Remarketing or if the Stock Purchase Contracts terminate, a redemption of Corporate HITS other than in kind pursuant to such Section 4.2(c) will only occur after March 15, 2017 and only if there is a Failed Remarketing and the Sponsor does not exercise its right to cause the Trust to redeem the Corporate HITS in kind).
(c) Redemption in connection with a Remarketing. If a Successful Remarketing occurs, then promptly after the Remarketing Settlement Date the Trust shall redeem the Corporate HITS, in whole but not in part, in kind by exchanging for each Corporate HITS a Like Amount of Notes. If a Failed Remarketing occurs but on the Stock Purchase Date there is no Deferred Note Interest Amount outstanding, then promptly after the Stock Purchase Date the Trust shall redeem the Corporate HITS, in whole but not in part, in kind by exchanging for each Corporate HITS a Like Amount of Notes. If a Failed Remarketing occurs and there is a Deferred Note Interest Amount outstanding on the Stock Purchase Date, or if the Stock Purchase Contracts terminate in accordance with the terms of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement prior to a Stock Purchase Date occurring, then the Sponsor may instruct the Trust at any time thereafter when no Deferred Note Interest Amount is outstanding to redeem the

(d) Redemption in Connection with a Special Event. At any time within 90 days after a Tax Event, Capital Treatment Event or an Investment Company Event, the Corporation shall have the right to redeem, in whole but not in part, the Notes at the Note Redemption Price.
(e) Notice of redemption. Notice of redemption shall be given by the Property Trustee by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 15 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date to each Holder of Trust Securities to be redeemed, at such Holder's address appearing in the Security Register. All notices of redemption shall state:

(ii) unless the redemption is a redemption of Corporate HITS in kind pursuant to Section 4.2(c), the Redemption Price or if the Redemption Price cannot be calculated prior to the time the notice is required to be sent, the estimate of the Redemption Price together with a statement that it is an estimate and that the actual Redemption Price will be calculated on the third Business Day prior to the Redemption Date (and if an estimate is provided, a further notice shall be sent of the actual Redemption Price on the date that such Redemption Price is calculated);
(iii) the CUSIP number or CUSIP numbers of the HITS affected;
(iv) if less than all the Outstanding Trust Securities are to be redeemed, the identification and the aggregate Liquidation Amount of the particular Trust Securities of the relevant Class to be redeemed;

(vi) if the HITS Certificates are not Book-Entry HITS Certificates on the Redemption Date, the place or places where the HITS Certificates are to be surrendered for the payment of the Redemption Price.
(f) Redemption Price. In the case of a redemption of Preferred HITS and Common Securities pursuant to Section 4.2(a) or Corporate HITS pursuant to Section 4.2(b), in each case for payment of a cash Redemption Price:
(i) The Trust Securities redeemed on each Redemption Date shall be redeemed at the Redemption Price with the proceeds from the contemporaneous redemption of a Like Amount of Preferred Stock or Notes, as applicable.

With respect to HITS that are not Book-Entry HITS, the Property Trustee, subject to Section 4.2(e)(i), will irrevocably deposit with the Paying Agent, to the extent available therefor, funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price and will give the Paying Agent irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of the HITS upon surrender of their HITS Certificates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Distributions payable on or prior to the Redemption Date for any Trust Securities called for redemption shall be payable to the Holders of such Trust Securities as they appear on the Securities Register for the Trust Securities on the relevant record dates for the related Distribution Dates. If notice of redemption shall have been given and funds deposited as required, then upon the date of such deposit, all rights of Holders holding Trust Securities so called for redemption will cease, except the right of such Holders to receive the Redemption Price and any Distribution payable in respect of the Trust Securities on or prior to the Redemption Date, but without interest, and such Trust Securities will cease to be outstanding. In the event that payment of the Redemption Price in respect of any Trust Securities called for redemption is improperly withheld or refused and not paid either by the Trust or by the Sponsor pursuant to the Guarantee Agreements, Distributions on such Trust Securities will continue to accumulate, as set forth in Section 4.1, from the Redemption Date originally established by the Trust for such Trust Securities to the date such Redemption Price is actually paid, in which case the actual payment date will be the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the Redemption Price.

The particular Preferred HITS to be redeemed shall be selected on a basis based upon their respective Liquidation Amounts not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Property Trustee from the Outstanding Preferred HITS not previously called for redemption by any method the Property Trustee deems fair and appropriate, that so long as the Preferred HITS are in book-entry form, such selection shall be made in accordance with the customary procedures for the Clearing Agency for the Preferred HITS. The Property Trustee shall promptly notify the Securities Registrar in writing of the Preferred HITS selected for redemption and, in the case of any Preferred HITS selected for partial redemption, the Liquidation Amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Declaration, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Preferred HITS shall relate, in the case of any Preferred HITS redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the aggregate Liquidation Amount of Preferred HITS that has been or is to be redeemed.

Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Declaration relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustees shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 8.1. To the extent that, at law or in equity, a Trustee has duties and liabilities relating to the Trust or to the Holders, such Trustee shall not be liable to the Trust or to any Holder for such Trustee's good faith reliance on the provisions of this Declaration. Except as otherwise required by the Trust Indenture Act and the Commission's rules thereunder applicable to indentures qualified under such Act, the provisions of this Declaration, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of the Trustees otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Sponsor and the Holders to replace such other duties and liabilities of the Trustees.
(b) All payments made by the Property Trustee or a Paying Agent in respect of the Trust Securities shall be made only from the revenue and proceeds from the Trust Property and only to the extent that there shall be sufficient revenue or proceeds from the Trust Property to enable the Property Trustee or a Paying Agent to make payments in accordance with the terms hereof. Each Holder, by its acceptance of a Trust Security, agrees that it will look solely to the revenue and proceeds from the Trust Property to the extent legally available for distribution to it as herein provided and that the Trustees are not personally liable to such Holder for any amount distributable in respect of any Trust Security or for any other liability in respect of any Trust Security. This Section 8.1(b) does not limit the liability of the Trustees expressly set forth elsewhere in this Declaration or, in the case of the Property Trustee, in the Trust Indenture Act.
(c) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Property Trustee shall enforce this Declaration and the Transaction Agreements for the benefit of the Holders.
(d) The Property Trustee, before the occurrence of any Event of Default and after the curing of all Events of Default that may have occurred, shall undertake to perform only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Declaration (including pursuant to Section 12.10), and no implied covenants shall be read into this Declaration against the Property Trustee. If an Event of Default has occurred (that has not been cured or waived pursuant to Section 5.7 of the Base Indenture), the Property Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Declaration, and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise thereof, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.
(e) No provision of this Declaration shall be construed to relieve the Property Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:
(i) prior to the occurrence of any Event of Default and after the curing or waiving of all such Events of Default that may have occurred:
(A) the duties and obligations of the Property Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Declaration (including pursuant to Section 12.10), and the Property Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Declaration (including pursuant to Section 12.10); and
(B) in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Property Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Declaration; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions that by any provision hereof or of the Trust Indenture Act are specifically required to be furnished to the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Declaration;

(vii) subject to Section 8.1(c), no provision of this Declaration shall require the Property Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if the Property Trustee shall have reasonable grounds for believing that the repayment of such funds or liability is not reasonably assured to it under the terms of this Declaration or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
(f) The Regular Trustees shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the other Trustees or the Sponsor with their respective duties under this Declaration, nor shall either Regular Trustee be liable for the default or misconduct of any other Trustee or the Sponsor.

(iv) provide such information with respect to the mechanics by which Holders may exchange Trust Securities Certificates of such Class for Corresponding Assets, or if Section 9.4(d) applies, receive a Liquidation Distribution, as the Property Trustee (after consultation with the Regular Trustees) shall deem appropriate.

Payment of Deferred Interest

termination of such Extension Period in an amount so that the net proceeds of such sale, when applied to such deferred payments of interest, will cause such unpaid deferred interest payments to be paid in full and (unless the Federal Reserve instructs otherwise) apply the proceeds of such sale to pay the deferred amounts (provided that the Company shall not in any event be required to pay interest on the Notes at a time when the payment of such interest would violate the terms of any securities issued by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or the terms of a contract binding on the Company or any of its subsidiaries); , , that the forgoing covenant shall not apply with respect to any interest on the Notes that is deferred and unpaid as of the date of consummation of any business combination where, immediately following its consummation, more than 50% of the surviving entity's voting stock is owned by the shareholders of the other party to the business combination; , that the surviving entity may pay any deferred and unpaid interest with any available funds on the next Interest Payment Date following the date of consummation of the business combination or if later, at any time within 90 days following the date of consummation of the business combination.

(c) In the event of (i) any insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization, readjustment, composition or other similar proceeding with respect to the Company, its creditors or its property, (ii) any proceeding for the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the Company, whether or not involving insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings, (iii) any assignment by the Company for the benefit of creditors, or (iv) any other marshalling of the assets of the Company:
(A) all Senior and Subordinated Debt (including any interest thereon accruing after the commencement of any such proceedings) shall first be paid in full before any payment or distribution, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be made to the Property Trustee in respect of Contract Payments;
(B) any payment or distribution, whether in cash, securities or other property that would otherwise (but for these subordination provisions) be payable or deliverable in respect of Contract Payments shall be paid or delivered directly to the holders of Senior and Subordinated Debt in accordance with the priorities then existing among such holders until all Senior and Subordinated Debt (including any interest thereon accruing after the commencement of any such proceedings) shall have been paid in full;
(C) after payment in full of all sums owing with respect to Senior and Subordinated Debt, the Property Trustee, together with the holders of any obligations of the Company ranking on a parity with the Contract Payments, shall be entitled to be paid from the remaining assets of the Company the amounts at the time due and owing on account of unpaid Contract Payments and interest thereon and such other obligations before any payment or other distribution, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be made on account of any capital stock of the Company or any obligations of the Company ranking junior to the Company's obligations to make Contract Payments under the Stock Purchase Contracts and such other obligations; and
 
(D) in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment or distribution of any character or any security, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be received by the Property Trustee or the Trust in contravention of any of the terms hereof such payment or distribution or security shall be received in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid over or delivered and transferred to, the holders of the Senior and Subordinated Debt at the time outstanding in accordance with the priorities then existing among such holders for application to the payment of all Senior and Subordinated Debt remaining unpaid, to the extent necessary to pay all such Senior and Subordinated Debt in full. In the event of the failure of the Property Trustee or the Trust to endorse or assign any such payment, distribution or security, each holder of Senior and Subordinated Debt is hereby irrevocably authorized to endorse or assign the same.
(d) For purposes of Sections 2.6(b) through (l), the words "cash, securities or other property" shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of the Company as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other Person provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment, the payment of which is subordinated at least to the extent provided in Sections 2.6(b) through (l) with respect to such Contract Payments on the Stock Purchase Contracts to the payment of all Senior and Subordinated Debt that may at the time be outstanding; that (i) the indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness, as the case may be, that constitutes Senior and Subordinated Debt is assumed by the Person, if any, resulting from any such reorganization or readjustment, and (ii) the rights of the holders of the Senior and Subordinated Debt are not, without the consent of each such holder adversely affected thereby, altered by such reorganization or readjustment.
provided
(e) Any failure by the Company to make any payment on or perform any other obligation under Senior and Subordinated Debt, other than any indebtedness incurred by the Company or assumed or guaranteed, directly or indirectly, by the Company for money borrowed (or any deferral, renewal, extension or refunding thereof) or any indebtedness or obligation as to which the provisions of Sections 2.6(b) through (l) shall have been waived by the Company in the instrument or instruments by which the Company incurred, assumed, guaranteed or otherwise created such indebtedness or obligation, shall not be deemed a default or event of default if (i) the Company shall be disputing its obligation to make such payment or perform such obligation and (ii) either (A) no final judgment relating to such dispute shall have been issued against the Company that is in full force and effect and is not subject to further review, including a judgment that has become final by reason of the expiration of the time within which a party may seek further appeal or review, or (B) in the event a judgment that is subject to further review or appeal has been issued, the Company shall in good faith be prosecuting an appeal or other proceeding for review and a stay of execution shall have been obtained pending such appeal or review.
(f) Subject to the irrevocable payment in full of all Senior and Subordinated Debt, the Property Trustee on behalf of the Trust shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with the holders of all obligations of the Company that by their express terms are subordinated to Senior and Subordinated Debt of the Company to the same extent as payment of the Contract Payments in respect of the Stock Purchase Contracts is subordinated and that are entitled to like rights of subrogation) to the rights of the holders of Senior and Subordinated Debt to receive payments or distributions of cash, securities or other property of the Company applicable to the Senior and Subordinated Debt until all such Contract Payments owing on the Stock Purchase Contracts shall
 
be paid in full, and as between the Company, its creditors other than holders of such Senior and Subordinated Debt and the Property Trustee, no such payment or distribution made to the holders of Senior and Subordinated Debt by virtue of Sections 2.6(b) through (l) that otherwise would have been made to the Property Trustee shall be deemed to be a payment by the Company on account of such Senior and Subordinated Debt, it being understood that the provisions of Sections 2.6(b) through (l) are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Property Trustee, on the one hand, and the holders of Senior and Subordinated Debt, on the other hand.
(g) Nothing contained in Sections 2.6(b) through (l) or elsewhere in this Agreement is intended to or shall impair, as among the Company, its creditors other than the holders of Senior and Subordinated Debt and the Property Trustee, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the Property Trustee such Contract Payments on the Stock Purchase Contracts as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights of the Property Trustee and creditors of the Company other than the holders of Senior and Subordinated Debt, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Property Trustee from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Agreement, subject to the rights, if any, under Sections 2.6(b) through (l), of the holders of Senior and Subordinated Debt in respect of cash, securities or other property of the Company received upon the exercise of any such remedy.
(h) Upon payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in Sections 2.6(b) through (l), the Property Trustee shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction in which any such dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization proceeding affecting the affairs of the Company is pending or upon a certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, conservator, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidating trustee or other Person making any payment or distribution, delivered to the Property Trustee, for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of the Senior and Subordinated Debt and other indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to Sections 2.6(b) through (l).
(i) The Property Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself to be a holder of Senior and Subordinated Debt (or a trustee or representative on behalf of such holder) to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of Senior and Subordinated Debt or a trustee or representative on behalf of any such holder or holders. In the event that the Property Trustee determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior and Subordinated Debt to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to Section 2.6(b) through (l), the Property Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Property Trustee as to the amount of Senior and Subordinated Debt held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under Sections 2.6(b) through (l), and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Property Trustee may defer payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment.
 
(j) Nothing contained in Sections 2.6(b) through (l) shall affect the obligations of the Company to make, or prevent the Company from making, payment of the Contract Payments, except as otherwise provided in Sections 2.6(b) through (l).
(k) The Bank of New York, or any successor Property Trustee, in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Section with respect to any Senior and Subordinated Debt at the time held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior and Subordinated Debt and nothing in this Agreement shall deprive The Bank of New York, or any successor Property Trustee of any of its rights as such holder.
(l) No right of any present or future holder of any Senior and Subordinated Debt to enforce the subordination herein shall at any time or in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any noncompliance by the Company with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Agreement, regardless of any knowledge thereof that any such holder may have or be otherwise charged with.
(m) Nothing in this Section 2.6 shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Property Trustee under or pursuant to Section 2.7.
(n) With respect to the holders of Senior and Subordinated Debt, (i) the duties and obligations of the Property Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement; (ii) the Property Trustee shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall, acting in good faith, mistakenly pay over or distribute to the Holders or to the Company or any other Person cash, securities or other property to which any holders of Senior and Subordinated Debt shall be entitled by virtue of this Section 2.6 or otherwise; (iii) no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Property Trustee; and (iv) the Property Trustee shall not be deemed to be a fiduciary as to such holders.
(o) Nothing in this Section 2.6 shall apply to any payment or distribution, whether in cash, securities or other property, made to, or paid over or distributed by, any Paying Agent in respect of Contract Payments or otherwise. The Paying Agent shall owe no duty, fiduciary or otherwise, to any holder of Senior and Subordinated Debt and shall not be liable to any holders of Senior and Subordinated Debt if it shall pay over or distribute to the Holders or to the Company or any other Person cash, securities or other property to which any holders of Senior and Subordinated Debt shall otherwise be entitled by virtue of this Section 2.6 or otherwise; and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Paying Agent.
Section 2.7 .
Deferral of Contract Payments
(a) The Company shall have the right (which will be exercised if so directed by the Federal Reserve), at any time prior to the Stock Purchase Date, to defer the payment of any or all of the Contract Payments otherwise payable on any Payment Date, but only if the Company shall give the Property Trustee and the Regular Trustees (with a copy to the Paying Agent) written notice of its election to defer each such deferred Contract Payment (specifying the amount to be deferred) at least ten Business Days prior to the earlier of (i) the next succeeding Payment Date or (ii) the date the Property Trustee and the Regular Trustees are required to give notice of any record date or Payment Date with respect to any class of HITS to the New York Stock Exchange

(c) In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Payments on the Stock Purchase Contracts and such deferral is continuing on the Stock Purchase Date, the Property Trustee will receive on the Stock Purchase Date in lieu of a cash payment, in addition to the shares of Preferred Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 2.3, Subordinated Notes that will (i) have a principal amount equal to the aggregate amount of Deferred Contract Payments at the Stock Purchase Date, (ii) mature on the later of March 15, 2015 or five years after commencement of the deferral period, (iii) bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to Three-Month LIBOR plus % (subject to deferral on the same basis as the Contract Payments), (iv) be subordinate and rank junior in right of payment to all of the Company's Senior and Subordinated Debt on the same basis as the Contract Payments, and (v) be redeemable at the option of the Company at any time or from time to time prior to their stated maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount thereof plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption; that the Company shall register such Subordinated Notes under the Securities Act prior to the delivery thereof to the Property Trustee unless they may be so delivered pursuant to an exemption or exception from registration thereunder.
    
provided

Section 3.4 .
Delay or Omission Not Waiver
No delay or omission of the Property Trustee to exercise any right upon a default or remedy upon a default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such right.

(D) in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment or distribution of any character or any security, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be received by the Property Trustee or the Trust in contravention of any of the terms hereof such payment or distribution or security shall be received in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid over or delivered and transferred to, the holders of the Senior and Subordinated Debt at the time outstanding in accordance with the priorities then existing among such holders for application to the payment of all Senior and Subordinated Debt remaining unpaid, to the extent necessary to pay all such Senior and Subordinated Debt in full. In the event of the failure of the Property Trustee or the Trust to endorse or assign any such payment, distribution or security, each holder of Senior and Subordinated Debt is hereby irrevocably authorized to endorse or assign the same.
(d) For purposes of Sections 2.6(b) through (l), the words "cash, securities or other property" shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of the Company as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other Person provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment, the payment of which is subordinated at least to the extent provided in Sections 2.6(b) through (l) with respect to such Contract Payments on the Stock Purchase Contracts to the payment of all Senior and Subordinated Debt that may at the time be outstanding; that (i) the indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness, as the case may be, that constitutes Senior and Subordinated Debt is assumed by the Person, if any, resulting from any such reorganization or readjustment, and (ii) the rights of the holders of the Senior and Subordinated Debt are not, without the consent of each such holder adversely affected thereby, altered by such reorganization or readjustment.
provided
(e) Any failure by the Company to make any payment on or perform any other obligation under Senior and Subordinated Debt, other than any indebtedness incurred by the Company or assumed or guaranteed, directly or indirectly, by the Company for money borrowed (or any deferral, renewal, extension or refunding thereof) or any indebtedness or obligation as to which the provisions of Sections 2.6(b) through (l) shall have been waived by the Company in the instrument or instruments by which the Company incurred, assumed, guaranteed or otherwise created such indebtedness or obligation, shall not be deemed a default or event of default if (i) the Company shall be disputing its obligation to make such payment or perform such obligation and (ii) either (A) no final judgment relating to such dispute shall have been issued against the Company that is in full force and effect and is not subject to further review, including a judgment that has become final by reason of the expiration of the time within which a party may seek further appeal or review, or (B) in the event a judgment that is subject to further review or appeal has been issued, the Company shall in good faith be prosecuting an appeal or other proceeding for review and a stay of execution shall have been obtained pending such appeal or review.
(f) Subject to the irrevocable payment in full of all Senior and Subordinated Debt, the Property Trustee on behalf of the Trust shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with the holders of all obligations of the Company that by their express terms are subordinated to Senior and Subordinated Debt of the Company to the same extent as payment of the Contract Payments in respect of the Stock Purchase Contracts is subordinated and that are entitled to like rights of subrogation) to the rights of the holders of Senior and Subordinated Debt to receive payments or distributions of cash, securities or other property of the Company applicable to the Senior and Subordinated Debt until all such Contract Payments owing on the Stock Purchase Contracts shall
 
be paid in full, and as between the Company, its creditors other than holders of such Senior and Subordinated Debt and the Property Trustee, no such payment or distribution made to the holders of Senior and Subordinated Debt by virtue of Sections 2.6(b) through (l) that otherwise would have been made to the Property Trustee shall be deemed to be a payment by the Company on account of such Senior and Subordinated Debt, it being understood that the provisions of Sections 2.6(b) through (l) are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Property Trustee, on the one hand, and the holders of Senior and Subordinated Debt, on the other hand.
(g) Nothing contained in Sections 2.6(b) through (l) or elsewhere in this Agreement is intended to or shall impair, as among the Company, its creditors other than the holders of Senior and Subordinated Debt and the Property Trustee, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the Property Trustee such Contract Payments on the Stock Purchase Contracts as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights of the Property Trustee and creditors of the Company other than the holders of Senior and Subordinated Debt, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Property Trustee from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Agreement, subject to the rights, if any, under Sections 2.6(b) through (l), of the holders of Senior and Subordinated Debt in respect of cash, securities or other property of the Company received upon the exercise of any such remedy.
(h) Upon payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in Sections 2.6(b) through (l), the Property Trustee shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction in which any such dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization proceeding affecting the affairs of the Company is pending or upon a certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, conservator, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidating trustee or other Person making any payment or distribution, delivered to the Property Trustee, for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of the Senior and Subordinated Debt and other indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to Sections 2.6(b) through (l).
(i) The Property Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself to be a holder of Senior and Subordinated Debt (or a trustee or representative on behalf of such holder) to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of Senior and Subordinated Debt or a trustee or representative on behalf of any such holder or holders. In the event that the Property Trustee determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior and Subordinated Debt to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to Section 2.6(b) through (l), the Property Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Property Trustee as to the amount of Senior and Subordinated Debt held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under Sections 2.6(b) through (l), and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Property Trustee may defer payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment.
 
(j) Nothing contained in Sections 2.6(b) through (l) shall affect the obligations of the Company to make, or prevent the Company from making, payment of the Contract Payments, except as otherwise provided in Sections 2.6(b) through (l).
(k) The Bank of New York, or any successor Property Trustee, in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Section with respect to any Senior and Subordinated Debt at the time held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior and Subordinated Debt and nothing in this Agreement shall deprive The Bank of New York, or any successor Property Trustee of any of its rights as such holder.
(l) No right of any present or future holder of any Senior and Subordinated Debt to enforce the subordination herein shall at any time or in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any noncompliance by the Company with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Agreement, regardless of any knowledge thereof that any such holder may have or be otherwise charged with.
(m) Nothing in this Section 2.6 shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Property Trustee under or pursuant to Section 2.7.
(n) With respect to the holders of Senior and Subordinated Debt, (i) the duties and obligations of the Property Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement; (ii) the Property Trustee shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall, acting in good faith, mistakenly pay over or distribute to the Holders or to the Company or any other Person cash, securities or other property to which any holders of Senior and Subordinated Debt shall be entitled by virtue of this Section 2.6 or otherwise; (iii) no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Property Trustee; and (iv) the Property Trustee shall not be deemed to be a fiduciary as to such holders.
(o) Nothing in this Section 2.6 shall apply to any payment or distribution, whether in cash, securities or other property, made to, or paid over or distributed by, any Paying Agent in respect of Contract Payments or otherwise. The Paying Agent shall owe no duty, fiduciary or otherwise, to any holder of Senior and Subordinated Debt and shall not be liable to any holders of Senior and Subordinated Debt if it shall pay over or distribute to the Holders or to the Company or any other Person cash, securities or other property to which any holders of Senior and Subordinated Debt shall otherwise be entitled by virtue of this Section 2.6 or otherwise; and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Paying Agent.
Section 2.7
Deferral of Contract Payments.
(a) The Company shall have the right (which will be exercised if so directed by the Federal Reserve), at any time prior to the Stock Purchase Date, to defer the payment of any or all of the Contract Payments otherwise payable on any Payment Date, but only if the Company shall give the Property Trustee and the Regular Trustees (with a copy to the Paying Agent) written notice of its election to defer each such deferred Contract Payment (specifying the amount to be deferred) at least ten Business Days prior to the earlier of (i) the next succeeding Payment Date or (ii) the date the Property Trustee and the Regular Trustees are required to give notice of any record date or Payment Date with respect to any class of HITS to the New York Stock Exchange
 
or other applicable self regulatory organization or to the Holders, but in any event not less than one Business Day prior to such record date. Any Contract Payments so deferred shall, to the extent permitted by law, accrue interest thereon at a rate of % per annum, compounding on each succeeding Payment Date, until paid in full (such deferred installments of Contract Payments, if any, together with the interest, if any, accrued thereon, being referred to herein as the "").

(c) In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Payments on the Stock Purchase Contracts and such deferral is continuing on the Stock Purchase Date, the Property Trustee will receive on the Stock Purchase Date in lieu of a cash payment, in addition to the shares of Preferred Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 2.3, Subordinated Notes that will (i) have a principal amount equal to the aggregate amount of Deferred Contract Payments at the Stock Purchase Date, (ii) mature on the later of March 15, 2015 or five years after commencement of the deferral period, (iii) bear interest at a rate of % per annum (subject to deferral on the same basis as the Contract Payments), (iv) be subordinate and rank junior in right of payment to all of the Company's Senior and Subordinated Debt on the same basis as the Contract Payments, and (v) be redeemable at the option of the Company at any time or from time to time prior to their stated maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount thereof plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption; that the Company shall register such Subordinated Notes under the Securities Act prior to the delivery thereof to the Property Trustee unless they may be so delivered pursuant to an exemption or exception from registration thereunder.
    
provided
(d) In the event the Company exercises its option to defer the payment of Contract Payments then, until the earlier of (x) the Termination Date or (y) the date on which the Company shall have either paid all Deferred Contract Payments to the Property Trustee in cash or repaid all amounts outstanding on the Subordinated Notes, the Company shall not (i) declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any shares of its capital stock, including its Preferred Stock, or make any guarantee payment with respect to the foregoing, other than:
(A) any repurchase, redemption or other acquisition of shares of the Company's capital stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more employees, officers, directors, consultants or independent contractors;
 
(B) any exchange, redemption or conversion of any class or series of the Company's capital stock, or the capital stock of one of its subsidiaries, for any other class or series of the Company's capital stock, or any class or series of the Company's indebtedness for any class or series of its capital stock;
(C) any purchase of fractional interests of the Company's capital stock pursuant to the acquisition, conversion or exchange provisions of such capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged; or
(D) payments in respect of the Company's guarantee related to the HITS executed for the benefit of the Holders of the HITS;
or (ii) make any payment of principal, interest or premium, if any, on, or repay, repurchase or redeem, any debt security of the Company that ranks in all respects with or junior in interest to the Notes (except for partial payments of interest pursuant to the terms of the Notes); or (iii) make any guarantee payments with respect to any guarantee by the Company of the debt securities of any subsidiary of the Company that by its terms ranks in all respects with or junior in interest to the Company's guarantee related to the HITS.
