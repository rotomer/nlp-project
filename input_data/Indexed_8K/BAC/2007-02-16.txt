1. .
Representations and Warranties
(a) The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each Underwriter that:
(i) The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-133852), which contains a base prospectus (the "Base Prospectus"), to be used in connection with the public offering and sale of the Securities. Such registration statement, as amended, including the financial statements, exhibits and schedules thereto, at each time of effectiveness under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Securities Act"), including any required information deemed to be a part thereof at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act"), is called the "Registration Statement." The term "Prospectus" shall mean the final prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, together with the Base Prospectus, that is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) after the date and time that this Agreement is executed and delivered by the parties hereto (the "Execution Time"). Any reference herein to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act; any reference to any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date of such Prospectus under the Exchange Act, and incorporated by reference in such Prospectus; and any reference to any amendment to the Registration Statement shall be deemed to refer to and include any annual report of the Company filed pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act after the effective date of the Registration Statement that is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement. All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements to either of the foregoing, shall include any copy thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR").
(ii) The term "Disclosure Package," as to each series of Securities, shall mean (A) the Base Prospectus; (B) the applicable issuer free writing prospectuses as defined in Rule 433 of the Securities Act (each, an "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus"), if any, identified in Schedule III hereto; (C) any other free writing prospectus that the parties hereto shall hereafter expressly agree in writing to treat as part of each Disclosure Package, and (D) the applicable Final Term Sheet (as defined herein), which also shall be identified in Schedule III hereto. As of 4:20 p.m. (Eastern time) on the date of this Agreement (the "Applicable Time"), each Disclosure Package did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The preceding sentence does not apply to statements in or omissions from a Disclosure Package based upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists only of the information described as such in Section 7(b) hereof (the "Underwriter Information").
(iii) As of the date hereof, when the Prospectus is first filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, when any supplement or amendment to the Prospectus is filed with the Commission, at the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) and, with respect to the Registration Statement in (A) and (B) below, as of the Applicable Time, (A) the Registration Statement is effective, the Registration Statement, as amended as of any such time, and the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of any such time, and the Indenture complied, complies or will comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (the "Trust Indenture Act"), and the Exchange Act, (B) the Registration Statement, as amended as of any such time, did not, does not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, and (C) the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of any such time, did not, does not and
 
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that the Company makes no representations or warranties as to (I) that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification of the Trustee (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee or (II) the Underwriter Information. The documents which are incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, each Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or from which information is so incorporated by reference, when they were filed with the Commission, complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, as applicable, and did not, when such documents were so filed, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Commission has not issued any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any order preventing or suspending the use of the Prospectus, and the Company is without knowledge that any proceedings have been instituted for either purpose.
(iv)(A) At the earliest time after the Company or another offering participant made a offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2) of the Securities Act) and (B) as of the date of the execution and delivery of this Agreement (with such date being used as a determination date for purposes of this clause (B)), the Company neither was nor is an Ineligible Issuer (as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act).
bona fide
(v) Neither any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus nor any Final Term Sheet, as of its issue date and at all subsequent times through the completion of the offering contemplated hereby or until any earlier date that the Company notified or notifies the Representatives as described in the next sentence, did not, does not, and will not include any information that conflicted, conflicts, or will conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement, including any document incorporated by reference therein or the Prospectus, that has not been superseded or modified. If at any time following issuance of the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and prior to the end of the Prospectus Delivery Period (as defined below), there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, the Company has promptly notified or will promptly notify the Representatives and has promptly amended or supplemented or will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict. The foregoing two sentences do not apply to statements in or omissions from an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus based upon and in conformity with Underwriter Information.
(vi) The Company has not distributed and will not distribute, prior to the later of the Closing Date and the completion of the Underwriters' distribution of the Securities, any offering material in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities other than the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus reviewed and consented to by the Underwriters and included in Schedule III hereto.
 
(vii)(A) At the time of filing the Registration Statement, (B) at the time of the most recent amendment thereto for the purposes of complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act (whether such amendment was by post-effective amendment, incorporated report filed pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or form of prospectus), (C) at the time the Company or any person acting on its behalf (within the meaning, for this clause only, of Rule 163(c) of the Securities Act) made any offer relating to the Securities in reliance on the exemption of Rule 163 of the Securities Act, and (D) at the Execution Time (with such date being used as the determination date for purposes of this clause (D)), the Company was and is a "well-known seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act. The Registration Statement is an "automatic shelf registration statement," as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act, the Company has not received from the Commission any notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) of the Securities Act objecting to use of the automatic shelf registration statement form and the Company has not otherwise ceased to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form.
(b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, represents and agrees that:
(i) it has not and will not, directly or indirectly, offer, sell or deliver any of the Securities or distribute the Prospectus or any other offering materials relating to the Securities in or from any jurisdiction except under circumstances that will, to the best of its knowledge and belief, result in compliance with any applicable laws and regulations thereof and that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, will not impose any obligations on the Company except as set forth herein; and
(ii) it will comply in all material respects with the selling restrictions set forth in the Prospectus under the caption "UnderwritingSelling Restrictions."
2. . Subject to the terms and conditions and in reliance upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, the Company agrees to sell to each Underwriter, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, at the purchase price set forth in Schedule I hereto, the principal amount of the Securities set forth opposite such Underwriter's name in Schedule II hereto.
Purchase and Sale
3. . Delivery of and payment for the Securities shall be made on the date and at the time specified in Schedule I hereto, which date and time may be postponed by agreement between the Representatives and the Company or as provided in Section 8 hereto (such date and time of delivery and payment for the Securities being herein called the "Closing Date"). Delivery of the Securities shall be made to the Representatives for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters against payment by the several Underwriters through the Representatives of the purchase price thereof in the manner set forth in Schedule I hereto. Unless otherwise agreed, certificates for the Securities shall be in book-entry form, and such certificates may be deposited with The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") or a custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC.
Delivery and Payment
 
4. . The Company agrees with the several Underwriters that:
Agreements
(a) During the period beginning on the Applicable Time and ending on the later of the Closing Date or such date, as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, the Prospectus is no longer required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Underwriter or dealer (except for delivery requirements imposed because such Underwriter or dealer is an affiliate of the Company), including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 (the "Prospectus Delivery Period"), the Company will not file any amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement to the Base Prospectus or a Disclosure Package (including the Prospectus) unless the Company has furnished you a copy for your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Company will cause the Prospectus to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 via EDGAR. The Company will advise the Representatives promptly (i) when the Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424, (ii) when any amendment to the Registration Statement or each Disclosure Package relating to a series of Securities shall have become effective, (iii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or amendment of or supplement to the Prospectus or a Disclosure Package or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose, and (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.
(b) If, at any time during the Prospectus Delivery Period, except with respect to any such delivery requirement imposed upon an affiliate of the Company in connection with any secondary market sales, any event occurs as a result of which each Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made or then prevailing, as the case may be, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend or supplement each Disclosure Package or the Prospectus to comply with the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, the Company promptly will prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the first sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 4, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment or supplement which will effect such compliance (including, if consented to by the Underwriters, by means of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus), and will give immediate notice, and confirm in writing, to the Underwriters to cease the solicitation of offers to purchase the Securities, and furnish to the Underwriters a reasonable number of copies of such amendment or supplement.
(c) The Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representatives as soon as practicable, but not later than 60 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement (in form complying with the provisions of Rule 158 under the Securities Act) covering a twelve-month period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the "effective date" (as defined in said Rule 158) of the Registration Statement.
 
(d) The Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and each amendment thereto which shall become effective on or prior to the Closing Date and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Securities Act, as many copies of the Prospectus and any amendments thereof and supplements thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request. The Company will pay the expenses of printing all documents relating to the offering.
(e) The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may reasonably designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will arrange for the determination of the legality of the Securities for purchase by investors; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general or unlimited service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
(f) Until the business day following the Closing Date, the Company will not, without the consent of the Representatives, offer or sell, or announce the offering of, any securities covered by the Registration Statement or by any other registration statement filed under the Securities Act; provided, however, the Company may, at any time, offer or sell or announce the offering of securities (i) covered by a registration statement on Form S-8 or (ii) covered by a registration statement on Form S-3 and (A) pursuant to which the Company issues securities under one of the Company's medium-term note programs (including, without limitation, the Company's Series K Medium-Term Note Program and the Company's InterNotes Program), (B) pursuant to which the Company issues securities for its dividend reinvestment plan, or (C) trust preferred securities to be issued in underwritten offerings (under Registration Statement No. 333-133852), or (iii) pursuant to which affiliates of the Company offer securities of the Company in secondary market transactions.
(g) As to each series of the Securities, the Company will prepare a final term sheet containing only a description of such series, in a form approved by the Representatives and contained in Schedule IV of this Agreement, and will file each such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act as promptly as possible, but in any case not later than the time required by such rule (each such term sheet, a "Final Term Sheet").
(h) The Company represents that it has not made and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Representatives, it will not make, any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433 of the Securities Act; provided that the prior written consent of the Representatives shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule III hereto. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (i) it has treated and will treat as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and (ii) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the
 
requirements of Rules 164 and 433 of the Securities Act applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping. The Company consents to the use by any Underwriter of a free writing prospectus that (a) is not an "issuer free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 433, and (b) contains only (i) information describing the preliminary terms of the Securities or their offering, (ii) information permitted by Rule 134 under the Securities Act or (iii) information that describes the final terms of the Securities or their offering and that is included in a Final Term Sheet of the Company contemplated in paragraph (g) above.
(i) If immediately prior to the third anniversary (the "Renewal Deadline") of the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, any of the Securities remain unsold by the Underwriters, the Company will file prior to the Renewal Deadline, if it has not already done so and is eligible to do so, a new automatic shelf registration statement relating to such Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives. If the Company is no longer eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the Company will prior to the Renewal Deadline, if it has not already done so, file a new shelf registration statement relating to such Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives, and will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 60 days after the Renewal Deadline. The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Securities to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement relating to the Securities. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be.
(j) If at any time when any of the Securities remain unsold by the Underwriters the Company receives from the Commission a notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) or otherwise ceases to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form, the Company will (i) promptly notify the Representatives, (ii) promptly file a new registration statement or post-effective amendment on the proper form relating to such Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives, (iii) use its best efforts to cause such registration statement of post-effective amendment to be declared effective and (iv) promptly notify the Representatives of such effectiveness. The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Securities to continue as contemplated in the registration statement that was the subject of the Rule 401(g)(2) notice or for which the Company has otherwise become ineligible. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.
(k) The Company agrees to pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) of the Securities Act without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) of the Securities Act.
5. . The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company contained herein as of the date hereof, as of the date of the effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement filed prior to the Closing Date (including the filing of any document incorporated by reference therein) and as of the

amendment or supplement thereto (other than as stated in (v) above), it has no reason to believe that such remaining portions of the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto as of the time it became effective, as of the Applicable Time or as of the date of such opinion, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that, subject to the foregoing with respect to financial statements and other financial, accounting and statistical information, each Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statement therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or that the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, as of its date or as of the date of such opinion contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(c) The Representatives shall have received from Morrison & Foerster LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Indenture, the Registration Statement, each Disclosure Package, and the Prospectus and any other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
(d) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by any Senior Vice President or Treasurer or any other authorized officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, each Disclosure Package, and the Prospectus and this Agreement and they are without knowledge that:
(i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are not true and correct with the same force and effect as though expressly made at and as of the Closing Date and the Company has not performed or complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to the Closing Date;
(ii) any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued or any proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened by the Commission; and
 
(iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included in each Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there has been any material adverse change or any development involving a prospective material adverse change in the condition (financial or other), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in each Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
(e) At the time this Agreement is executed, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to one or more of the Representatives), dated as of the date of this Agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that the response, if any, to Item 10 of the Registration Statement is correct insofar as it relates to them and stating in effect that:
(i) They are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
(ii) In their opinion, the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries audited by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission.
(iii) On the basis of procedures (but not an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) consisting of:
(a) Reading the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, the board of directors, executive committee and audit committee of the Company and the boards of directors of the Principal Subsidiary Bank as set forth in the minute books through a specified date not more than five business days prior to the date of delivery of such letter;
(b) Performing the procedures specified by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for a review of interim financial information as described in Statement of Accounting Standards No. 100, Interim Financial Information, on the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and reading the unaudited interim financial data, if any, for the period from the date of the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus to the date of the latest available interim financial data; and
 
(c) Making inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters regarding the specific items for which representations are requested below;
nothing has come to their attention as a result of the foregoing procedures that caused them to believe that:
(1) the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act and the published rules and regulations thereunder;
(2) any material modifications should be made to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles;
(3)(i) at the date of the latest available interim financial data and at the specified date not more than five business days prior to the date of the delivery of such letter, there was any change in the common stock and additional paid-in capital or the consolidated long-term debt (other than scheduled repayments of such debt) of the Company and the subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as compared with the amounts shown in the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or (ii) for the period from the date of the latest available financial data to a specified date not more than five business days prior to the delivery of such letter, there was any change in the common stock and additional paid-in capital or the consolidated long-term debt (other than scheduled repayments of such debt) of the Company and the subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, except in all instances for changes or decreases which the Registration Statement and the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur, or PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall state any specific changes or decreases.
(iv) The letter shall also state that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has carried out certain other specified procedures, not constituting an audit, with respect to certain amounts, percentages and financial information which are included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and which are specified by the Representatives and agreed to by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, and has found such amounts, percentages and financial information to be in agreement with the relevant accounting, financial and other records of the Company and its subsidiaries identified in such letter.
 
In addition, on the Closing Date, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters, dated the date of this Agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect set forth in this paragraph (e) and in Schedule I hereto.
(f) Subsequent to the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, each Disclosure Package, and the Prospectus, there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (e) of this Section 5 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or other), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement, each Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
(g) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
(h) On or after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date, (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities.
(i) There shall not have come to the Representatives' attention any facts that would cause the Representatives to believe that each Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, or the Prospectus, at the time it was required to be delivered to a purchaser of any of the Securities, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances existing at the time of such delivery, not misleading.
If any of the conditions specified in this Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and their counsel, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or telegraph confirmed in writing.

The Company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including (i) the preparation, printing, delivery to the Underwriters and filing of the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the Prospectus as originally filed and of each amendment or supplement thereto, (ii) the copying of this Agreement, (iii) the preparation, issuance and delivery of the certificates

7. .
Indemnification and Contribution
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which such Underwriter or such controlling person may become subject, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, including any information deemed to be a part thereof pursuant to Rule 430B under the Securities Act, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in each Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and to reimburse each Underwriter and each such controlling person for any and all expenses (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by Banc of America Securities LLC) as such expenses are reasonably incurred by such Underwriter or such controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense to the extent, but only to the extent, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with the Underwriter Information or arises out of or is based upon statements in or omissions from that
 
part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification of the Trustee (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee. The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 7(a) shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Company may otherwise have.
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (ii) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Base Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, and only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), in reliance upon and in conformity with the Underwriter Information; and to reimburse the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person for any legal and other expense reasonably incurred by the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action. The Company hereby acknowledges that the only information that the Underwriters have furnished to the Company expressly for use in the Registration Statement, each Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) are the names of the Underwriters and the statements set forth in the eighth and tenth paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus. The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 7(b) shall be in addition to any liabilities that each Underwriter may otherwise have.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure to so notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any liability other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense
 
thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (other than local counsel approved by the Representatives)), representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action) or (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
(d) The indemnifying party under this Section 7 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(e) If the indemnification provided for in Sections 7(a) through (d) is for any reason unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable
 
considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact or any such inaccurate or alleged inaccurate representation or warranty relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7(c), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim. The provisions set forth in Section 7(c) with respect to notice of commencement of any action shall apply if a claim for contribution is to be made under this Section 7; , , that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given in accordance with Section 7(c) for purposes of indemnification. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7(e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 7(e).
provided
however
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7(e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts received by such Underwriter in connection with the Securities underwritten by it. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7(e) are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their names in Schedule II. For purposes of this Section 7(e), each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (e), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, as contemplated by the preceding paragraph. However, the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (e).
 
8. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of the applicable series of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bear to the aggregate amount of such Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of the applicable series of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of such Securities, and if such non-defaulting Underwriters do not purchase all of such Securities, this Agreement will terminate as to such series of Securities without liability to any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 8, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement, each Disclosure Package and the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
Default by an Underwriter
9. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, or (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in the commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or material escalation of hostilities or other calamity or crisis (in the United States or elsewhere) the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable to market the Securities.
Termination
10. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Section 6 and 7 hereof and this Section 10 shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

(e) If at any time when the Prospectus is required by the Securities Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Preferred HITS, except with respect to any such delivery requirement imposed upon an affiliate of the Offerors in connection with any secondary market sales, any event shall occur as a result of which the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented will include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Offerors will, subject to paragraph (b) above, promptly prepare and file with the Commission such amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment which will effect such compliance (including, if consented to by the Representative, by means of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus), give immediate notice, and confirm in writing, to the Underwriters to cease the solicitation of offers to purchase the Preferred HITS, and furnish to the Underwriters a reasonable number of copies of such amendment or supplement.

(j) Until the business day following the Closing Date, neither the Company nor the Trust will, without the consent of the Representative, offer or sell, or announce the offering of, any additional securities covered by the Registration Statement or by any other registration statement filed under the Act; provided, however, the Company may, at any time, offer or sell or announce the offering of any securities (A) covered by a registration statement on Form S-8 or (B) covered by a registration statement on Form S-3 and (i) pursuant to which the Company issues securities under one of the Company's medium-term note programs (including, without limitation, the Company's Series K Medium-Term Notes program and the Company's InterNotes program), (ii) pursuant to which the Company issues securities for its dividend reinvestment plan, (iii) pursuant to which affiliates of the Company offer securities of the Company in secondary market transactions, (iv) 5.63% Fixed to Floating Rate Preferred Hybrid Income Trust Securities to be issued by BAC Capital Trust XIV pursuant to the Registration Statement in an underwritten offering in which the lead manager is Banc of America Securities LLC or (v) $2,000,000,000 Floating Rate Callable Senior Notes, due February 2010, to be issued by the Company pursuant to the Registration Statement in an underwritten offering in which the lead manager is Banc of America Securities LLC.

(l) The Offerors represent that each has not made, and agree that, unless they obtain the prior written consent of the Representative, they will not make, any offer relating to the Preferred HITS or the Related Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act) required to be filed by an Offeror with the Commission or retained by an Offeror under Rule 433 under the Securities Act; provided that the prior written consent of the Representative shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule C hereto. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representative is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Offerors agree that (i) they have treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and (ii) they have complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 under the Securities Act applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.

If the Company is no longer eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the Company and the Trust will prior to the Renewal Deadline, if it has not already done so, file a new shelf registration statement relating to the HITS, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives, and will use their best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 60 days after the Renewal Deadline. The Company and the Trust will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Preferred HITS to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement relating to the HITS. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be.
(n) If at any time when Preferred HITS remain unsold by the Underwriters or any of the Treasury HITS or Corporate HITS are outstanding, the Company or the Trust receives from the Commission a notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act or the Company otherwise ceases to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form, the Company will (i) promptly notify the Representatives, (ii) promptly file a new registration statement or post-effective amendment on the proper form relating to the HITS, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives, (iii) use its best efforts to cause such registration statement or post-effective amendment to be declared effective and (iv) promptly notify the Representatives of such effectiveness.

References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.

(3) On the basis of procedures (but not an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) consisting of:
(i) Reading the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, the board of directors, executive committee and audit committee of the Company and the board of directors of the Principal Subsidiary Bank as set forth in the minute books through a specified date not more than five business days prior to the date of delivery of such letter;

(i) At the Closing Time, the Preferred HITS shall have been authorized for listing on the New York Stock Exchange upon notice of issuance or the Offerors shall have filed a preliminary listing application with respect thereto with the New York Stock Exchange and shall not have received any information stating that the Preferred HITS will not be authorized for listing, subject to official notice of issuance and evidence of satisfactory distribution.

untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and to reimburse each Underwriter and each such controlling person for any and all expenses (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by Banc of America Securities LLC) as such expenses are reasonably incurred by such Underwriter or such controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense to the extent, but only to the extent, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with the Underwriter Information or arises out of or is based upon statements in or omissions from that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification of the Trustee (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Debt Trustee, Guarantee Trustee or Delaware Trustee. The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 6(a) shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Offerors may otherwise have.
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Trust, the Trustees, the Company, each of the Company's directors, each of the Company's officers and each of the Trustees who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Trust within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which the Company or the Trust, or any such director, officer, Trustee or controlling person may become subject, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (ii) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Base Prospectus, the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, and only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), in reliance upon and in conformity with the Underwriter Information; and to reimburse the Company, the Trust, or any such director, officer, Trustee or controlling person for any legal and other expense reasonably incurred by the Company, the Trust, or any such director, officer, Trustee or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action. The Offerors hereby acknowledges that the only information that the Underwriters have furnished to the Offerors expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) are the names of the Underwriters, the sentences relating to reallowances and concessions and the fifth, sixth and seventh paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting" in the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus. The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 6(b) shall be in addition to any liabilities that each Underwriter may otherwise have.
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 6, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure to so notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any liability other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 6 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (other than local counsel approved by the Representatives)), representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action or (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
(d) The indemnifying party under this Section 6 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(e) If the indemnification provided for in Sections 6(a) through (d) is for any reason unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Offerors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Preferred HITS and the Related Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Offerors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Offerors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Preferred HITS and the Related Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Preferred HITS and the Related Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Offerors, and the total underwriting commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Preferred HITS as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Offerors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact or any such inaccurate or alleged inaccurate representation or warranty relates to information supplied by the Offerors, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6(c), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim. The provisions set forth in Section 6(c) with respect to notice of commencement of any action shall apply if a claim for contribution is to be made under this Section 6(e); , , that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given in accordance with Section 6(c) for purposes of indemnification. The Offerors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6(e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 6(e).
provided
however
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6(e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts received by such Underwriter in connection with the Preferred HITS or Related Securities underwritten by it. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 6(e) are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their
 
names in Schedule A. For purposes of this Section 6(e), each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company and each Trustee of the Trust who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Trust within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company or the Trust. Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (e), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, as contemplated by the preceding paragraph. However, the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (e).
(f) The Company agrees to indemnify the Trust against all losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred by the Trust under Section 6(a) hereof.
SECTION 7. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representative, by notice given to the Offerors prior to delivery of and payment for the Preferred HITS, if prior to such time (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, or (ii) a banking moratorium or a material disruption in the commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities, or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or material escalation of hostilities or other calamity or crisis (in the United States or elsewhere) the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representative, impracticable to market the Preferred HITS.
SECTION 8. DEFAULT BY ONE OR MORE OF THE UNDERWRITERS. If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Time to purchase all or part of the Preferred HITS that it or they are obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), the Representative shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representative shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then:
(a) if the number of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the Preferred HITS each of the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or
(b) if the number of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the Preferred HITS this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter, the Company or the Trust.
 
No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representative or the Offerors shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.
SECTION 9. NOTICES. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
BAC Capital Trust XIV (the "Trust"), a statutory trust organized under the Statutory Trust Act of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Act"), and Bank of America Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company" and, together with the Trust, the "Offerors"), confirm their agreement (the "Agreement") with Banc of America Securities LLC and each of the several Underwriters named in Schedule A hereto (collectively, the "Underwriters," which term also shall include any underwriter substituted as hereinafter provided in Section 8 hereof), for whom Banc of America Securities LLC is acting as the Representative (in such capacity, the "Representative"), with respect to the sale by the Trust and the purchase by the Underwriters, acting severally and not jointly, of the respective numbers of 5.63% Fixed to Floating Rate Preferred Hybrid Income Term Securities (liquidation amount of $1,000 per security) of the Trust (the "Preferred HITS") set forth in Schedule A attached hereto. The Trust is authorized to issue three classes of Hybrid Income Term Securities (the "HITS"): the Preferred HITS, the Treasury HITS and the Corporate HITS. The HITS will be guaranteed on a junior subordinated basis by the Company, to the extent set forth in the Prospectus (as defined herein), with respect to distributions and payments upon liquidation, redemption and otherwise (the "HITS Guarantee") pursuant to the Guarantee Agreement, to be dated as of February 16, 2007 (the "Guarantee Agreement"), by and between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Guarantee Trustee"), and will be entitled to the benefits of certain back-up undertakings described in the Prospectus with respect to the Company's agreement pursuant to the Fourteenth Supplemental Indenture (as defined herein) to pay all reasonable expenses relating to administration of the Trust (other than payment obligations with respect to the HITS). The Company will enter into a Replacement Capital Covenant to be dated as of the Closing Date in favor of and for the benefit of each Covered Debtholder (as defined therein) which may be amended or supplemented from time to time in accordance with the provisions thereof (the "Replacement Capital Covenant").
The Offerors understand that the Underwriters propose to make an offering of the Preferred HITS as soon as the Representative deems advisable after this Agreement has been executed and delivered and the Declaration (as defined herein), the Indenture (as defined herein) and the HITS Guarantee Agreement have been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Trust Indenture Act"). The entire proceeds to the Trust from the sale of the Preferred HITS will be combined with the entire proceeds from the sale by the Trust to the Company of its common securities (the "Common Securities") and will be used by the Trust to purchase $850,100,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Remarketable Fixed Rate Junior Subordinated Notes due 2043 (the "Junior Subordinated Notes") issued by the Company pursuant to the Indenture (as defined herein). The Common Securities will be guaranteed on a junior subordinated basis by the Company, to the extent set forth in the Prospectus, with respect to distributions and payments upon liquidation, redemption, and otherwise (the "Common Securities Guarantee" and, together with the HITS Guarantee, the "Guarantees") pursuant to the Common Securities Guarantee Agreement, to be dated as of February 16, 2007 (the "Common Securities Guarantee Agreement" and, together with the HITS Guarantee Agreement, the "Guarantee Agreements").
The Preferred HITS and the Common Securities will be issued pursuant to the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust of the Trust, dated as of February 16, 2007 (the "Declaration") among the Company, as Sponsor, James T. Houghton, Ann J. Travis, and Richard L. Nichols, Jr., as trustees (the "Regular Trustees"), The Bank of New York (Delaware), a Delaware banking corporation, as Delaware trustee (the "Delaware Trustee"), and The Bank of New York, a New York banking corporation, as property trustee (the "Property Trustee" and, together with the Delaware Trustee and Regular Trustees, the "Trustees"), and the holders from time to time of undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust. The Junior Subordinated Notes will be issued pursuant to a restated indenture, dated as of November 1, 2001 (the "Base Indenture"), by and between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. as successor trustee to The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Debt Trustee"), as supplemented by a fourteenth supplement to the Base Indenture, to be dated as of February 16, 2007 (the "Fourteenth Supplemental Indenture," and together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), by and between the Company and the Debt Trustee. The Trust will contemporaneously enter into (i) a Stock Purchase Contract Agreement (the "Stock Purchase Contract Agreement") with the Company, pursuant to which the Trust will agree to purchase 8,501 Stock Purchase Contracts (each a "Stock Purchase Contract"), each having a stated amount of $100,000 and obligating the Trust to purchase from the Company, and the Company to sell to the Trust, subject to the terms thereof, one share of the Company's Adjustable Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series G, $100,000 liquidation preference per share (the "Preferred Stock"), on the Stock Purchase Date provided for in (and as defined in) the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, and (ii) a Collateral Agreement (the "Collateral Agreement") with The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as collateral agent (the "Collateral Agent'), under which the Trust will initially pledge the Junior Subordinated Notes to secure its obligation to purchase the Preferred Stock under the Stock Purchase Contracts. The Treasury HITS, the Corporate HITS, the Junior Subordinated Notes, the Guarantees, the Stock Purchase Contracts and the Preferred Stock are collectively referred to herein as the "Related Securities".
Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined but that are defined in the Prospectus shall have the meanings specified in the Prospectus.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 6, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure to so notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any liability other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 6 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (other than local counsel approved by the Representatives)), representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action or (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
(d) The indemnifying party under this Section 6 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(e) If the indemnification provided for in Sections 6(a) through (d) is for any reason unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Offerors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Preferred HITS and the Related Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Offerors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Offerors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Preferred HITS and the Related Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Preferred HITS and the Related Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Offerors, and the total underwriting commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Preferred HITS as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Offerors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact or any such inaccurate or alleged inaccurate representation or warranty relates to information supplied by the Offerors, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6(c), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim. The provisions set forth in Section 6(c) with respect to notice of commencement of any action shall apply if a claim for contribution is to be made under this Section 6(e); , , that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given in accordance with Section 6(c) for purposes of indemnification. The Offerors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6(e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 6(e).
provided
however
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6(e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts received by such Underwriter in connection with the Preferred HITS or Related Securities underwritten by it. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 6(e) are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their
 
names in Schedule A. For purposes of this Section 6(e), each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company and each Trustee of the Trust who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Trust within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company or the Trust. Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (e), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, as contemplated by the preceding paragraph. However, the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (e).
(f) The Company agrees to indemnify the Trust against all losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred by the Trust under Section 6(a) hereof.
SECTION 7. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representative, by notice given to the Offerors prior to delivery of and payment for the Preferred HITS, if prior to such time (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, or (ii) a banking moratorium or a material disruption in the commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities, or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or material escalation of hostilities or other calamity or crisis (in the United States or elsewhere) the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representative, impracticable to market the Preferred HITS.
SECTION 8. DEFAULT BY ONE OR MORE OF THE UNDERWRITERS. If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Time to purchase all or part of the Preferred HITS that it or they are obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), the Representative shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representative shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then:
(a) if the number of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the Preferred HITS each of the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or
(b) if the number of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the Preferred HITS this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter, the Company or the Trust.
 
No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representative or the Offerors shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.
SECTION 9. NOTICES. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication.

To the extent that any dividends payable on the shares of Series F Preferred Stock on any Dividend Payment Date are not declared and paid, in full or otherwise, on such Dividend Payment Date, then such unpaid dividends shall not cumulate and shall cease to accrue and be payable and the Corporation shall have no obligation to pay, and the holders of Series F Preferred Stock shall have no right to receive, dividends accrued for such Dividend Period after the Dividend Payment Date for such Dividend Period or interest with respect to such
(b) Non-Cumulative Dividends
 
dividends, whether or not dividends are declared for any subsequent Dividend Period with respect to Series F Preferred Stock, Parity Stock, Junior Stock or any other class or series of authorized preferred stock of the Corporation.
. So long as any share of Series F Preferred Stock remains outstanding, (i) no dividend shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment and no distribution shall be declared or made or set aside for payment on any Junior Stock, other than a dividend payable solely in shares of Junior Stock, (ii) no shares of Junior Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly (other than as a result of a reclassification of Junior Stock for or into other Junior Stock, or the exchange or conversion of one share of Junior Stock for or into another share of Junior Stock, and other than through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Junior Stock), nor shall any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such Junior Stock by the Corporation and (iii) no shares of Parity Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation otherwise than pursuant to offers to purchase all, or a portion, of the Series F Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock except by conversion into or exchange for Junior Stock, in each case unless full dividends on all outstanding shares of Series F Preferred Stock for the then-current Dividend Period have been paid in full or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside.

To the extent the Corporation declares dividends on the Series F Preferred Stock and on any Parity Stock but cannot make full payment of such declared dividends, the Corporation will allocate the dividend payments on a basis among the holders of the shares of Series F Preferred Stock and the holders of any Parity Stock. For purposes of calculating the allocation of partial dividend payments, the Corporation will allocate dividend payments based on the ratio between the then-current dividend payments due on the shares of Series F Preferred Stock and the aggregate of the current and accrued dividends due on the Parity Stock. No interest will be payable in respect of any dividend payment on shares of Series F Preferred Stock that may be in arrears. Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, such dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation may be declared and paid on any Junior Stock from time to time out of any assets legally available therefor, and the shares of Series F Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend.

. If the liquidation preference plus any dividends which have been declared but not yet paid has been paid in full to all holders of Series F Preferred Stock and all holders of any Parity Stock, then the holders of Junior Stock shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation according to their respective rights and preferences.
(c) Residual Distributions
. For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Corporation into or with any other corporation or person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or person into or with the Corporation be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.

To the extent that any dividends payable on the shares of Series G Preferred Stock on any Dividend Payment Date are not declared and paid, in full or otherwise, on such Dividend Payment Date, then such unpaid dividends shall not cumulate and shall cease to accrue and be payable and the Corporation shall have no obligation to pay, and the holders of
(b) Non-Cumulative Dividends
 
Series G Preferred Stock shall have no right to receive, dividends accrued for such Dividend Period after the Dividend Payment Date for such Dividend Period or interest with respect to such dividends, whether or not dividends are declared for any subsequent Dividend Period with respect to Series G Preferred Stock, Parity Stock, Junior Stock or any other class or series of authorized preferred stock of the Corporation.
. So long as any share of Series G Preferred Stock remains outstanding, (i) no dividend shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment and no distribution shall be declared or made or set aside for payment on any Junior Stock, other than a dividend payable solely in shares of Junior Stock, (ii) no shares of Junior Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly (other than as a result of a reclassification of Junior Stock for or into other Junior Stock, or the exchange or conversion of one share of Junior Stock for or into another share of Junior Stock, and other than through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Junior Stock), nor shall any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such Junior Stock by the Corporation and (iii) no shares of Parity Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation otherwise than pursuant to offers to purchase all, or a portion, of the Series G Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock except by conversion into or exchange for Junior Stock, in each case unless full dividends on all outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock for the then-current Dividend Period have been paid in full or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside.

Subject to the succeeding sentence, for so long as any shares of Series G Preferred Stock remain outstanding, no dividends shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment on any Parity Stock for any period unless full dividends on all outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock for the then-current Dividend Period have been paid in full or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside. To the extent the Corporation declares dividends on the Series G Preferred Stock and on any Parity Stock but cannot make full payment of such declared dividends, the Corporation will allocate the dividend payments on a basis among the holders of the shares of Series G Preferred Stock and the holders of any Parity Stock. For purposes of calculating the allocation of partial dividend payments, the Corporation will allocate dividend payments based on the ratio between the then-current dividend payments due on the shares of Series G Preferred Stock and the aggregate of the current and accrued dividends due on the Parity Stock. No interest will be payable in respect of any dividend payment on shares of Series G Preferred Stock that may be in arrears. Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, such dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation may be declared and paid on any Junior Stock from time to time out of any assets legally available therefor, and the shares of Series G Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend.

(b) Partial Payment
pro rata
. If the liquidation preference plus any dividends which have been declared but not yet paid has been paid in full to all holders of Series G Preferred Stock and all holders of any Parity Stock, then the holders of Junior Stock shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation according to their respective rights and preferences.
(c) Residual Distributions
. For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Corporation into or with any other corporation or person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or person into or with the Corporation be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.

CALCULATION AGENT: The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.
BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (herein called the "Corporation," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum of FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ($500,000,000) on February 12, 2010 (except to the extent redeemed or repaid prior to that date). The Corporation will pay interest on such principal amount for each quarterly interest period from the Original Issue Date through August 17, 2008 at a floating rate equal to Three-Month LIBOR (as defined below) plus the Spread of 0.01%. The Corporation will pay interest on such principal amount for each quarterly interest period from August 18, 2008 to the Maturity Date or earlier redemption date at a floating rate equal to Three-Month LIBOR plus the Spread of 0.12%. Interest shall be payable commencing on the first Interest Payment Date succeeding the Original Issue Date and
on each Interest Payment Date thereafter and on the Maturity Date. If the Corporation shall default in the payment of interest due on an Interest Payment Date, then this Note shall bear interest from the next preceding Interest Payment Date for which interest has been paid, or, if no interest has been paid on the Notes, from the Original Issue Date.
Interest on this Note will accrue from the Original Issue Date until the principal amount is paid or duly provided for and will be computed as described in this Note. Interest payable on this Note on any Interest Payment Date or on the Maturity Date will include interest accrued from, and including, the preceding Interest Payment Date for which interest has been paid or duly provided for (or from, and including, the Original Issue Date if no interest has been paid or duly provided for, as the case may be) to, but excluding, such Interest Payment Date or Maturity Date, as the case may be. If any Interest Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day (as defined below), such Interest Payment Date shall be the following day that is a Business Day (and no interest will accrue as a result of that postponement), except if such next Business Day falls in the next calendar month, such Interest Payment Date will be the preceding day that is a Business Day; and if the Maturity Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, principal or interest payable with respect to such Maturity Date will be paid on the next Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Maturity Date, and no additional interest shall accrue for the period from and after such Maturity Date. Interest will be calculated using the actual number of days in an interest period and a 360-day year.
An interest period is the period beginning on the Original Issue Date or an Interest Payment Date and ending on the date immediately preceding the next following Interest Payment Date or Maturity Date, as the case may be. The interest rate on this Note in effect for each interest period will be determined by the Calculation Agent using Three-Month LIBOR on the Interest Determination Date for that interest period. The Calculation Agent will add Three-Month LIBOR as determined on the Interest Determination Date to the applicable Spread to calculate the interest rate in effect for the applicable interest period.
"Three-Month LIBOR" means the London interbank offered rate for deposits of at least $1,000,000 in U.S. dollars having an index maturity of three months, as that rate appears on Telerate page 3750 at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on the Interest Determination Date. A "London banking day" is any day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
If no offered rate appears on Telerate page 3750 on an Interest Determination Date at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, then the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Corporation) will select four major banks in the London interbank market and will request each of their principal London offices to provide a quotation of the rate at which three-month deposits in U.S. dollars in amounts of at least $1,000,000 are offered by it to prime banks in the London interbank market, on that date and at that time, that is representative of single transactions at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, Three-Month LIBOR will be the arithmetic average of the quotations provided.

Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

(b) Mandatory redemption of Corporate HITS. On the maturity of the Notes or each Note Redemption Date, the Trust will be required to redeem a Like Amount of Corporate HITS at the Note Redemption Price (it being understood and agreed that, because (i) the Notes by their terms, except in the case of a Special Event, are not redeemable prior to March 15, 2017, (ii) the Trust is required to redeem the Corporate HITS in kind after the Stock Purchase Date pursuant to Section 4.2(c) if there is a Successful Remarketing, and (iii) the Sponsor has the right to cause the Trust to redeem the Corporate HITS in kind after the Stock Purchase Date pursuant to Section 4.2(c) if there is a Failed Remarketing or if the Stock Purchase Contracts terminate, a redemption of Corporate HITS other than in kind pursuant to such Section 4.2(c) will only occur after March 15, 2017 and only if there is a Failed Remarketing and the Sponsor does not exercise its right to cause the Trust to redeem the Corporate HITS in kind).
(c) Redemption in connection with a Remarketing. If a Successful Remarketing occurs, then promptly after the Remarketing Settlement Date the Trust shall redeem the Corporate HITS, in whole but not in part, in kind by exchanging for each Corporate HITS a Like Amount of Notes. If a Failed Remarketing occurs but on the Stock Purchase Date there is no Deferred Note Interest Amount outstanding, then promptly after the Stock Purchase Date the Trust shall redeem the Corporate HITS, in whole but not in part, in kind by exchanging for each Corporate HITS a Like Amount of Notes. If a Failed Remarketing occurs and there is a Deferred Note Interest Amount outstanding on the Stock Purchase Date, or if the Stock Purchase Contracts terminate in accordance with the terms of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement prior to a Stock Purchase Date occurring, then the Sponsor may instruct the Trust at any time thereafter when no Deferred Note Interest Amount is outstanding to redeem the Corporate HITS, in whole but not in part, in kind by exchanging for each Corporate HITS a Like Amount of Notes. Any such redemption will be effected by Book-Entry Transfer of Notes in global form if the Notes then settle and clear through the Clearing Agency, and if the Notes do not then settle and clear through the Clearing Agency by delivery of definitive certificates evidencing the Notes to the Holders of Corporate HITS.
(d) Redemption in Connection with a Special Event. At any time within 90 days after a Tax Event, Capital Treatment Event or an Investment Company Event, the Corporation shall have the right to redeem, in whole but not in part, the Notes at the Note Redemption Price and all HITS will be redeemed pro rata based upon their respective Corresponding Assets.

Section 6.6
Proxies, Etc.
At any meeting of Holders, any Holder entitled to vote thereat may vote by proxy, that no proxy shall be voted at any meeting unless it shall have been placed on file with the Property Trustee, or with such other officer or agent of the Trust as the Property Trustee may direct, for verification prior to the time at which such vote shall be taken. Pursuant to a resolution of the Property Trustee, proxies may be solicited in the name of the Property Trustee or one or more officers of the Property Trustee. Only Holders of record shall be entitled to vote. When Trust Securities are held jointly by several Persons, any one of them may vote at any meeting in person or by proxy in respect of such Trust Securities, but if more

A proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a Holder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise, and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger. No proxy shall be valid more than three years after its date of execution.
Section 6.7
Holder Action by Written Consent.
Any action that may be taken by Holders at a meeting may be taken without a meeting and without prior notice if Holders holding at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of all HITS entitled to vote in respect of such action (or such larger proportion thereof as shall be required by any other provision of this Declaration) shall consent to the action in writing.
Section 6.8
Record Date for Voting and Other Purposes.
For the purposes of determining the Holders who are entitled to notice of and to vote at any meeting or by written consent, or to participate in any distribution on the Trust Securities in respect of which a record date is not otherwise provided for in this Declaration, or for the purpose of any other action, the Regular Trustees may from time to time fix a date, not more than 90 days prior to the date of any meeting of Holders or the payment of a Distribution or other action, as the case may be, as a record date for the determination of the identity of the Holders of record for such purposes. The Regular Trustees shall cause a notice of any such date fixed in respect of any such distribution to be forwarded to each Paying Agent.
Section 6.9
Acts of Holders.
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Declaration to be given, made or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Property Trustee and the Regular Trustees. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Declaration and (subject to Section 8.1) conclusive in favor of the Trustees, if made in the manner provided in this Section.
Act
The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner that any Trustee receiving the same deems sufficient.
The ownership of Trust Securities shall be proved by the Securities Register.
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Trust Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Trust Security and the Holder of every Trust Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustees, or the Trust in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Trust Security.

The Sponsor hereby represents and warrants for the benefit of the Holders that:

powers, if it or they shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Declaration relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustees shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 8.1. To the extent that, at law or in equity, a Trustee has duties and liabilities relating to the Trust or to the Holders, such Trustee shall not be liable to the Trust or to any Holder for such Trustee's good faith reliance on the provisions of this Declaration. Except as otherwise required by the Trust Indenture Act and the Commission's rules thereunder applicable to indentures qualified under such Act, the provisions of this Declaration, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of the Trustees otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Sponsor and the Holders to replace such other duties and liabilities of the Trustees.

Each Holder, by its acceptance of a Trust Security, agrees that it will look solely to the revenue and proceeds from the Trust Property to the extent legally available for distribution to it as herein provided and that the Trustees are not personally liable to such Holder for any amount distributable in respect of any Trust Security or for any other liability in respect of any Trust Security.

(c) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Property Trustee shall enforce this Declaration and the Transaction Agreements for the benefit of the Holders.
(d) The Property Trustee, before the occurrence of any Event of Default and after the curing of all Events of Default that may have occurred, shall undertake to perform only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Declaration (including pursuant to Section 12.10), and no implied covenants shall be read into this Declaration against the Property Trustee. If an Event of Default has occurred (that has not been cured or waived pursuant to Section 5.07 of the Base Indenture), the Property Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Declaration, and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise thereof, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.
(e) No provision of this Declaration shall be construed to relieve the Property Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:
(i) prior to the occurrence of any Event of Default and after the curing or waiving of all such Events of Default that may have occurred:
(A) the duties and obligations of the Property Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Declaration (including pursuant to Section 12.10), and the Property Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Declaration (including pursuant to Section 12.10); and
(B) in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Property Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Declaration; but in the case of any such certificates or

(iv) the Property Trustee's sole duty with respect to the custody, safekeeping and physical preservation of the Notes, the Stock Purchase Contracts, the Preferred Stock and the Payment Account shall be to deal with such property in a similar manner as the Property Trustee deals with similar property for its own account, subject to the protections and limitations on liability afforded to the Property Trustee under this Declaration and the Trust Indenture Act;
(v) the Property Trustee shall not be liable for any interest on any money received by it except as it may otherwise agree with the Sponsor; and money held by the Property Trustee need not be segregated from other funds held by it except in relation to the Payment Account maintained by the Property Trustee pursuant to Section 3.1 and except to the extent otherwise required by law;
(vi) the Property Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the Regular Trustees, the Sponsor, the Collateral Agent, the Securities Registrar, the Custodial Agent, the Paying Agent, the Remarketing Agent or any other Person, with their respective duties under this Declaration or any Transaction Document, nor shall the Property Trustee be liable for the default or misconduct of any other Trustee, the Regular Trustees, the Sponsor, the Collateral Agent, the Securities Registrar, the Custodial Agent, the Paying Agent, the Remarketing Agent or any other Person; and
(vii) subject to Section 8.1(c), no provision of this Declaration shall require the Property Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if the Property Trustee shall have reasonable grounds for believing that the repayment of such funds or liability is not reasonably assured to it under the terms of this Declaration or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
(f) The Regular Trustees shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the other Trustees or the Sponsor with their respective duties under this Declaration, nor shall any Regular Trustee be liable for the default or misconduct of any other Trustee or the Sponsor.

Unless and until a Note Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, at any time or times, for the purpose of meeting the legal requirements of the Trust Indenture Act or of any jurisdiction in which any part of the Trust Property may at the time be located, the Holder of Common Securities and the Regular Trustees shall have the power to appoint one or more Persons either to act as co-trustee, jointly with the Property Trustee, of all or any part of such Trust Property, or to the extent required by law to act as separate trustee of any such property, in either case with such powers as may be provided in the instrument of appointment, and to vest in such Person or Persons in the capacity aforesaid, any property, title, right or power deemed necessary or desirable, subject to the other provisions of this Section. If a Note Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Property Trustee shall have the sole power to so appoint such a co-trustee or separate trustee, and upon the written request of the Property Trustee, the Sponsor, and the Regular Trustees shall for such purpose join with the Property Trustee in the execution, delivery, and performance of all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to appoint, such co-trustee or separate trustee.

(b) The rights, powers, duties, and obligations hereby conferred or imposed upon the Property Trustee in respect of any property covered by such appointment shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed by the Property Trustee or by the Property Trustee and such co-trustee or separate trustee jointly, as shall be provided in the instrument appointing such co-trustee or separate trustee, except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act is to be performed, the Property Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act, in which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations shall be exercised and performed by such co-trustee or separate trustee.

(ii) the Distributions payable on each Regular Distribution Date for the related Distribution Period will be at a rate per annum applied to the Liquidation Amount per Preferred HITS and Common Security equal to the Preferred HITS Distribution Rate for such Distribution Period (with the consequence that the amount of the Distribution for each $1,000 of Preferred HITS or Common Securities payable on each Regular Distribution Date being equal to (x) the sum of the amount of interest payable on such Regular Distribution Date on a Like Amount of Notes (without giving effect to any change in the interest rate on the Notes in connection with a Remarketing) plus 1/100th of the Contract Payment payable on a Stock Purchase Contract having a stated amount of $100,000 for each Distribution Period ending on or before the Stock Purchase Date and (y) the amount of dividends payable on such Regular Distribution Date on a Like Amount of Preferred Stock for each Distribution Period thereafter; and

(iv) additionally, on each Additional Distribution Date on which Treasury HITS are Outstanding (or as promptly thereafter as the Collateral Agent and the Paying Agent determine to be practicable), the Property Trustee shall distribute or cause to be distributed through the Paying Agent an amount per $1,000 of Treasury HITS equal to, the Treasury HITS Treasury Roll-Over Amount for such Additional Distribution Date.
(e) Distributions on the Trust Securities of a Class shall be made by the Paying Agent from the Payment Account and shall be payable on each Distribution Date only to the extent that the Trust has funds then on hand and available in the Payment Account from the Corresponding Assets of such Class for the payment of such Distributions. The Trust will have amounts to make full Distributions on the relevant Classes of Trust Securities in accordance with Sections 4.1(b), (c) and (d) on an applicable Distribution Date only if the Corporation has not (i) defaulted in paying interest on the Notes or Contract Payments on the Stock Purchase Contracts or (ii) exercised its right to defer payment of interest on the Notes and Contract Payments on the Stock Purchase Contracts and, accordingly, there is no outstanding Deferred Note Interest Amount or Deferred Contract Payment Amount.

Redemption.
(a) Mandatory redemption of Preferred HITS upon redemption of Preferred Stock. On each Preferred Stock Redemption Date, the Trust will be required to redeem a Like Amount of Preferred HITS and Common Securities at the redemption price for the Preferred Stock (it being understood and agreed that, because (i) the Preferred Stock will not become Trust Property until the Stock Purchase Date, and (ii) on the Stock Purchase Date, subject to Section 4.8, each $1,000 Liquidation Amount of Treasury HITS will automatically become $1,000 Liquidation Amount of Preferred HITS (and if any subordinated notes have been issued in respect of any Deferred Note Interest Amounts such subordinated notes will be distributed to the holders of the Preferred HITS), unless there is a Note Redemption Date resulting from a Special Event, without any action by or on behalf of Holders being necessary, no redemption of Preferred HITS, Treasury HITS or Common Securities will occur prior to the Stock Purchase Date).
(b) Mandatory redemption of Corporate HITS. On the maturity of the Notes or each Note Redemption Date, the Trust will be required to redeem a Like Amount of Corporate HITS at the Note Redemption Price (it being understood and agreed that, because (i) the Notes by their terms, except in the case of a Special Event, are not redeemable prior to March 15, 2017, (ii) the Trust is required to redeem the Corporate HITS in kind after the Stock Purchase Date pursuant to Section 4.2(c) if there is a Successful Remarketing, and (iii) the Sponsor has the right to cause the Trust to redeem the Corporate HITS in kind after the Stock Purchase Date pursuant to Section 4.2 if there is a Failed Remarketing or if the Stock Purchase Contracts terminate, a redemption of Corporate HITS other than in kind pursuant to such Section 4.2(c) will only occur after March 15, 2017 and only if there is a Failed Remarketing and the Sponsor does not exercise its right to cause the Trust to redeem the Corporate HITS in kind).
(c) Redemption in connection with a Remarketing. If a Successful Remarketing occurs, then promptly after the Remarketing Settlement Date the Trust shall redeem the Corporate HITS, in whole but not in part, in kind by exchanging for each Corporate HITS a Like Amount of Notes. If a Failed Remarketing occurs but on the Stock Purchase Date there is no Deferred Note Interest Amount outstanding, then promptly after the Stock Purchase Date the Trust shall redeem the Corporate HITS, in whole but not in part, in kind by exchanging for each Corporate HITS a Like Amount of Notes. If a Failed Remarketing occurs and there is a Deferred Note Interest Amount outstanding on the Stock Purchase Date, or if the Stock Purchase Contracts terminate in accordance with the terms of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement prior to a Stock Purchase Date occurring, then the Sponsor may instruct the Trust at any time thereafter when no Deferred Note Interest Amount is outstanding to redeem the Corporate HITS, in whole but not in part, in kind by exchanging for each Corporate HITS a Like Amount of Notes. Any such redemption will be effected by Book-Entry Transfer of Notes in global form if the Notes then settle and clear through the Clearing Agency, and if the Notes do not then settle and clear through the Clearing Agency by delivery of definitive certificates evidencing the Notes to the Holders of Corporate HITS.
(d) Redemption in Connection with a Special Event. At any time within 90 days after a Tax Event, Capital Treatment Event or an Investment Company Event, the Corporation shall have the right to redeem, in whole but not in part, the Notes at the Note Redemption Price and all HITS will be redeemed pro rata based upon their respective Corresponding Assets.
(e) Notice of redemption. Notice of redemption shall be given by the Property Trustee by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 15 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date to each Holder of Trust Securities to be redeemed, at such Holder's address appearing in the Security Register.

Redemptions of the Trust Securities shall be made and the Redemption Price shall be payable on each Redemption Date only to the extent that the Trust has funds then on hand and available in the Payment Account from the Corporation's redemption of Preferred Stock or Notes, as applicable, for the payment of such Redemption Price.

The ownership of Trust Securities shall be proved by the Securities Register.
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Trust Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Trust Security and the Holder of every Trust Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustees, or the Trust in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Trust Security.

powers, if it or they shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Declaration relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustees shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 8.1. To the extent that, at law or in equity, a Trustee has duties and liabilities relating to the Trust or to the Holders, such Trustee shall not be liable to the Trust or to any Holder for such Trustee's good faith reliance on the provisions of this Declaration. Except as otherwise required by the Trust Indenture Act and the Commission's rules thereunder applicable to indentures qualified under such Act, the provisions of this Declaration, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of the Trustees otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Sponsor and the Holders to replace such other duties and liabilities of the Trustees.

(d) The Property Trustee, before the occurrence of any Event of Default and after the curing of all Events of Default that may have occurred, shall undertake to perform only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Declaration (including pursuant to Section 12.10), and no implied covenants shall be read into this Declaration against the Property Trustee. If an Event of Default has occurred (that has not been cured or waived pursuant to Section 5.07 of the Base Indenture), the Property Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Declaration, and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise thereof, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.

(i) prior to the occurrence of any Event of Default and after the curing or waiving of all such Events of Default that may have occurred:
(A) the duties and obligations of the Property Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Declaration (including pursuant to Section 12.10), and the Property Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Declaration (including pursuant to Section 12.10); and
(B) in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Property Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Declaration; but in the case of any such certificates or

(iv) the Property Trustee's sole duty with respect to the custody, safekeeping and physical preservation of the Notes, the Stock Purchase Contracts, the Preferred Stock and the Payment Account shall be to deal with such property in a similar manner as the Property Trustee deals with similar property for its own account, subject to the protections and limitations on liability afforded to the Property Trustee under this Declaration and the Trust Indenture Act;
(v) the Property Trustee shall not be liable for any interest on any money received by it except as it may otherwise agree with the Sponsor; and money held by the Property Trustee need not be segregated from other funds held by it except in relation to the Payment Account maintained by the Property Trustee pursuant to Section 3.1 and except to the extent otherwise required by law;
(vi) the Property Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the Regular Trustees, the Sponsor, the Collateral Agent, the Securities Registrar, the Custodial Agent, the Paying Agent, the Remarketing Agent or any other Person, with their respective duties under this Declaration or any Transaction Document, nor shall the Property Trustee be liable for the default or misconduct of any other Trustee, the Regular Trustees, the Sponsor, the Collateral Agent, the Securities Registrar, the Custodial Agent, the Paying Agent, the Remarketing Agent or any other Person; and
(vii) subject to Section 8.1(c), no provision of this Declaration shall require the Property Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if the Property Trustee shall have reasonable grounds for believing that the repayment of such funds or liability is not reasonably assured to it under the terms of this Declaration or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
(f) The Regular Trustees shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the other Trustees or the Sponsor with their respective duties under this Declaration, nor shall any Regular Trustee be liable for the default or misconduct of any other Trustee or the Sponsor.

If an Early Dissolution Event specified in clause (c) of Section 9.2 occurs, because such Early Dissolution Event is also an Early Settlement Event, unless otherwise required by applicable law the Trust will not be liquidated until after the Stock Purchase Date but, commencing promptly after the Stock Purchase Date, the Trust shall be liquidated by the Property Trustee and the Regular Trustees as expeditiously as the Property Trustee and the Regular Trustees determine to be possible by distributing, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust as provided by applicable law, to each Holder of HITS of each Class a Like Amount of Corresponding Assets as of the date of such distribution, subject to Section 9.4(d).

(iv) provide such information with respect to the mechanics by which Holders may exchange Trust Securities Certificates of such Class for Corresponding Assets, or if Section 9.4(d) applies, receive a Liquidation Distribution, as the Property Trustee (after consultation with the Regular Trustees) shall deem appropriate.
(b) Except where Section 9.2(e) or 9.4(d) applies, in order to effect the liquidation of the Trust and distribution of the Corresponding Assets to Holders, the Property Trustee, either itself acting as exchange agent or through the appointment of a separate exchange agent, shall establish a record date for such distribution (which shall be not more than 30 days prior to the Liquidation Date) and, establish such procedures as it shall deem appropriate to effect the distribution of Corresponding Assets in exchange for the Outstanding Trust Securities Certificates of the related Classes.

In case of any such merger, consolidation, share exchange, sale, assignment, transfer, lease or conveyance and upon any such assumption by a successor corporation in accordance with Section 4.1, such successor entity shall succeed to and be substituted for the Company with the same effect as if it had been named herein as the Company.

(i) The Property Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself to be a holder of Senior Obligations (or a trustee or representative on behalf of such holder) to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of Senior Obligations or a trustee or representative on behalf of any such holder or holders. In the event that the Property Trustee determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Obligations to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to Section 2.6(b) through (l), the Property Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Property Trustee as to the amount of Senior Obligations held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under Sections 2.6(b) through (l), and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Property Trustee may defer payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment.

(m) Nothing in this Section 2.6 shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Property Trustee under or pursuant to Section 2.7.
(n) With respect to the holders of Senior Obligations, (i) the duties and obligations of the Property Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement; (ii) the Property Trustee shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall, acting in good faith, mistakenly pay over or distribute to the Holders or to the Company or any other Person cash, securities or other property to which any holders of Senior Obligations shall be entitled by virtue of this Section 2.6 or otherwise; (iii) no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Property Trustee; and (iv) the Property Trustee shall not be deemed to be a fiduciary as to such holders.

provided
 
(d) In the event the Company exercises its option to defer the payment of Contract Payments then, until the earlier of (x) the Termination Date or (y) the date on which the Company shall have either paid all Deferred Contract Payments to the Property Trustee in cash or repaid all amounts outstanding on the Subordinated Notes, the Company shall not (i) declare or pay any dividend on, make any distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock or make any guarantee payment with respect thereto, other than:

Up to and including the Stock Purchase Date, or the earlier termination of the Stock Purchase Contracts, any Holder shall have the right, upon default in the payment of any Contract Payment with respect to any Stock Purchase Contract on the respective Payment Date (subject to Article II), to institute a suit directly against the Company for enforcement of payment to such Holder of Contract Payments on Stock Purchase Contracts (or interests therein) having a stated amount equal to the aggregate Liquidation Amount (as defined

Guarantee Trustee, the Guarantee Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this HITS Guarantee Agreement);

(iv) The Guarantee Trustee may consult with legal counsel, and the advice or opinion of such legal counsel with respect to legal matters shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted to be

(vi) The Guarantee Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document, but the Guarantee Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit at the expense of the Guarantor and shall incur no liability of any kind by reason of such inquiry or investigation.

No permissive power or authority available to the Guarantee Trustee shall be construed to be a duty to act in accordance with such power and authority. The Guarantee Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered, or omitted to be taken by it in good faith and reasonably believed by it to be authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this HITS Guarantee Agreement.

corporation meeting the requirements of Section 310(a) of the Trust Indenture Act. If such corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of its supervising or examining authority, then, for the purposes of this Section 4.1(a) and to the extent permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published.

As such counsel, we have examined and are familiar with such original or photocopies or certified copies of such records of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, certificates of officers of the Corporation and of public officials and such other documents as we have deemed relevant or necessary as the basis for the opinion set forth below.

On the date hereof, the Trust is entering into (i) a Stock Purchase Contract Agreement (the "Stock Purchase Contract Agreement") with the Corporation, pursuant to which the Trust will be obligated to purchase from the Corporation, and the Corporation will be obligated to sell to the Trust, subject to the terms thereof, the Corporation's Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock Series F, no par value and $100,000 liquidation preference per share (the "Preferred Stock").

As such counsel, we have examined and are familiar with such originals or photocopies or certified copies of such records of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, along with certificates
of officers of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, of Regular Trustees of the Trust and of public officials, Forms T-1 supplied by the Debt Trustee and such other documents as we have deemed relevant or necessary as the basis for the opinions set forth below.

Based solely upon the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, and subject to the limitations, qualifications and exceptions set forth below, we are of the opinion that:
1. When (i) executed, issued and delivered by the Corporation to the Trustee for authentication in accordance with the Indenture, (ii) authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, in accordance with the Indenture, and (iii) paid for, all as contemplated in the Board Resolution or Company Order (as each is defined in the Indenture), the Notes will have been validly authorized and issued under the Indenture and will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Corporation, subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors now or hereafter in effect, and to equitable principles that may limit the right to specific performance of remedies, and further subject to 12 U.S.C. 1818(b)(6)(D) (or any successor statute) and any bank regulatory powers now or hereafter in effect and to the application of principles of public policy (the "Permitted Exceptions").
2. The HITS Guarantee has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Corporation and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Corporation, enforceable against the Corporation in accordance with its terms, subject to the Permitted Exceptions.
3. The Preferred Stock has been duly authorized and, when duly issued as contemplated by the Prospectus, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
 
We hereby consent to be named in the Registration Statement as attorneys who passed upon the legality of the Notes and to the filing of a copy of this opinion as part of the Corporation's Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed for the purpose of including this opinion as part of the Registration Statement.

We also have acted as counsel to the Corporation and the Trust in connection with the preparation of the Underwriting Agreement dated February 12, 2007 (the "Underwriting Agreement") among the Corporation, the Trust, and the underwriters named in Schedule A thereto (the "Underwriters"). On the date hereof, the Trust is entering into (i) a Stock Purchase Contract Agreement (the "Stock Purchase Contract Agreement") with the Corporation, pursuant to which the Trust will be obligated to purchase from the Corporation, and the Corporation will be obligated to sell to the Trust, subject to the terms thereof, the Corporation's Adjustable Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock Series G, no par value and $100,000 liquidation preference per share (the "Preferred Stock").

In addition, with your permission, we have expressly assumed (i) the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust dated as of February 16, 2007 between the Corporation, as Sponsor, The Bank of New York, as Property Trustee, The Bank of New York (Delaware), as Delaware Trustee, and the Regular Trustees named therein (the "Declaration"); the Restated Indenture dated as of November 1, 2001 (the "Base Indenture") between the Corporation and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee to The Bank of New York (the "Trustee"); the Fourteenth Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 16, 2007 (the "Fourteenth Supplemental Indenture," and collectively with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture") between the Corporation and the Trustee; the HITS Guarantee dated as of February 16, 2007 between the Corporation and The Bank of New York, as Guarantee Trustee (the "HITS Guarantee"); the Collateral Agreement dated as of February 16, 2007 (the "Collateral Agreement") between the Corporation and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as Collateral Agent; and the Underwriting Agreement by all parties other than the Corporation, the Regular Trustees or the Trust, and (ii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties contained in the Declaration, the Indenture, the Fourteenth Supplemental Indenture, the HITS Guarantee, the Collateral Agreement and the Underwriting Agreement.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special tax counsel to each of Bank of America Corporation (the "Corporation"), a Delaware corporation, and BAC Capital Trust XIII, a statutory trust organized under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act (the "Trust"), in connection with the issuance of Floating Rate Preferred Hybrid Income Term Securities (the "Preferred HITS") by the Trust, as described in that certain Prospectus Supplement, dated February 12, 2007 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), to the Prospectus, dated May 5, 2006 (the "Prospectus"), which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the Corporation and the Trust. The Trust is authorized to issue three classes of Hybrid Income Term Securities (the "HITS"): the Preferred HITS, the Treasury HITS and the Corporate HITS (the "HITS"). The Corporation will issue remarketable floating rate junior subordinated notes ("Remarketable Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Notes") which will be purchased by the Trust, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of the Preferred HITS and the Common Securities issued by the Trust. All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the respective meanings assigned to them in the Underwriting Agreement, dated February 12, 2007, by and among the Corporation, the Trust and Banc of America Securities LLC, as the representative of the several underwriters named therein.
In furnishing this opinion, we have examined copies of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus Supplement, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, organizational documents and Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Corporation, the Declaration of the Trust, as amended to date, and the minutes of the meeting of the Board of Directors of the Corporation authorizing the issuance of the Remarketable Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Notes, and relied upon the accuracy of the facts, representations, and other matters and the fulfillment of the covenants and obligations set forth therein. We also have examined such other documents, papers, statutes and authorities as we deemed necessary to form a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. In our examination of such
February 16, 2007
material, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as original documents and the conformity to original documents of all documents supplied to us as copies. As to various questions of fact material to such opinion, we have relied upon statements and certificates of officers and representatives of the Corporation and others.
To the extent that the obligations of the Corporation as obligor under the Indenture may be dependent upon such matters, we have assumed for purposes of this opinion (i) that the Debt Trustee is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and is duly qualified to engage in the activities contemplated by the Indenture, (ii) that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Debt Trustee, enforceable in accordance with its terms, (iii) that the Debt Trustee is in compliance, generally and with respect to acting as a Debt Trustee under the Indenture, with all applicable laws and regulations, and (iv) that the Debt Trustee has the requisite organizational and legal power and authority to perform its obligations under the Indenture.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that the statements made in the Prospectus Supplement, under the caption "Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences," to the extent such statements summarize material federal tax consequences of the purchase, beneficial ownership and disposition of the HITS to the holders thereof described therein, are correct in all material respects.
The opinion expressed above is based on existing provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), existing Treasury Regulations thereunder, published interpretations of the Code and such Regulations by the Internal Revenue Service, and existing court decisions, any of which could be changed at any time. Any such changes may or may not be retroactively applied. It is possible that contrary positions may be taken by the Internal Revenue Service and that a court may agree with such contrary positions. In addition, the opinion rendered herein is based on the facts as of the date of this letter, and we disclaim any undertaking to advise you as to any change in fact or law occurring after the delivery of this letter that could affect the opinion rendered herein. Any variation or difference in any fact from those relied on or assumed herein may affect the conclusions stated herein.
We hereby consent to the filing of this letter as an exhibit to the Registration Statement without admitting that we are "experts" within the meaning of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission issued thereunder with respect to any part of the Registration Statement, including this exhibit.

Exhibit 99.1
Replacement Capital Covenant, dated as of February 16, 2007 (this "Replacement Capital Covenant"), by Bank of America Corporation, a Delaware corporation (together with its successors and assigns, the "Corporation"), in favor of and for the benefit of each Covered Debtholder (as defined below).
A.    On the date hereof, BAC Capital Trust XIII, a Delaware statutory trust (the "Trust") having the Corporation as its grantor, is issuing 700,000 of its "Floating Rate Preferred Hybrid Income Term Securities", or "Preferred HITS", having a stated amount of $1,000 per Preferred HITS and $700,000,000 in the aggregate. Each Preferred HITS corresponds to (1) $1,000 principal amount of "Remarketable Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Notes due 2043", or "Junior Subordinated Notes" issued pursuant to the thirteenth supplemental indenture between the Corporation and the trustee named therein (the "Supplemental Indenture"), owned by the Trust and (2) a 1/100th interest in a "Stock Purchase Contract" pursuant to which the Trust is obligated to purchase, and the Corporation is obligated to sell, on the "Stock Purchase Date" determined pursuant to the Stock Purchase Contract, one share of the Corporation's Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series F, $100,000 liquidation preference per share (the "Preferred Stock"; the shares of Preferred Stock covered by all of the Stock Purchase Contracts owned by the Trust, collectively, the "Shares" and, together with the Preferred HITS, the "Treasury HITS" and the "Corporate HITS", each as defined in the Prospectus Supplement referred to in Recital B, the "Securities").
B.    This Replacement Capital Covenant is the "Replacement Capital Covenant" referred to in the Prospectus Supplement, dated February 12, 2007 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), relating to, among other securities, the Securities.

D.    The Corporation acknowledges that reliance by each Covered Debtholder upon the covenants in this Replacement Capital Covenant is reasonable and foreseeable by the Corporation and that, were the Corporation to disregard its covenants in this Replacement Capital Covenant, each Covered Debtholder would have sustained an injury as a result of its reliance on such covenants.
NOW, THEREFORE, the Corporation hereby covenants and agrees as follows in favor of and for the benefit of each Covered Debtholder.
SECTION 1. . Capitalized terms used in this Replacement Capital Covenant (including in the Recitals) have the meanings set forth in Schedule I hereto.

(iv) 100% of the aggregate amount of the net cash proceeds the Corporation and its Subsidiaries have received within a Measurement Period (without double counting proceeds received in any prior Measurement Period) from the sale of Qualifying Capital Securities to Persons other than the Corporation and its Subsidiaries;

Other than the Covered Debtholders as provided in the previous sentence, no other Person shall have any rights under this Replacement Capital Covenant or be deemed a third-party beneficiary of this Replacement Capital Covenant. In particular, no holder of the Junior Subordinated Notes is a third-party beneficiary of this Replacement Capital Covenant, it being understood that such holders may have rights under the Supplemental Indenture.

Alternative Payment Mechanism
(a) define "eligible proceeds" to mean, for purposes of such Alternative Payment Mechanism, the net proceeds (after underwriters' or placement agents' fees, commissions or discounts and other expenses relating to the issuance or sale of the relevant securities, where applicable, and including the fair market value of property received by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries as consideration for such securities) that the Corporation has received during the 180 days prior to the related Distribution Date from the issuance of APM Qualifying Securities, up to the Preferred Cap (as defined in paragraph (f) below) in the case of APM Qualifying Securities that are Qualifying Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock;

(d) notwithstanding clause (b) of this definition, if the Federal Reserve disapproves of the Corporation's or its Subsidiaries' sale of APM Qualifying Securities, may (if the Corporation elects to so provide in the term of such securities) permit the Corporation to pay deferred Distributions from any source without a breach of its obligations under the transaction documents;
(e) if the Federal Reserve does not disapprove the Corporation's issuance and sale of APM Qualifying Securities but disapproves the use of the proceeds thereof to pay deferred Distributions, may (if the Corporation elects to so provide in the terms of such securities) permit the Corporation to use such proceeds for other purposes and to continue to defer Distributions without a breach of its obligations under the transaction documents; and
 
(f) limit the obligation of the Corporation or its Subsidiaries to issue (or use commercially reasonable efforts to issue) APM Qualifying Securities up to:
