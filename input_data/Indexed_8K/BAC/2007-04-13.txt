Effective January 1, 2007, the Corporation also started to report its results, specifically , on a managed basis. The change to a managed basis is consistent with the way that management as well as analysts and rating agencies evaluate the results of . Managed basis assumes that loans that have been securitized were not sold and presents earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold (i.e., held loans) are presented. Loan securitization is an alternative funding process that is used by the Corporation to diversify funding sources. Loan securitization removes loans from the Consolidated Balance Sheet through the sale of loans to an off-balance sheet qualified special purpose entity which is excluded from the Corporation's consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

The Corporation acquired 100 percent of the outstanding stock of MBNA Corporation (MBNA) on January 1, 2006, for $34.6 billion. MBNA's financial results were included in the Corporation's results beginning January 1, 2006.
 
The following Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Income for the periods ending in 2005 are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not indicate the financial results of the combined companies had the companies actually been combined at the beginning of the periods presented and had the impact of possible revenue enhancements, expense efficiencies, asset dispositions and share repurchases, among other factors, been considered. The 2005 Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Income are not prepared in accordance with GAAP. However, as a result of the MBNA merger, we believe that the 2005 Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Income provide a more useful year-to-year comparison versus comparing to the Corporation's historical financial information. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Income for the periods ending in 2005 gives effect to the MBNA merger as if the MBNA merger had been completed on January 1, 2005.
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Income have been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes of the Corporation and MBNA and in conjunction with the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information included in the Corporation's Current Report on Form 8-K furnished on April 10, 2006.

However, as a result of the MBNA merger, we believe that the 2005 Unaudited Pro Forma Income Statements provide a more useful year-to-year comparison versus comparing to the Corporation's historical financial information.
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Income have been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes of the Corporation and MBNA and in conjunction with the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information included in the Corporation's Current Report on Form 8-K furnished on April 10, 2006.
