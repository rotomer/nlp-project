CHARLOTTE  Bank of America Corporation today reported net income rose 5 percent in the first quarter of 2007 to $5.26 billion from $4.99 billion a year earlier. Diluted earnings per share increased 8 percent to $1.16 from $1.07. Return on average common shareholders' equity was 16.16 percent.
Excluding pretax merger and restructuring charges of $111 million, equal to 1 cent per share, the company earned $5.33 billion, or $1.17 per share, in the first quarter. A year earlier merger and restructuring charges of $98 million also were equal to 1 cent per share.
These improved results were primarily driven by increases in service fee income, investment banking income, mortgage banking income and equity investment gains. The benefits of doing more business with more customers was somewhat offset on the bottom line by the impact of a flat yield curve and normalizing credit costs.
"Bank of America is off to a solid start in 2007 despite a challenging operating environment," said Kenneth D. Lewis, chairman and chief executive officer. "We demonstrated strong customer momentum across our lines of business; added thousands of net new checking account customers thanks to innovative products like Keep the Change
; generated double-digit loan growth and deepened relationships with business and corporate clients."

First Quarter 2007 Financial Summary
Revenue
Revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis increased 3 percent to $18.42 billion from $17.94 billion in the first quarter of 2006.
Noninterest income rose 10 percent to $9.83 billion from $8.90 billion in the first quarter of 2006. Results were driven by continued strength in service fee income, investment banking income, mortgage banking income and equity investment gains.
Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was $8.60 billion compared with $9.04 billion the previous year. The decline is a result of higher cost deposits, divestitures of businesses and the impact of hedging activities. The net interest yield decreased 37 basis points to 2.61 percent.
Efficiency
The efficiency ratio on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was 49.38 percent for the first quarter of 2007 (48.78 percent excluding merger and restructuring charges). Noninterest expense increased 2 percent to $9.10 billion from $8.92 billion a year earlier. Expenses were up primarily due to higher incentive and personnel expense, reflecting investment in various business platforms.
The quarter's results also included $397 million, or 6 cents per share, in expense from the impact of SFAS 123R, which accelerates the recognition of certain equity-based compensation expenses for retirement-eligible associates. A year ago the expense was $320 million, or 5 cents per share. Also included in first quarter 2007 expenses were $111 million in pre-tax merger and restructuring charges related to the MBNA acquisition compared with $98 million a year earlier.

Credit Quality
Overall credit quality remained sound. Compared with the first quarter of 2006, net charge-offs increased reflecting portfolio seasoning and the trend toward more normalized levels post bankruptcy reform. Provision expense in the first quarter was down slightly from a year ago as higher net charge-offs were more than offset by reductions in reserves from consumer credit card securitization activities and the sale of the Argentina portfolio.
 
 
 
 
 
Capital Management
Total shareholders' equity was $134.86 billion at March 31. Period-end assets grew to $1.5 trillion. The Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 8.57 percent, down from 8.64 percent at December 31, 2006 and up from 8.45 percent a year ago.
During the quarter, Bank of America paid a cash dividend of $0.56 per share. The company also issued 28.9 million common shares related to employee stock options and ownership plans and repurchased 48.0 million common shares. Period-ending common shares issued and outstanding were 4.44 billion for the first quarter of 2007, compared with 4.46 billion for the fourth quarter of 2006 and 4.58 billion for the first quarter of 2006.

Managed revenue rose 5 percent as higher card income, service charges and mortgage banking income helped generate a 17 percent increase in noninterest income. Net income decreased 1 percent from a year ago as credit costs increased.
Bank of America's combination with MBNA continued to show positive results. Increases in card income and service charges were offset by higher managed credit costs. The increase in credit costs reflected portfolio seasoning and the trend toward more normalized levels post bankruptcy reform, partially offset by reserve reductions from consumer credit card securitization activities.

Revenue increased 1 percent as investment banking income raised noninterest income 5 percent. Net income declined 5 percent on higher provision expense and increased compensation costs, which more than offset the increase in revenue.
The revenue increase was driven by Capital Markets and Advisory Services, as investments in personnel and trading infrastructure continued to produce strong results. Investment banking revenue rose 35 percent from the first quarter of 2006, as increased market activity and deal flow continued to produce higher advisory and debt and equity underwriting fees.
Provision expense rose $90 million because of higher net charge offs resulting mainly from lower commercial recoveries.

Revenue increased 3 percent as higher customer activity and improved client asset flows resulted in an 8 percent increase in noninterest income. Net income declined 2 percent from a year ago as credit costs rose related to one client.
Asset management fees increased 12 percent from the first quarter of 2006 on higher assets under management from net asset inflows of $40 billion in addition to increased market values of more than $13 billion.

For the first quarter of 2007, All Other net income rose to $581 million from $196 million a year earlier. Equity Investment gains were $896 million, up from $571 million. Included in All Other was a net gain of $46 million and a $131 million release of credit reserves related to the divestiture of certain Latin America business operations. During the first quarter of 2006 the company recognized mark-to-market losses of approximately $175 million on certain derivatives that did not qualify for SFAS 133 hedge accounting. This did not significantly impact first quarter 2007 results.
Note: Chief Executive Officer Kenneth D. Lewis and Joseph L. Price, chief financial officer, will discuss first quarter 2007 results in a conference call at 10 a.m. (Eastern Time) today. The call can be accessed via a Webcast available on the Bank of America Investor Relations Web site at http://investor.bankofamerica.com.

Reconciliation - Managed to GAAP
(Dollars in millions; except as noted)
Effective January 1, 2007, the Corporation started to report its results, specifically, on a managed basis. The change to a managed basis is consistent with the way that management as well as analysts and rating agencies evaluate the results of . Managed basis assumes that loans that have been securitized were not sold and presents earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold (i.e., held loans) are presented. Loan securitization is an alternative funding process that is used by the Corporation to diversify funding sources. Loan securitization removes loans from the Consolidated Balance Sheet through the sale of loans to an off-balance sheet qualified special purpose entity which is excluded from the Corporation's consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Fully taxable-equivalent basis data
 
Reconciliation to GAAP financial measures
Supplemental financial data presented on an operating basis is a basis of presentation not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) that excludes merger and restructuring charges. We believe that the exclusion of merger and restructuring charges, which represent events outside our normal operations, provides a meaningful period-to-period comparison and is more reflective of normalized operations.
Shareholder value added (SVA) is a key measure of performance not defined by GAAP that is used in managing our growth strategy orientation and strengthening our focus on generating long-term growth and shareholder value. SVA is used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity (i.e., capital) at the individual unit level and is an integral component in the analytics for resource allocation. Using SVA as a performance measure places specific focus on whether incremental investments generate returns in excess of the costs of capital associated with those investments. Each business segment has a goal for growth in SVA reflecting the individual segment's business and customer strategy.
Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. See the tables below for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the quarters ended March 31, 2007, December 31, 2006, September 30, 2006, June 30, 2006, and March 31, 2006.
