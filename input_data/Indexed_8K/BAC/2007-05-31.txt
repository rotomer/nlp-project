New York, New York May 23, 2007
To the Representatives named in Schedule I hereto of theUnderwriters named in Schedule II hereto
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:
Bank of America Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to sell to the underwriters named in Schedule II hereto (the "Underwriters"), for whom you are acting as Representatives (the "Representatives"), the principal amount of one or more series of its subordinated debt securities (the "Securities"), as identified in Schedule I hereto.  The Securities will be issued under an indenture dated as of January 1, 1995 between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of August 28, 1998 and the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of January 25, 2007 (as so supplemented, the "Indenture").  The Securities are described more fully in the Prospectus referred to below.  If the firm or firms listed in Schedule II hereto include only the firm or firms listed in Schedule I hereto, then the terms "Underwriters" and "Representatives", as used herein, each shall be deemed to refer to such firm or firms. 
1.         Representations and Warranties.
(a)        The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each Underwriter that:
(i)         The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-133852), which contains a base prospectus (the "Base Prospectus"), to be used in connection with the public offering and sale of the Securities.  Such registration statement, as amended, including the financial statements, exhibits and schedules thereto and including any required information deemed to be a part thereof pursuant to Rule 430B under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Securities Act") or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act"), at each time of effectiveness, is called the "Registration Statement."  Any preliminary prospectus supplement to the Base Prospectus that describes the Securities and the offering thereof and is used prior to filing of the Prospectus is called, together with the Base Prospectus, a "preliminary prospectus."  The term "Prospectus" shall mean the final prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, together with the Base Prospectus, that is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) after the date and time that this Agreement is executed and delivered by the parties hereto (the "Execution Time").  Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus  
 shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S3 under the Securities Act; any reference to any amendment or supplement to any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date of such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Exchange Act, and incorporated by reference in such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, and any reference to any amendment to the Registration Statement shall be deemed to refer to and include any annual report of the Company filed pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act after the effective date of the Registration Statement that is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.  All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, a preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing, shall include any copy thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR").  Any preliminary Canadian offering memorandum that describes the Securities and the offering thereof, which includes the preliminary prospectus and is used in Canada prior to the filing of the Prospectus, is called the "Preliminary Canadian Offering Memorandum."  The final Canadian offering memorandum that describes the Securities and the offering thereof, which includes the Prospectus, is called the "Canadian Offering Memorandum."
(ii)        The term "Disclosure Package," as to each series of Securities, shall mean (A) the preliminary prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented, (B) the Base Prospectus; (C) the applicable issuer free writing prospectuses as defined in Rule 433 of the Securities Act (each, an "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus"), if any, identified in Schedule III hereto; (D) the Preliminary Canadian Offering Memorandum; and (E) any other free writing prospectus that the parties hereto shall hereafter expressly agree in writing to treat as part of that Disclosure Package.  As of 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the date of this Agreement (the "Initial Sale Time"), each Disclosure Package did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  The preceding sentence does not apply to statements in or omissions from a Disclosure Package based upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 7(b) hereof (the "Underwriter Information").
(iii)       As of the date hereof, when the Prospectus is first filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, when any supplement or amendment to the Prospectus is filed with the Commission, at the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) and, with respect to the Registration Statement in (A) and (B) below, as of the Initial Sale Time, (A) the Registration Statement is effective and the Registration Statement, as amended as of any such time, the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of any such time, and the Indenture complied, complies or will comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (the "Trust Indenture Act"), and the Exchange Act, (B) the Registration Statement, as amended as of any such time, did not, does not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, and (C) the Prospectus and the Canadian Offering Memorandum, as amended or supplemented as of any                                                                                  2
 such time, did not, does not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that the Company makes no representations or warranties as to (I) that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification of the Trustee (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee or (II) the Underwriter Information.  The documents which are incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, each Disclosure Package, the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus or from which information is so incorporated by reference, when they were filed with the Commission, complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and did not, when such documents were so filed, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  The Commission has not issued any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any order preventing or suspending the use of the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, and the Company is without knowledge that any proceedings have been instituted for either purpose. 
(iv)       No Canadian securities regulatory authority has issued any order preventing or suspending the use of the Preliminary Canadian Offering Memorandum or the Canadian Offering Memorandum, and the Company is without knowledge that any proceeding has been initiated for such purposes.
(v)        (A) At the earliest time after the Company or another offering participant made a offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2) of the Securities Act) and (B) as of the date of the execution and delivery of this Agreement (with such date being used as a determination date for purposes of this clause (B)), the Company neither was nor is an Ineligible Issuer (as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act).
bona fide
(vi)       No Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (including any Final Term Sheet), as of its issue date and at all subsequent times through the completion of the offering contemplated hereby or until any earlier date that the Company notified or notifies the Representatives as described in the next sentence, included, includes or will include any information that conflicted, conflicts, or will conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement, including any document incorporated by reference therein, the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, that had not or has not been superseded or modified.  If at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and prior to the end of the Prospectus Delivery Period (as defined below), there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, the Company has promptly notified or will promptly notify the Representatives and has promptly amended or supplemented or will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict.  The foregoing two sentences do not apply to statements in or omissions from an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus based upon and in conformity with Underwriter Information.                                                                                3
 
(vii)      The Company has not distributed and will not distribute, prior to the later of the Closing Date and the completion of the Underwriters' distribution of the Securities, any offering material in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities other than the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus, the Preliminary Canadian Offering Memorandum, the Canadian Offering Memorandum, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus reviewed and consented to by the Underwriters and included in Schedule III hereto.
(viii)      (A) At the time of filing the Registration Statement, (B) at the time of the most recent amendment thereto for the purposes of complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act (whether such amendment was by post-effective amendment, incorporated report filed pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or form of prospectus), (C) at the time the Company or any person acting on its behalf (within the meaning, for this clause only, of Rule 163(c) of the Securities Act) made any offer relating to the Securities in reliance on the exemption of Rule 163 under the Securities Act, and (D) at the Execution Time (with such time being used as the determination time for purposes of this clause (D)), the Company was and is a "wellknown seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act.  The Registration Statement is an "automatic shelf registration statement," as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act, the Company has not received from the Commission any notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act objecting to use of the automatic shelf registration statement form and the Company has not otherwise ceased to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form.
(b)        Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, represents and agrees that:
(i)         it has not and will not, directly or indirectly, offer, sell or deliver any of the Securities or distribute the preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any other offering materials (including any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, other free writing prospectuses, the Preliminary Canadian Offering Memorandum, or the Canadian Offering Memorandum) relating to the Securities in or from any jurisdiction except under circumstances that will, to the best of its knowledge and belief, result in compliance with any applicable laws and regulations thereof and that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, will not impose any obligations on the Company except as set forth herein; and
(ii)        it will comply in all material respects with the selling restrictions set forth in the Preliminary Canadian Offering Memorandum, the Canadian Offering Memorandum, the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus under the captions "Canadian Selling Restrictions" and "Underwriting-Selling Restrictions," as applicable.
2.         Purchase and Sale.  Subject to the terms and conditions and in reliance upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, the Company agrees to sell to each Underwriter, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, at the purchase price set forth in Schedule I hereto, the principal amount of the Securities set forth opposite such Underwriter's name in Schedule II hereto.
3.         Delivery and Payment.  Delivery of and payment for the Securities shall be made on the date and at the time specified in Schedule I hereto, which date and time may be postponed by agreement between the Representatives and the Company or as provided in Section 8 hereto                                                                                  4
 (such date and time of delivery and payment for the Securities being herein called the "Closing Date").  Delivery of the Securities shall be made to the Representatives for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters against payment by the several Underwriters through the Representatives of the purchase price thereof in the manner set forth in Schedule I hereto.  Unless otherwise agreed, certificates for the Securities shall be in book-entry form, and such certificates shall be deposited with CDS Clearing and Depository Services, Inc., in the name of CDS & Co.
4.         Agreements.  The Company agrees with the several Underwriters that:
(a)        During the period beginning on the Initial Sale Time and ending on the later of the Closing Date or such date, as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, the Prospectus is no longer required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Underwriter or dealer (except for delivery requirements imposed because such Underwriter or dealer is an affiliate of the Company), including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 (the "Prospectus Delivery Period"), the Company will not file any amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement to the Base Prospectus or a Disclosure Package (including the Prospectus) unless the Company has furnished you a copy for your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object.  Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Company will cause the Prospectus to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 via EDGAR.  The Company will advise the Representatives promptly (i) when the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424, (ii) when any amendment to the Registration Statement or the Disclosure Package relating to a series of Securities shall have become effective, (iii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or amendment of or supplement to the Prospectus or a Disclosure Package or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose, (v) of the issuance by any Canadian securities regulatory authority of any order suspending the use of the Canadian Offering Memorandum or any trading in the Securities, and (vi) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose.  The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.
(b)        If, at any time during the Prospectus Delivery Period, except with respect to any such delivery requirement imposed upon an affiliate of the Company in connection with any secondary market sales, any event occurs as a result of which each Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made or then prevailing, as the case may be, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend or supplement each Disclosure Package or the Prospectus to comply with the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, the Company promptly will prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the first sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 4, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment or supplement which will effect such compliance (including, if consented to by the Representatives, by means of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus), and will give immediate notice,                                                                                5
 and confirm in writing, to the Underwriters to cease the solicitation of offers to purchase the Securities, and furnish to the Underwriters a reasonable number of copies of such amendment or supplement.
(c)        The Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representatives as soon as practicable, but not later than 60 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement (in form complying with the provisions of Rule 158 under the Securities Act) covering a twelve-month period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the "effective date" (as defined in said Rule 158) of the Registration Statement.
(d)        The Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and each amendment thereto which shall become effective on or prior to the Closing Date and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Securities Act, as many copies of the preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus, or the Canadian Offering Memorandum and any amendments thereof and supplements thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request.  The Company will pay the expenses of printing all documents relating to the offering.
(e)        The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may reasonably designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will arrange for the determination of the legality of the Securities for purchase by investors; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general or unlimited service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
(f)         Until the business day following the Closing Date, the Company will not, without the consent of the Representatives, offer or sell, or announce the offering of, any securities covered by the Registration Statement or by any other registration statement filed under the Securities Act; provided, however, the Company may, at any time, offer or sell or announce the offering of securities (i) covered by a registration statement on Form S-8 or (ii) covered by a registration statement on Form S-3 and (A) pursuant to which the Company issues securities under one of the Company's medium-term note programs (including, without limitation, the Company's Series K Medium-Term Note Program and the Company's InterNotes Program), (B) pursuant to which the Company issues securities for its dividend reinvestment plan, (C) pursuant to which the Company and affiliated trusts issue trust preferred securities and related securities in underwritten offerings in which the lead manager is Banc of America Securities LLC (under the Registration Statement No. 333-133852), or (D) pursuant to which affiliates of the Company offer securities of the Company in secondary market transactions.
(g)        As to each series of the Securities, the Company will prepare a final term sheet containing only a description of such series, in a form approved by the Representatives and contained in Schedule IV of this Agreement, and will file each such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act as promptly as possible, but in any case not later than the time required by such rule (each such term sheet, a "Final Term Sheet").                                                                                     6
 
(h)        The Company represents that it has not made and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Representatives, it will not make, any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433 of the Securities Act; provided that the prior written consent of the Representatives shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule III hereto.  Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus."  The Company agrees that (i) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and (ii) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 of the Securities Act applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.  The Company consents to the use by any Underwriter of a free writing prospectus that (A) is not an "issuer free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 433, and (B) contains only (I) information describing the preliminary terms of the Securities or their offering, (II) information permitted by Rule 134 under the Securities Act or (III) information that describes the final terms of the Securities or their offering and that is included in a Final Term Sheet of the Company contemplated in paragraph (g) above.
(i)         If immediately prior to the third anniversary (the "Renewal Deadline") of the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, any of the Securities remain unsold by the Underwriters, the Company will file prior to the Renewal Deadline, if it has not already done so and is eligible to do so, a new automatic shelf registration statement relating to such Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives.  If the Company is no longer eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the Company will prior to the Renewal Deadline, if it has not already done so, file a new shelf registration statement relating to such Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives, and will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 60 days after the Renewal Deadline.  The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Securities to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement relating to the Securities.  References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be.
(j)         If at any time when any of the Securities remain unsold by the Underwriters the Company receives from the Commission a notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) or otherwise ceases to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form, the Company will (i) promptly notify the Representatives, (ii) promptly file a new registration statement or post-effective amendment on the proper form relating to such Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives, (iii) use its best efforts to cause such registration statement or post-effective amendment to be declared effective and (iv) promptly notify the Representatives of such effectiveness.  The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Securities to continue as contemplated in the registration statement that was the subject of the Rule 401(g)(2) notice or for which the Company has otherwise become ineligible.  References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.                                                                                 7
 
(k)        The Company agrees to pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) of the Securities Act without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) of the Securities Act.
5.         Conditions to the Obligations of the Underwriters.  The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company contained herein as of the date hereof, as of the date of the effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement filed prior to the Closing Date (including the filing of any document incorporated by reference therein) and as of the Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company made in any certificates furnished pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:
(a)        For the period from and after effectiveness of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date:
(i)         no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, or any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement, shall be in effect and no proceedings for such purpose shall have been instituted or threatened by the Commission, and the Company shall not have received from the Commission any notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) of the Securities Act objecting to use of the automatic shelf registration statement form (unless the Securities are duly registered in the manner contemplated by Rule 401(g)(2) to the satisfaction of the Representatives prior to the Closing Date);
(ii)        no order suspending the use of the Canadian Offering Memorandum or trading of the Securities in Canada shall be in effect, and no proceedings for such purpose shall have been instituted or threatened by any Canadian securities regulatory authority;
(iii)       the Company shall have filed the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus with the Commission (including the information required by Rule 430B under the Securities Act) in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act; or the Company shall have filed a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement containing the information required by such Rule 430B, and such post-effective amendment shall have become effective (if not automatically effective under the rules of the Commission);

 valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of such Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors now or hereafter in effect, and to equitable principles that may limit the right to specific enforcement of remedies, and further subject to 12 U.S.C. 1818(b)(6)(D) and similar bank regulatory powers and to the application of principles of public policy;

(x)        neither the issuance and sale of the Securities, nor the consummation of any other of the transactions herein contemplated nor the fulfillment of the terms hereof will conflict with, result in a breach of, or constitute a default under (A) the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company, each as amended to date, or (B) the terms of any indenture or other material agreement or instrument known to such counsel and to which the Company or the Principal Subsidiary Bank is a party or bound, or (C) any order, law or regulation known to such counsel to be applicable to the Company or the Principal Subsidiary                                                                                       10
 Bank of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body or arbitrator having jurisdiction over the Company or the Principal Subsidiary Bank; and
(xi)       such counsel is without knowledge of any rights to the registration of securities of the Company under the Registration Statement which have not been waived by the holders of such rights or which have not expired by reason of lapse of time following notification of the Company's intention to file the Registration Statement.
In rendering such opinion, but without opining in connection therewith, such counsel also shall state that, although it expresses no view as to portions of the Registration Statement, each Disclosure Package or the Prospectus consisting of financial statements and other financial, accounting and statistical information and it has not independently verified, is not passing upon and assumes no responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, each Disclosure Package, or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (other than as stated in (v) above), it has no reason to believe that such remaining portions of the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto as of the time it became effective, as of the Initial Sale Time or as of the date of such opinion, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that, subject to the foregoing with respect to financial statements and other financial, accounting and statistical information, each Disclosure Package, as of the Initial Sale Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statement therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or that the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, as of its date or as of the date of such opinion contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  Such counsel also does not pass upon, and does not assume any responsibility for, ascertaining whether or when any of the information contained in each Disclosure Package was conveyed to any purchaser of the Securities.
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of North Carolina, the United States, or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware to the extent deemed proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of counsel to the Underwriters, or upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing believed to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters; and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent deemed proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and its subsidiaries and public officials.
(c)        The Representatives shall have received from Morrison & Foerster LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Indenture, the Registration Statement, each Disclosure Package, and the Prospectus and any other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
(d)        The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by any Senior Vice President or Treasurer or any other authorized officer                                                                                         11
 of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, each Disclosure Package, and the Prospectus and this Agreement and they are without knowledge that:
(i)         the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are not true and correct with the same force and effect as though expressly made at and as of the Closing Date and the Company has not performed or complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to the Closing Date;
(ii)        any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued or any proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened by the Commission; and
(iii)       since the date of the most recent financial statements included in each Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there has been any material adverse change or any development involving a prospective material adverse change in the condition (financial or other), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in each Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
(e)        At the time this Agreement is executed, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters, dated as of the date of this Agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriters, stating in effect that:
(i)         They are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
(ii)        In their opinion, the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries audited by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission.
(iii)       On the basis of procedures (but not an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) consisting of:
(A)       Reading the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, the board of directors, executive committee and audit committee of the Company and the boards of directors of the Principal Subsidiary Bank as set forth in the minute books through a specified date not more than five business days prior to the date of delivery of such letter;
(B)       Performing the procedures specified by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for a review of interim financial information as described in Statement of Accounting Standards No. 100, Interim Financial Information,                                                                             12
 on the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus and reading the unaudited interim financial data, if any, for the period from the date of the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus to the date of the latest available interim financial data; and
(C)       Making inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters regarding the specific items for which representations are requested below;
nothing has come to their attention as a result of the foregoing procedures that caused them to believe that:
(I)        the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus, do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act and the published rules and regulations thereunder;
(II)       any material modifications should be made to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus, for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles;
(III)      (x) at the date of the latest available interim financial data and at the specified date not more than five business days prior to the date of the delivery of such letter, there was any change in the common stock and additional paid-in capital or the consolidated long-term debt (other than scheduled repayments of such debt) of the Company and the subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as compared with the amounts shown in the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus or (y) for the period from the date of the latest available financial data to a specified date not more than five business days prior to the delivery of such letter, there was any change in the common stock and additional paid-in capital or the consolidated long-term debt (other than scheduled repayments of such debt) of the Company and the subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, except in all instances for changes or decreases which the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur, or PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall state any specific changes or decreases.
(iv)       The letter shall also state that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has carried out certain other specified procedures, not constituting an audit, with respect to certain amounts, percentages and financial information which are included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus and which are specified by the Representatives and agreed to by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, and has found                                                                                 13
 such amounts, percentages and financial information to be in agreement with the relevant accounting, financial and other records of the Company and its subsidiaries identified in such letter.
In addition, on the Closing Date, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters, dated the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect set forth in this paragraph (e).
(f)         Subsequent to the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, each Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (e) of this Section 5 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or other), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement, each Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
(g)        Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
(h)        On or after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date, (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities.
(i)         There shall not have come to the Representatives' attention any facts that would cause the Representatives to believe that any Disclosure Package, as of the Initial Sale Time, or the Prospectus, at the time it was required to be delivered to a purchaser of any of the Securities, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances existing at the time of such delivery, not misleading.
If any of the conditions specified in this Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and their counsel, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives.  Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or telex confirmed in writing.

 Memorandum, or the Canadian Offering Memorandum as originally filed and of each amendment or supplement thereto, (ii) the copying of this Agreement, (iii) the preparation, issuance and delivery of the certificates for the Securities to the Underwriters, including capital duties, stamp duties and transfer taxes, if any, payable upon issuance of any of the Securities, the sale of the Securities to the Underwriters and the fees and expenses of any transfer agent or trustee for the Securities, (iv) the fees and expenses of counsel to any such transfer agent or trustee, (v) the fees and disbursements of the Company's counsel and accountants, (vi) the qualification of the Securities under state or Canadian securities laws in accordance with the provisions of Section 4(e), including filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection therewith and in connection with the preparation of any Blue Sky Survey, (vii) the printing and delivery to the Underwriters of copies of any Blue Sky Survey, (viii) the fees of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., (ix) the preparation, printing, reproduction and delivery to the Underwriters of copies of the Indenture and all supplements and amendments thereto, (x) any fees charged by rating agencies for the rating of the Securities, (xi) the fees and expenses of any depository and any nominee thereof in connection with the Securities, and (xi) any post-trade filing fees payable under applicable Canadian securities laws.

7.         Indemnification and Contribution.
(a)        The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which such Underwriter or such controlling person may become subject, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, including any information deemed to be a part thereof pursuant to Rule 430B under the Securities Act, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in each Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and to reimburse each Underwriter and each such controlling person for any and all expenses (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by Banc of America Securities LLC) as such expenses are reasonably incurred by such Underwriter or such controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense to the extent, but only                                                                                         15
 to the extent, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with the Underwriter Information or arises out of or is based upon statements in or omissions from that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification of the Trustee (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee.  The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 7(a) shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Company may otherwise have.
(b)        Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (ii) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Base Prospectus, the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, and only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), in reliance upon and in conformity with the Underwriter Information; and to reimburse the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person for any legal and other expense reasonably incurred by the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action.  The Company hereby acknowledges that the only information that the Underwriters have furnished to the Company expressly for use in the Registration Statement, each Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) are the names of the Underwriters and the statements set forth in the sixth and seventh paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting" in the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus.  The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 7(b) shall be in addition to any liabilities that each Underwriter may otherwise have.
(c)        Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure to so notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any liability other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above.  In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will                                                                                     16
 be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties.  Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (other than local counsel approved by the Representatives)), representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action) or (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
(d)        The indemnifying party under this Section 7 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(e)        If the indemnification provided for in Sections 7(a) through (d) is for any reason unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the                                                                                     17
 Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on such cover.  The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact or any such inaccurate or alleged inaccurate representation or warranty relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7(c), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.  The provisions set forth in Section 7(c) with respect to notice of commencement of any action shall apply if a claim for contribution is to be made under this Section 7; , , that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given in accordance with Section 7(c) for purposes of indemnification.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7(e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 7(e).
provided
however
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7(e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts received by such Underwriter in connection with the Securities underwritten by it.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7(e) are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their names in Schedule II.  For purposes of this Section 7(e), each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.  Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (e), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, as contemplated by the preceding paragraph.  However, the omission to so notify such party or                                                                                          18
 parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (e).
8.         Default by an Underwriter.  If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of the applicable series of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bear to the aggregate amount of such Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of the applicable series of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of such Securities, and if such non-defaulting Underwriters do not purchase all of such Securities, this Agreement will terminate as to such series of Securities without liability to any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company.  In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 8, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement, each Disclosure Package, the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
9.         Termination.  This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, or (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in the commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or Canada shall have occurred, or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or material escalation of hostilities or other calamity or crisis (in the United States, Canada or elsewhere) the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States or Canada is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable to market the Securities.
10.       Representations and Indemnities to Survive.  The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.  The provisions of Section 6 and 7 hereof and this Section 10 shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
11.       Notices.  All communications hereunder will be in writing and effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the Representatives, will be mailed, delivered or telexed and confirmed to                                                                                         19

The Offerors will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment.                                                                                     11
 
(b)        Prior to the termination of the offering of the Capital Securities, the Offerors (1) will give the Representative notice of their intention to file or prepare (i) any amendment to the Registration Statement (including any posteffective amendment) (other than with respect to a document filed with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act which will be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus and Prospectus that is not filed to correct a misstatement, an omission or non-compliance that is the subject of a notice delivered to the Underwriters pursuant to paragraph (e) below (a "Periodic Filing")), or (ii) any amendment or supplement to the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (including any revised prospectus which the Offerors propose for use by the Underwriters in connection with the offering of the Capital Securities which differs from the prospectus on file at the Commission at the time the Registration Statement became effective, whether or not such revised prospectus is required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act) (other than with respect to a Periodic Filing), will furnish the Representative with copies of any such amendment, supplement or other document within a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing or use, as the case may be, and will not file any such amendment, supplement or other document or use any such prospectus to which the Underwriters or counsel for the Underwriters shall reasonably object and (2) will furnish the Representative with copies of any document that will be incorporated by reference in the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus whether pursuant to the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise.  Subject to the foregoing, the Offerors will file the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act within the time required by such rule.
(c)        The Offerors will deliver to the Representative as many conformed copies of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein) as the Representative may reasonably request.
(d)        The Offerors will furnish to each Underwriter, from time to time during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, such number of copies of the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented) as such Underwriter may reasonably request for the purposes contemplated by the Securities Act.
(e)        If at any time when the Prospectus is required by the Securities Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Capital Securities, except with respect to any such delivery requirement imposed upon an affiliate of the Offerors in connection with any secondary market sales, any event shall occur as a result of which the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented will include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Offerors will, subject to paragraph (b) above, promptly prepare and file with the Commission such amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment which will effect such compliance (including, if consented to by the Representative, by means of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus), give immediate notice, and confirm in writing, to the Underwriters to cease the solicitation of offers to purchase the Capital Securities, and furnish to the Underwriters a reasonable number of copies of such amendment or supplement.                                                                                   12
 
(f)         The Offerors will endeavor, in cooperation with the Underwriters, to qualify the Capital Securities (and the Capital Securities Guarantee) and the Junior Subordinated Notes for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and the other jurisdictions of the United States as the Underwriters may designate; provided, however, that neither of the Offerors shall be obligated to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified.
(g)        The Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Underwriters as soon as practicable, but not later than 90 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement (which need not be audited) of the Company and its subsidiaries, covering an applicable period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the "Effective Date" (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Securities Act) of the Registration Statement, which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act.
(h)        The Offerors will use reasonable efforts to effect the listing of the Capital Securities on the New York Stock Exchange; if the Capital Securities are exchanged for Junior Subordinated Notes, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to effect the listing of the Junior Subordinated Notes on the exchange on which the Capital Securities were then listed.
(i)         The Company, during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, will file promptly all documents required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
(j)         Until the business day following the Closing Time, neither the Company nor the Trust will, without the consent of the Representative, offer or sell, or announce the offering of, any additional securities covered by the Registration Statement or by any other registration statement filed under the Act; provided, however, the Company may, at any time, offer or sell or announce the offering of any securities (i) covered by a registration statement on Form S-8 or (ii) covered by a registration statement on Form S-3, and (A) pursuant to which the Company issues securities under one of the Company's medium-term note programs (including, without limitation, the Company's Series K Medium-Term Notes program and the Company's InterNotes program), (B) pursuant to which the Company issues securities for its dividend reinvestment plan, (C) pursuant to which the Company issues securities in underwritten offerings in one or more non-U.S. currencies in which one of the lead managers is Banc of America Securities LLC, or (D) pursuant to which affiliates of the Company offer securities of the Company in secondary market transactions.
(k)        The Offerors will prepare a final term sheet containing only a description of the Capital Securities, in a form approved by the Representative and contained in Schedule D of this Agreement, and will file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act as promptly as possible, but in any case not later than the time required by such rule (such term sheet, the "Final Term Sheet").  Any such Final Term Sheet is an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus for purposes of this Agreement.
(l)         The Offerors represent that each has not made, and agree that, unless they obtain the prior written consent of the Representative, they will not make, any offer relating to the                                                                                        13

Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representative is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus."  The Offerors agree that (i) they have treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and (ii) they have complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 under the Securities Act applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.  The Offerors consent to the use by any Underwriter of a free writing prospectus that (a) is not an "issuer free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 433, and (b) contains only (i) information describing the preliminary terms of the Capital Securities or their offering, (ii) information that describes the final terms of the Capital Securities or their offering and that is included in the Final Term Sheet of the Offerors contemplated in paragraph (k) above or (iii) information permitted by Rule 134 of the Securities Act.
(m)       If immediately prior to the third anniversary (the "Renewal Deadline") of the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, any of the Capital Securities remain unsold by the Underwriters, the Company and the Trust will prior to the Renewal Deadline file, if they have not already done so and the Company is eligible to do so, a new automatic shelf registration statement relating to the Capital Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representative.  If the Company is no longer eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the Company and the Trust will prior to the Renewal Deadline, if it has not already done so, file a new shelf registration statement relating to the Capital Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representative, and will use their best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 60 days after the Renewal Deadline.  The Company and the Trust will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Capital Securities to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement relating to the Capital Securities.  References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be.

References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.                                                                                 14

(b)        Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Trust, the Trustees, the Company, each of the Company's directors, each of the Company's officers and each of the Trustees who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Trust within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which the Company or the Trust, or any such director, officer, Trustee or controlling person may become subject, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (ii) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, and only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), in reliance upon and in conformity with the                                                                                    26
 Underwriter Information; and to reimburse the Company, the Trust, or any such director, officer, Trustee or controlling person for any legal and other expense reasonably incurred by the Company, the Trust, or any such director, officer, Trustee or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action.  The Offerors hereby acknowledges that the only information that the Underwriters have furnished to the Offerors expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) are the names of the Underwriters, the sentences relating to concessions and reallowances under the caption "Underwriting" in the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus, and the paragraph relating to stabilization and syndicate covering transactions under the caption "Plan of Distribution" in the Base Prospectus.  The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 6(b) shall be in addition to any liabilities that each Underwriter may otherwise have.  Furthermore, the Representative has advised the Trust that it intends to make a market in the Capital Securities, as set forth under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus.
(c)        Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 6, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure to so notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any liability other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above.  In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties.  Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 6 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (other than local counsel approved by the Representative)), representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action) or (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within                                                                                     27
 a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
(d)        The indemnifying party under this Section 6 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(e)        If the indemnification provided for in Sections 6(a) through (d) is for any reason unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Offerors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Offerors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Offerors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Offerors, and the total underwriting commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on such cover.  The relative fault of the Offerors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact or any such inaccurate or alleged inaccurate representation or warranty relates to information supplied by the Offerors, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6(c), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.  The provisions set forth in Section 6(c) with respect to notice of commencement of any action shall apply if a claim for                                                                                   28
 contribution is to be made under this Section 6; , , that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given in accordance with Section 6(c) for purposes of indemnification.  The Offerors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6(e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 6(e).
provided
however
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6(e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts received by such Underwriter in connection with the Securities underwritten by it.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 6(e) are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their names in Schedule A.  For purposes of this Section 6(e), each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company and each Trustee of the Trust who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Trust within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company or the Trust.  Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (e), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, as contemplated by the preceding paragraph.  However, the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (e).
(f)         The Company agrees to indemnify the Trust against all losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred by the Trust under Section 6(a) hereof.
SECTION 7.   TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT.  This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representative, by notice given to the Offerors prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, or (ii) a banking moratorium or a material disruption in the commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities, or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or material escalation of hostilities or other calamity or crisis (in the United States or elsewhere) the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representative, impracticable to market the Securities.
SECTION 8.   DEFAULT BY ONE OR MORE OF THE UNDERWRITERS.  If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Time to purchase all or part of the Capital Securities that it or they are obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), the Representative shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make                                                                                    29
 arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representative shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24hour period, then:
(a)        if the number of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the Capital Securities  each of the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or 
(b)        if the number of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the Capital Securities this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any nondefaulting Underwriter, the Company, or the Trust. 
No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default. 
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representative or the Offerors shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.

THIS NOTE IS A GLOBAL SECURITY WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE INDENTURE HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AND IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A DEPOSITORY OR A NOMINEE OF A DEPOSITORY.  THIS NOTE IS NOT EXCHANGEABLE FOR NOTES REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A PERSON OTHER THAN THE DEPOSITORY OR ITS NOMINEE, EXCEPT IN THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE, AND NO TRANSFER OF THIS NOTE (OTHER THAN A TRANSFER OF THIS NOTE AS A WHOLE BY THE DEPOSITORY TO A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITORY OR BY A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITORY TO THE DEPOSITORY OR ANOTHER NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITORY) MAY BE REGISTERED EXCEPT IN THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE.
UNLESS THIS GLOBAL NOTE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CDS CLEARING AND DEPOSITORY SERVICES INC. ("CDS") TO BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY NOTE ISSUED IN RESPECT THEREOF IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CDS & CO., OR IN SUCH OTHER NAME AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE OF CDS (AND ANY PAYMENT IS MADE TO CDS & CO. OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE OF CDS), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL SINCE THE REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF, CDS & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.  THIS CERTIFICATE IS ISSUED PURSUANT TO A MASTER LETTER OF REPRESENTATIONS OF BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION TO CDS, AS SUCH LETTER MAY BE REPLACED OR AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME.
NEITHER THE HOLDER NOR ANY BENEFICIAL OWNER OF THIS GLOBAL NOTE SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST HEREON EXCEPT PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS HEREOF.
THIS NOTE IS NOT A SAVINGS ACCOUNT OR A DEPOSIT, IS NOT AN OBLIGATION OF OR GUARANTEED BY ANY BANKING OR NONBANKING AFFILIATE OF BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION, AND IS NOT INSURED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION OR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY. 
BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (herein called the "Corporation," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CDS & CO., or its registered assigns, the principal sum of FIVE HUNDRED MILLION CANADIAN DOLLARS (CAD500,000,000) on May 30, 2017 (except to the extent redeemed or repaid prior to that date).  The Corporation will pay interest on such principal amount in equal semi-annual installments in arrears on each Interest Payment Date.  Interest shall be payable commencing on the first Interest Payment Date succeeding the Original Issue Date and on each Interest Payment Date thereafter and on the Maturity Date.  If the Corporation shall default in the payment of interest due on an Interest Payment Date, then this Note shall bear interest from the next preceding Interest Payment Date for which interest has been paid, or, if no interest has been paid on the Notes, from the Original Issue Date.  
 
Interest on this Note will accrue at the Interest Rate from the Original Issue Date until the principal amount is paid or duly provided for and will be computed as described in this Note.  Interest payable on this Note on any Interest Payment Date or on the Maturity Date will include interest accrued from, and including, the preceding Interest Payment Date for which interest has been paid or duly provided for (or from, and including, the Original Issue Date if no interest has been paid or duly provided for, as the case may be) to, but excluding, such Interest Payment Date or Maturity Date, as the case may be.  If any Interest Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day (as defined below), such Interest Payment Date shall be the following day that is a Business Day (and no interest will accrue as a result of that postponement); and if the Maturity Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, principal or interest payable with respect to such Maturity Date will be paid on the next Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Maturity Date, and no additional interest shall accrue for the period from and after such Maturity Date.  Interest will be calculated using Actual/Actual (Canadian Compound Method), which means, when calculating interest due on any Interest Payment Date for a full semi-annual interest period, the day count fraction will be 30/360, and, when calculating interest for any interest period that is shorter than a full semi-annual interest period, the day count fraction will be Actual/365 (Fixed).
The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes evidencing all or a portion of the same debt as this Note) is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Interest Payment Date, whether or not a Business Day.  "Business Day" means any weekday that is not a legal holiday in New York, New York, U.S.A. or Charlotte, North Carolina, U.S.A. or in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and is not a day on which banking institutions in those cities are authorized or required by law or regulation to be closed. 
The principal of and interest on this Note are payable in immediately available funds in such coin or currency of Canada as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts, at the office or agency of the Paying Agent (as defined below) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, or such other places that the Corporation shall designate as provided in such Indenture; provided, however, that interest may be paid, at the option of the Corporation, by check mailed to the person entitled thereto at his address last appearing on the registry books of the Corporation relating to the Notes.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, payments of principal of and interest payable on the Maturity Date will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a designated account maintained in Canada upon (i) receipt of written notice by the Paying Agent from the registered holder hereof not less than one Business Day prior to the due date of such principal and (ii) presentation of this Note to BNY Trust Company of Canada, as "Paying Agent," at its corporate trust offices located at 4 King Street West, Suite 1101, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5H 1B6.  Any interest not punctually paid or duly provided for shall be payable as provided in such Indenture.  
Reference is made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof, which shall have the same effect as though fully set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee or by an authenticating agent on behalf of the Trustee by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under such Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.                                                                                        2
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Note to be duly executed, by manual or facsimile signature, under its corporate seal or a facsimile thereof.
                                                                                     3
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
Dated:  May 30, 2007
                                                                                  4
This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Securities of the Corporation unlimited in aggregate principal amount issued and to be issued under an Indenture dated as of January 1, 1995 (as supplemented from time to time, the "Indenture") between the Corporation and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (as successor trustee to The Bank of New York and herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights thereunder of the Corporation, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes (as defined herein), and the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  The series of which this Note is a part also is designated as the Corporation's 5.15% Subordinated Notes, due May 2017 (herein called the "Notes"), initially in the principal amount of CAD500,000,000.  The amount of Notes of this series may be increased by the Corporation in the future.  The Trustee initially shall act as Security Registrar and Authenticating Agent in connection with the Notes, and BNY Trust Company of Canada shall act as Paying Agent for the Notes. 
THE INDEBTEDNESS OF THE CORPORATION EVIDENCED BY THE NOTES, INCLUDING THE PRINCIPAL THEREOF AND INTEREST THEREON, IS, TO THE EXTENT AND IN THE MANNER SET FORTH IN THE INDENTURE, SUBORDINATE AND JUNIOR IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO ITS OBLIGATIONS TO HOLDERS OF SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS, AS DEFINED IN THE INDENTURE, AND EACH HOLDER OF THE NOTES, BY THE ACCEPTANCE HEREOF, AGREES TO AND SHALL BE BOUND BY SUCH PROVISIONS OF THE INDENTURE.
The Notes are not subject to any sinking fund.

Subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth below, the Corporation will pay additional amounts to the beneficial owner of this Note that is a Non-United States person in order to ensure that every net payment on this Note will not be less, due to payment of United States withholding tax, than the amount then otherwise due and payable.  For this purpose, a "net payment" means a payment by the Corporation or any paying agent, including payment of principal and interest, after deduction for any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge of the United States (other than a territory or a possession).

(London time) on the second London Banking Day immediately preceding the first day of that Interest Period.

Global Form
(a)        In connection with a Dissolution Election,
(i)         the Notes in certificated form shall be presented to the Trustee by the Property Trustee to be exchanged for one or more fully registered securities representing the aggregate principal amount of all then outstanding Notes as a Global Security to be registered in the name of the Depositary, or its nominee (a "Global Note"), and delivered by the Trustee to the Depositary for crediting to the accounts of its participants pursuant to the instructions of the Regular Trustees.  Upon any such presentation, the Company shall execute a Global Note in such aggregate principal amount and deliver the same to the Trustee for authentication and delivery in accordance with the Indenture and this Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture.  Payments on the Notes issued as a Global Note will be made to the Depositary; and
(ii)        if any Capital Securities are held in certificated form and not in book-entry form, the Notes in certificated form may be presented to the Trustee by the Property Trustee, and any Capital Security Certificate which represents Capital Securities other than Capital Securities held by the Clearing Agency or its nominee ("Non-BookEntry Capital Securities") will be deemed to represent beneficial interests in Notes presented to the Trustee by the Property Trustee having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of the Non-BookEntry Capital Securities until such Capital Security Certificates are presented to the Security Registrar for transfer or reissuance, at which time such Capital Security Certificates will be canceled and a Note, registered in the name of the holder of the Capital Security Certificate or the transferee of the holder of such Capital Security Certificate, as the case may be, with an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of the Capital Security Certificate canceled, will be executed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee for authentication and delivery in accordance with the Indenture and this Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture.  On issue of such Notes, Notes with an equivalent aggregate principal amount that were presented by the Property Trustee to the Trustee will be deemed to have been canceled.
(b)        A Global Note may be transferred, in whole but not in part, only to another nominee of the Depositary, or to a successor Depositary selected or approved by the Company or to a nominee of such successor Depositary.                                                                                         7
 
(c)        If at any time the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary or if at any time the Depositary shall no longer be registered or in good standing under the Exchange Act or other applicable statute or regulation, and a successor Depositary for such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such condition, as the case may be, the Company will execute, and, subject to Article 2 of the Indenture, the Trustee, upon written notice from the Company, will authenticate and make available for delivery the Notes in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Note in exchange for such Global Note.  In addition, the Company may at any time determine that the Notes shall no longer be represented by a Global Note.  In such event the Company will execute, and subject to Section 2.07 of the Indenture, the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officers' Certificate evidencing such determination by the Company, will authenticate and deliver the Notes in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Note in exchange for such Global Note.

Such Notes in definitive registered form issued in exchange for the Global Note shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee.  The Trustee shall deliver such Notes to the Depositary for delivery to the Persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.
SECTION 2.5 .
Interest
(a)        Each Note will bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to (i) from May 31, 2007 to June 1, 2037, Three-Month LIBOR plus a spread of 0.80% (the "Initial Coupon Rate") and (ii) thereafter, Three-Month LIBOR plus a spread of 1.80% (the "Step-Up Coupon Rate" and together with the Initial Coupon Rate, the "Coupon Rate"), until the principal thereof becomes due and payable, and on any overdue principal and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest or Deferred Interest at the applicable Coupon Rate or Rates, compounded quarterly, payable (subject to the provisions of Article 4) quarterly in arrears on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), beginning on September 1, 2007, to the Person in whose name such Note or any predecessor Note is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such interest installment, which, in respect of any Notes of which the Property Trustee is the Holder of a Global Note, shall be the close of business on the Business Day in New York and Charlotte next preceding that Interest Payment Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if the Notes are no longer in book-entry only form, the relevant record dates shall be the close of business on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 prior to the regular Interest Payment Date.  Interest for the final Interest Period will be paid on the Maturity Date or date of earlier prepayment pursuant to Article 3.   
(b)        The Coupon Rate will reset quarterly on each Interest Reset Date.  For each Interest Period, the Calculation Agent will determine Three-Month LIBOR in effect on the Interest Determination Date for the relevant Interest Period and will add the applicable spread to Three-Month LIBOR as determined on that Interest Determination Date to calculate the Coupon                                                                                      8
 Rate applicable for that Interest Period.  If an Interest Reset Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, that Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day.  
(c)        The amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in the period and a 360day year.  Accrued interest on the Notes will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of the Notes by an accrued interest factor, which is the sum of the interest factors calculated for each day in the relevant Interest Period.  The daily interest factor will be computed by dividing the Coupon Rate in effect on that day by 360.  In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day, except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.  In each such case, except for the Interest Payment Date falling on the Maturity Date, the Interest Periods and Interest Reset Dates will be adjusted accordingly to calculate the amount of interest payable on the Notes.
(d)        If, at any time while the Property Trustee is the Holder of any Notes, the Trust or the Property Trustee is required to pay any taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature (other than withholding taxes) imposed by the United States, or any other domestic taxing authority, then, in any case, the Company will pay as additional interest ("Additional Interest") on the Notes held by the Property Trustee, such additional amounts as shall be required so that the net amounts received and retained by the Trust and the Property Trustee after paying such taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges will be equal to the amounts the Trust and the Property Trustee would have received had no such taxes, duties, assessments or other government charges been imposed.

If a Special Event has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall have the right, upon not less than 30 days' nor more than 60 days' notice to the Holders of the Notes, to prepay the Notes, in whole but not in part, for cash within 90 days following the occurrence of such Special Event (the "90-Day Period") at a prepayment price equal to the Special Event Prepayment Price.  The Special Event Prepayment Price shall be paid prior to 12:00 noon, New York time, on the date of such prepayment or such earlier time as the Company determines, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount sufficient to pay the Special Event Prepayment Price by 10:00 a.m., New York time, on the date such Special Event Prepayment Price is to be paid.

Any prepayment                                                                                    9

The Optional Prepayment Price shall be paid prior to 12:00 noon, New York time, on the date of such prepayment or at such earlier time as the Company determines provided that the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount sufficient to pay the Optional Prepayment Price by 10:00 a.m., New York time, on the date such Optional Prepayment Price is to be paid.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, interest, the payment of which has been deferred because of the extension of the interest payment period pursuant to this Section 4.1, will accrue additional interest thereon at the applicable Coupon Rate or Rates compounded quarterly for each quarter of the Extended Interest Payment Period ("Compounded Interest").  At the end of the Extended Interest Payment Period, the Company shall pay all interest accrued and unpaid on the Notes, including any Additional Interest and Compounded Interest (together, "Deferred Interest") that shall be payable to the Holders of the Notes in whose names the Notes are registered in the Security Register on the first record date after the end of the Extended Interest Payment Period.  Before the termination of any Extended Interest Payment Period, the Company may further extend such period, provided that such period together with all such previous and further extensions thereof shall not exceed 20 consecutive quarters or extend beyond the Maturity Date of the Notes.  Upon the termination of any Extended Interest Payment Period and upon the payment of all Deferred Interest then due, the Company may commence a new Extended Interest Payment Period, subject to the foregoing requirements.  No interest shall be due and payable during an Extended Interest Payment Period, except at the end thereof, but the Company may prepay at any time all or any portion of the interest accrued during an Extended Interest Payment Period.                                                                                           10

As used herein, the term "Business Day" shall mean any day other than a day on which federal or state banking institutions in New York, New York, or Charlotte, North Carolina, are authorized or obligated by law, executive order or regulation to close and also is a London Banking Day.  "London Banking Day" shall mean any day on which commercial banks are open for general business (including dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars) in London, England.
For each Interest Period, the Calculation Agent will determine Three-Month LIBOR in effect on the Interest Determination Date for that Interest Period and will add the Initial Spread or the Step-Up Spread, as applicable, to Three-Month LIBOR as determined on that Interest Determination Date to calculate the Coupon Rate applicable for that Interest Period.  "Three-Month LIBOR" means, with respect to any Interest Period, the offered rate (expressed as a percentage perannum) for deposits in U.S. dollars for a three-month period commencing on the first day of that Interest Period that appears on Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 A.M. (London                                                                                    15
 time) on the second London Banking Day immediately preceding the first day of that Interest Period. If the rate described above does not appear on Telerate Page 3750, Three-Month LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates at which deposits in U.S. dollars for a three-month period commencing on the first day of that Interest Period and in a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000 are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in the London interbank market selected by the Calculation Agent, after consultation with the Company, at approximately 11:00 A.M., London time on the second London Banking Day immediately preceding the first day of that Interest Period.  The Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of such banks to provide a quotation of its rate.  If at least two such quotations are provided, Three-Month LIBOR with respect to that Interest Period will be the arithmetic average (rounded upward if necessary to the nearest .00001 of 1%) of such quotations.  If fewer than two quotations are provided, Three-Month LIBOR with respect to that Interest Period will be the arithmetic average (rounded upward if necessary to the nearest .00001 of 1%) of the rates quoted by three major banks in New York, New York, selected by the Calculation Agent, at approximately 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the first day of that Interest Period for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks for a three-month period commencing on the first day of that Interest Period and in a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000.  However, if fewer than three banks selected by the Calculation Agent to provide quotations are not quoting as described above, Three-Month LIBOR for that Interest Period will be the same as Three-Month LIBOR as determined for the previous Interest Period, or in the case of the first Interest Period, the most recent rate that could have been determined in accordance with the first sentence of this paragraph had the Notes been outstanding. 
The indebtedness evidenced by this Note is, to the extent provided in the Indenture, subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Obligations (as defined in the Indenture and the Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture) and this Note is issued subject to the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto.  Each Holder of this Note, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his or her behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination so provided and (c) appoints the Trustee his or her attorneyinfact for any and all such purposes.  Each Holder hereof, by his or her acceptance hereof, hereby waives all notice of the acceptance of the subordination provisions contained herein and in the Indenture by each holder of Senior Obligations, whether now outstanding or hereafter incurred, and waives reliance by each such holder upon said provisions.

SECTION 9.5 . 
Notices to Clearing Agency

SECTION 9.7 . 
Definitive Capital Security Certificates
If:
(a)           a Clearing Agency elects to discontinue its services as securities depositary with respect to the Capital Securities and a successor Clearing Agency is not appointed within 90 days after such discontinuance pursuant to Section 9.6; or

(d)           upon surrender of the Global Securities by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration instructions, the Regular Trustees shall cause Definitive Capital Security Certificates to be delivered to Capital Security Beneficial Owners in accordance with the instructions of the Clearing Agency.  Neither the Trustees nor the Trust shall be liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and each of them may conclusively rely on and shall be protected in relying on, said instructions of the Clearing Agency.  The Definitive Capital Security Certificates shall be typed, printed, lithographed or engraved or may be produced in any other manner as is reasonably acceptable to the Regular Trustees, as evidenced by their execution thereof, and may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification or designation and such legends or endorsements as the Regular Trustees may deem appropriate, or as may be required to comply with any law or with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or with any rule or regulation of any stock exchange on which Capital Securities may be listed, or to conform to usage.

In connection with the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section 9.8, the Regular Trustees may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith.  Any duplicate Certificate issued pursuant to this Section shall constitute conclusive evidence of an ownership interest in the relevant Securities, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate shall be found at any time.                                                                                       36

(b)           An Indemnified Person shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the records of the Trust and upon such information, opinions, reports or statements presented to the Trust by any Person as to matters the Indemnified Person reasonably believes are within such other Person's professional or expert competence and who has been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of the Trust, including information, opinions, reports or statements as to the value and amount of the assets, liabilities, profits, losses, or any other facts pertinent to the existence and amount of assets from which Distributions to Holders of Securities might properly be paid.                                                                                  37
 
SECTION 10.3   . 
Fiduciary Duty
(a)           To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Indemnified Person has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Trust or to any other Covered Person, an Indemnified Person acting under this Declaration shall not be liable to the Trust or to any other Covered Person for its good faith reliance on the provisions of this Declaration.  The provisions of this Declaration, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of an Indemnified Person otherwise existing at law or in equity (other than the duties imposed on the Property Trustee under the Trust Indenture Act), are agreed by the parties hereto to replace such other duties and liabilities of such Indemnified Person.
(b)        Unless otherwise expressly provided herein:

(i)            in its "discretion" or under a grant of similar authority, the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to consider such interests and factors as it desires, including its own interests, and shall have no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting the Trust or any other Person; or
(ii)           in its "good faith" or under another express standard, the Indemnified Person shall act under such express standard and shall not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by this Declaration or by applicable law.                                                                            38

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Company Indemnified Person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
nolo contendere
(ii)           The Note Issuer shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any Company Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Trust to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a Company Indemnified Person against expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust and except that no such indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such Company Indemnified Person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Trust unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
(iii)          To the extent that a Company Indemnified Person shall be successful on the merits or otherwise (including dismissal of an action without prejudice or the settlement of an action without admission of liability) in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified, to the full extent permitted by law, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.
(iv)          Any indemnification under paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a) (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Note Issuer only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the                                                                            39
 Company Indemnified Person is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in paragraphs (i) and (ii).  Such determination shall be made (A) by the Regular Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of such Regular Trustees who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, (B) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (C) by the Holders of the Common Securities.
(v)           Expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by a Company Indemnified Person in defending a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a) shall be paid by the Note Issuer in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Company Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Note Issuer as authorized in this Section 10.4(a).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance shall be made by the Note Issuer if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (A) by the Regular Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees, (B) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (C) the Common Security Holder of the Trust, that, based upon the facts known to the Regular Trustees, counsel or the Common Security Holder at the time such determination is made, such Company Indemnified Person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such Company Indemnified Person believed or had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.  In no event shall any advance be made in instances where the Regular Trustees, independent legal counsel or Common Security Holder reasonably determine that such person deliberately breached his duty to the Trust or to the Holders of the Common or Capital Securities.
(vi)          The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other paragraphs of this Section 10.4(a) shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification and advancement of expenses may be entitled under any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors of the Note Issuer or Capital Security Holders of the Trust or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.  All rights to indemnification under this Section 10.4(a) shall be deemed to be provided by a contract between the Note Issuer and each Company Indemnified Person who serves in such capacity at any time while this Section 10.4(a) is in effect.  Any repeal or modification of this Section 10.4(a) shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing.
(vii)         The Note Issuer or the Trust may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Company Indemnified Person                                                                    40
 against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Note Issuer would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Section 10.4(a).
(viii)         For purposes of this Section 10.4(a), references to "the Trust" shall include, in addition to the resulting or surviving entity, any constituent entity (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger, so that any person who is or was a director, trustee, officer or employee of such constituent entity, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent entity as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of another entity, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Section 10.4(a) with respect to the resulting or surviving entity as he would have with respect to such constituent entity if its separate existence had continued.
(ix)          The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Section 10.4(a) shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Company Indemnified Person and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
(b)           The Note Issuer agrees to indemnify the (i) Property Trustee, (ii) the Delaware Trustee, (iii) any Affiliate of the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, and (iv) any officers, directors, shareholders, members, partners, employees, representatives, custodians, nominees or agents of the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee (each of the Persons in (i) through (iv) being referred to as a "Fiduciary Indemnified Person") for, and to hold each Fiduciary Indemnified Person harmless against, any and all loss, liability, damage, claim or expense including taxes (other than taxes based on the income of such Fiduciary Indemnified Person) incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the trust or trusts hereunder, including the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) of defending itself against or investigating any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder.  The obligation to indemnify as set forth in this Section 10.4(b) shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Declaration.

Pursuant to Section 7.1 of the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, dated as of May 23, 2007 (as amended from time to time, the "Declaration"), the designation, rights, privileges, restrictions, preferences and other terms and provisions of the Capital Securities and the Common Securities are set out below (each capitalized term used but not defined herein has the meaning set forth in the Declaration);
1.         .
Designation and Number
(a)        . The Capital Securities of the Trust (liquidation amount $1,000 per Capital Security) are hereby designated for purposes of identification only as "BAC Capital Trust XV Floating Rate Capital Securities" (the "Capital Securities").  The Trust shall issue 500,000 Capital Securities with an aggregate liquidation amount of $500,000,000.  The Capital Security Certificates evidencing the Capital Securities shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 to the Declaration, with such changes and additions thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary usage, custom or practice or to conform to the rules of any stock exchange on which the Capital Securities are listed.
Capital Securities
(b)        . The Common Securities of the Trust are hereby designated for purposes of identification only as "BAC Capital Trust XV Floating Rate Common Securities" (the "Common Securities").  The Common Securities shall have an aggregate liquidation amount of $100,000.  The Common Security Certificate evidencing the Common Securities shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2 to the Declaration, with such changes and additions thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary usage, custom or practice.
Common Securities
            2.         .
Distributions
(a)        Distributions on each Security will be payable at a floating rate per annum equal to (i) for each Distribution Period from the issue date of the Securities to the Distribution Date ended June 1, 2037, Three-Month LIBOR (as defined in the Supplemental Indenture) plus a spread of 0.80% (the "Initial Coupon Rate") and (ii) for each Distribution Period after June 1, 2037, Three-Month LIBOR plus a spread of 1.80% (the "Step-Up Coupon Rate" and together with the Initial Coupon Rate, the "Coupon Rate"), each of the stated liquidation amount of $1,000 per Capital Security and of the stated liquidation amount of $1,000 per Common Security, such rate being the interest rate payable on the Notes to be held by the Property Trustee.  Distributions in arrears for more than one quarter will bear interest thereon compounded quarterly at the applicable Coupon Rate or Rates (to the extent permitted by applicable law).  A Distribution is payable only to the extent that payments are made in respect of the Notes held by the Property Trustee and to the extent the Property Trustee has funds                                                                                        I-1
 available therefor.  The amount of Distributions payable for any period will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a period and a 360-day year.  The Coupon Rate and the amount of accumulated distributions payable for each Distribution Period will correspond to the interest rate and the amount of accrued interest payable on the Notes for each Interest Period (as defined in the Supplemental Indenture), as determined in accordance with the terms of the Supplemental Indenture.    
(b)        Distributions on the Securities will be cumulative, will accrue from May 31, 2007 and will be payable quarterly in arrears on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2007, except as otherwise described below.  The Note Issuer has the right under the Indenture to defer payments of interest on the Notes by extending the Interest Payment Period on the Notes from time to time for a period selected by the Note Issuer not exceeding 20 consecutive quarters (each, an "Extension Period"), during which Extension Period no interest shall be due and payable on the Notes, no Extension Period may extend beyond the Stated Maturity.  As a consequence of such deferral, Distributions also will be deferred on the Capital Securities for the same period.  Despite such deferral, quarterly Distributions will continue to accrue with interest thereon (to the extent permitted by applicable law) at the applicable Coupon Rate or Rates compounded quarterly during any such Extension Period.  Prior to the termination of any such Extension Period, the Note Issuer may extend further such Extension Period; such Extension Period together with all such previous and further extensions thereof may not exceed 20 consecutive quarters or extend beyond the Stated Maturity.  Payments of accrued Distributions will be payable to Holders as they appear on the books and records of the Trust or the Clearing Agency, as the case may be, on the first record date after the end of the Extension Period.  Upon the termination of any Extension Period and the payment of all amounts then due, the Note Issuer may commence a new Extension Period, subject to the above requirements.  No interest or corresponding Distributions shall be due and payable during an Extension Period, except at the end thereof, but the Note Issuer may repay at any time all or any portion of the interest accrued during an Extension Period.

(c)        Distributions on the Securities will be payable to the Holders thereof as they appear on the books and records of the Trust on the relevant record dates.  While the Capital Securities remain in BookEntry only form, the relevant record dates shall be one Business Day prior to the relevant Distribution Payment Dates, which Distribution Payment Dates correspond to the Interest Payment Dates on the Notes.  Payment of Distributions on the Securities held in Book-Entry only form will be made to the Depositary in immediately available funds.  The Depositary's practice is to credit Clearing Agency Participants' accounts on the relevant Distribution Payment Date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on the Depositary's records unless the Depositary has reason to believe that it will not receive payments on such Distribution Payment Date.  Payments by (i) Clearing Agency Participants and (ii) securities brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies and other entities that clear transactions through or maintain a direct or indirect custodial relationship with a Clearing Agency Participant (an "Indirect Participant") to Capital Security Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of such Clearing Agency Participants and Indirect Participants and not of the Depositary, the Trust or the Company, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.  Payment of Distributions to the Depositary is the responsibility of the Trust, disbursement of                                                                                         I-2
 such payments to Clearing Agency Participants is the responsibility of the Depositary, and disbursement of such payments to the Capital Security Beneficial Owners is the responsibility of the Clearing Agency Participants and Indirect Participants.  The relevant record dates for the Common Securities shall be the same record date as for the Capital Securities.  If the Capital Securities shall no longer remain in BookEntry only form, the regular record dates for the Capital Securities shall be the close of business on the February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 prior to the relevant Distribution Payment Dates, which Distribution Payment Dates correspond to the Interest Payment Dates on the Notes.  Distributions payable on any Securities that are not punctually paid on any Distribution Payment Date, as a result of the Note Issuer having failed to make a payment under the Notes, will cease to be payable to the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the relevant record date, and such defaulted Distribution will instead be payable to the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the special record date or other specified date determined in accordance with the Indenture.  If any date on which Distributions are payable on the Securities is not a Business Day, then payment of the Distribution payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day as if it were the date of payment, except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.  In each such case, except for the Distribution Payment Date falling on the maturity date of the Notes, the Distribution Periods will be adjusted accordingly to calculate the amount of distributions payable on the Capital Securities.
(d)        In the event that there is any money or other property held by or for the Trust that is not accounted for hereunder, such property shall be distributed Pro Rata (as defined herein) among the Holders of the Securities.
            3.         .
Liquidation Distribution Upon Dissolution
In the event of any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, winding-up or termination of the Trust, the Holders on the date of the dissolution, winding-up or termination, as the case may be, will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Trust available for distribution to Holders after satisfaction of liabilities of creditors an amount equal to the aggregate of the stated liquidation amount of $1,000 per Capital Security and to the aggregate of the stated liquidation amount of $1,000 per Common Security plus accrued and unpaid Distributions thereon to the date of payment (such amount being the "Liquidation Distribution"), unless, in connection with such dissolution, windingup or termination, Notes in an aggregate stated principal amount equal to the aggregate stated liquidation amount of such Securities, with an interest rate equal to the Coupon Rate of, and bearing accrued and unpaid interest in an amount equal to the accrued and unpaid Distributions on, such Securities, shall be distributed on a Pro Rata basis to the Holders of the Securities in exchange for such Securities.
If, upon any such dissolution, the Liquidation Distribution can be paid only in part because the Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then the amounts payable directly by the Trust on the Securities shall be paid on a Pro Rata basis.  Holders of the Common Securities will be entitled to receive distributions upon any such dissolution Pro Rata with Holders of the Capital Securities, except that if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Capital Securities shall have a preference over the Common Securities with respect to such distributions.                                                                                 I-3
 
            4.         .
Redemption and Distribution
(a)        The Securities are subject to redemption at the Stated Maturity, at any time on or after June 1, 2037, and in certain circumstances, following the occurrence of a Special Event as follows:
(i)         Upon payment of the Notes at a payment price equal to the principal amount of the Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon at the Stated Maturity, including any deferred payments of interest on the Notes, the proceeds from such payment shall be applied simultaneously to redeem the Securities at the Maturity Redemption Price.
(ii)        In the event of a Special Event Prepayment, the proceeds from such Special Event Prepayment shall be applied simultaneously to redeem the Securities at the Special Event Redemption Price.

For purposes of the calculation of the redemption date or exchange date and the dates on which notices are given pursuant to this Section 4(d)(i), a Redemption/ Distribution Notice shall be deemed to be given on the day such notice is first mailed by firstclass mail, postage prepaid, to Holders of Securities.  Each Redemption/Distribution Notice shall be addressed to the Holders of Securities at the address of each such Holder appearing in the books and records of the Trust.  No defect in the Redemption/Distribution Notice or in the mailing of either with respect to any Holder shall affect the validity of the redemption or exchange proceedings with respect to any other Holder.

(iii)       If Securities are to be redeemed and the Trust gives a Redemption/Distribution Notice, which notice may only be issued if the Notes are repaid as set out in this Section 4 (which notice will be irrevocable), then (A) while the Capital Securities are in Book-Entry only form, with respect to the Capital Securities, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the redemption date, provided that the Note Issuer has paid the Property Trustee a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the related prepayment or maturity of the Notes, the Property Trustee will deposit irrevocably with the Depositary or its nominee (or successor Clearing Agency or its nominee) funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price with respect to the Capital Securities and will give the Depositary irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of the Capital Securities, and (B) with respect to Capital Securities issued in definitive form and Common Securities, the Note Issuer has paid the Property Trustee a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the related prepayment or maturity of the Notes, the Property Trustee will pay the relevant Redemption Price to the Holders of such Securities by check mailed to the address of the relevant Holder appearing on the books and records of the Trust on the redemption date.  If a Redemption/Distribution Notice shall have been given and funds deposited as required, if applicable, then immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such deposit, or on the redemption date, as applicable, Distributions will cease to accrue on the Securities so called                                                                              I-5

If any date fixed for redemption of Securities is not a Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day falls in the next calendar month, such payment will be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date fixed for redemption.  If payment of the Redemption Price in respect of any Securities is improperly withheld or refused and not paid either by the Property Trustee or by the Sponsor as guarantor pursuant to the relevant Securities Guarantee, Distributions on such Securities will continue to accrue from the original redemption date to the actual date of payment, in which case the actual payment date will be considered the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the Redemption Price.
(iv)       Redemption/Distribution Notices shall be sent by the Regular Trustees on behalf of the Trust to (A) in respect of the Capital Securities,the Depositary or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee) if the Global Securities have been issued or, if Definitive Capital Security Certificates have been issued, to the Holder thereof, and (B) in respect of the Common Securities to the Holder thereof.

Distributions in arrears for more than one quarter will bear interest thereon, to the extent permitted by applicable law, at the Coupon Rate or Rates applicable during the Distribution Period or Periods, compounded quarterly.  A Distribution is payable only to the extent that payments are made in respect of the Notes held by the Property Trustee and to the extent the Property Trustee has funds available therefor.

As a consequence of such deferral, Distributions also will be deferred hereunder for the same period.  Despite such deferral, quarterly Distributions will continue to accrue with interest thereon (to the extent permitted by applicable law) at the applicable Coupon Rate or Rates compounded quarterly during any such Extension Period. Prior to the termination of any such Extension Period, the Note Issuer may further extend such Extension Period; such Extension Period together with all such previous and further extensions thereof may not exceed 20 consecutive quarters or extend beyond the maturity date of the Notes.  Payments of accrued Distributions will be payable to Holders as they appear on the books and records of the Trust on the first record date after the end of the Extension Period.  Upon the termination of any Extension Period and the payment of all amounts then due, the Note Issuer may commence a new Extension Period, subject to the above requirements.

The proceeds from the sale of the Capital Securities and Common Securities of the Trust are to be used by the Trust to purchase up to $500,100,000 aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Notes, due 2056 (the "Notes") of the Corporation to be issued under the terms of the Indenture and the Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture (each as defined herein).  We also have acted as counsel to the Corporation and the Trust in connection with the preparation of the Underwriting Agreement dated May 23, 2007 (the "Underwriting Agreement") among the Corporation, the Trust and the underwriters named in Schedule A thereto (the "Underwriters").  The terms used herein that are defined in the Underwriting Agreement have the respective meanings set forth therein, unless otherwise defined herein.

Based solely upon the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, and subject to the limitations, qualifications and exceptions set forth below, we are of the opinion that:
                1.         When (i) executed, issued and delivered by the Corporation to the Trustee for authentication in accordance with the Indenture, (ii) authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, in accordance with the Indenture, and (iii) paid for, all as contemplated in the Board Resolution or Company Order (as each is defined in the Indenture), the Notes will have been validly authorized and issued under the Indenture and will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Corporation, subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors now or hereafter in effect, and to equitable principles that may limit the right to specific performance of remedies, and further subject to 12 U.S.C. 1818(b)(6)(D) (or any successor statute) and any bank regulatory powers now or hereafter in effect and to the application of principles of public policy (the "Permitted Exceptions").
             2.        The Capital Securities Guarantee has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Corporation and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Corporation, enforceable against the Corporation in accordance with its terms, subject to the Permitted Exceptions.
