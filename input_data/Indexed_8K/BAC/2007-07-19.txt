CHARLOTTE  Bank of America Corporation today reported second quarter net income rose 5 percent to $5.76 billion from $5.48 billion a year earlier. Diluted earnings per share increased 8 percent to $1.28 from $1.19. Return on average common shareholders' equity was 17.55 percent.
All three business segments recorded revenue increases. Results were mainly driven by continued healthy capital markets activity as well as good consumer noninterest income growth.
"Bank of America, with its diverse business model, was able to continue attractive earnings growth despite challenging headwinds," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth D. Lewis. "Our businesses are doing a good job of attracting new customers and expanding our relationships with existing clients. Our investments in a number of businesses such as capital markets, mortgage and services for the affluent, in addition to the equity investment gains produced in the current environment, are generating results that more than offset spread compression impacting virtually all of our businesses and the trend toward more normalized credit costs."

  Results shown are defined by Columbia Management's calculation of its percentage of assets under management in the top two quartiles of categories based on Morningstar as of May 31, 2007. The category percentile rank was calculated by ranking the three year net return of share classes within the categories. The assets of the number of funds within the top 2 quartile results were added and then divided by Columbia Management's total assets under management. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The share class earning the ranking may have limited eligibility and may not be available to all investors.

Second Quarter 2007 Financial Summary
Revenue
Revenue net of interest expense on a fully taxable-equivalent basis increased 8 percent to $19.96 billion from $18.52 billion in the second quarter of 2006.
Noninterest income rose 17 percent to $11.18 billion from $9.59 billion in the second quarter of 2006, driven by increases in equity investment gains, other income, investment banking and service charges. Equity investment gains included a $600 million gain related to the sale of private equity funds to Conversus Capital, an investment partnership, as well as higher dividends from strategic investments.
Net interest income on a managed basis increased 1 percent to $10.73 billion compared with the year-ago quarter. Net interest income on a held basis declined 3 percent to $8.39 billion from $8.63 billion a year earlier. The net interest margin decreased 26 basis points to 2.59 percent.
Efficiency
The efficiency ratio on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was 45.56 percent for the second quarter of 2007. Noninterest expense increased 4 percent to $9.09 billion from $8.72 billion a year earlier. Expenses rose mainly because of higher incentive compensation and other personnel expenses, reflecting investment in various business platforms and an increase in litigation reserves. Higher expenses were somewhat offset by lower pretax merger and restructuring charges of $75 million compared with $194 million a year earlier.

Credit Quality
Overall credit quality remained sound, but continues to move toward more normalized levels. Compared with the second quarter of 2006, net charge-offs increased primarily reflecting seasoning and a trend toward more normalized loss levels in the consumer and small business portfolios as well as lower commercial recoveries. Provision expense in the second quarter rose from a year ago due to higher net charge-offs as well as increased reserves for portfolio seasoning and higher loss expectations in the small business and home equity portfolios reflecting the growth of these businesses.
 
 
 
 
 
Capital Management
Total shareholders' equity was $135.75 billion at June 30. Period-end assets were $1.5 trillion. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.52 percent, down from 8.57 percent at March 31 and up from 8.33 percent a year ago.
During the quarter, Bank of America paid a cash dividend of $0.56 per share. The company also issued 11.3 million common shares related to employee stock options and ownership plans and repurchased 13.5 million common shares. Period-ending common shares issued and outstanding were 4.44 billion for the second quarter of 2007, compared with 4.44 billion for the first quarter and 4.53 billion for the second quarter of 2006.

Reconciliation to GAAP financial measures
Supplemental financial data presented on an operating basis is a basis of presentation not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) that excludes merger and restructuring charges. We believe that the exclusion of merger and restructuring charges, which represent events outside our normal operations, provides a meaningful period-to-period comparison and is more reflective of normalized operations.
Return on average common shareholders' equity and return on average tangible shareholders' equity utilize non-GAAP allocation methodologies. Return on average common shareholders' equity measures the earnings contribution of a unit as a percentage of the shareholders' equity allocated to that unit. Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures the earnings contribution of the Corporation as a percentage of shareholders' equity reduced by goodwill. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity (i.e., capital) at the individual unit level and are integral components in the analytics for resource allocation. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue. We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation.
Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. See the tables below for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the quarters ended June 30, 2007, March 31, 2007, December 31, 2006, September 30, 2006, and June 30, 2006, and the six months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006.
