Euro Medium-Term Note Program
Bank of America Corporation (the "Registrant") maintains a Euro Medium-Term Note Program (the "EMTN Program") which provides for the issuance, from time to time, of its senior and subordinated debt securities in international capital markets. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Program Agreement dated as of August 21, 2006, as amended and supplemented by the Supplemental Agreement to the Amended and Restated Program Agreement dated as of July 26, 2007, between the Registrant and the Dealers named therein, the maximum aggregate principal amount authorized to be outstanding at any time under the EMTN Program is U.S. $50 billion (or the equivalent in other currencies). Under the EMTN Program, the notes are issued pursuant to the terms of an Amended and Restated Agency Agreement dated as of August 21, 2006, as amended and supplemented by the Supplemental Agreement to the Amended and Restated Agency Agreement dated as of July 26, 2007, between the Registrant and The Bank of New York (successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch), as issuing and principal paying agent. Terms of the notes, including currency, rate and maturity, are agreed between the Registrant and the purchasers of the notes at the time of sale.
Notes issued under the EMTN Program are issued pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"); are not registered under the Act; and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to a U.S. person absent registration under, or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of, the Act.
            As of the date of this report, there is approximately U.S. $28.4 billion (or its equivalent in other currencies) in principal amount of notes outstanding under the EMTN Program, leaving approximately U.S. $21.6 billion (or its equivalent in other currencies) available for issuance under the EMTN Program.
