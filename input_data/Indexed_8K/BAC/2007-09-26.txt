Dated:  September 26, 2007

New York, New York September 20, 2007
To the Representative named in Schedule I hereto of the Underwriters named in Schedule II hereto
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:
Bank of America Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to issue and sell to the underwriters named in Schedule II hereto (the "Underwriters"), for whom you are acting as representative (the "Representative"), 22,000,000 depositary shares (the "Initial Shares") each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of the Company's perpetual 6.625% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series I (the "Preferred Stock").  The Preferred Stock, when issued, will be deposited against delivery of Depositary Receipts (the "Depositary Receipts"), which will evidence the depositary shares, that are to be issued by Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as depository (the "Depository") under the Deposit Agreement dated September 20, 2007 by and among the Company, Computershare Inc., the Depository and the holders from time to time of the Depositary Receipts described therein (the "Deposit Agreement").
The Company also grants to the Underwriters, severally and not jointly, the option described in Section 2 to purchase up to 3,300,000 additional depositary shares, each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of the Preferred Stock (the "Option Shares"), to cover over-allotments.  The Initial Shares and the Option Shares also are referred to herein as the "Depositary Shares" and the "Shares" and, where appropriate herein, reference to the Shares includes the underlying shares of Preferred Stock.  Such Depositary Shares are to be sold to each Underwriter, acting severally and not jointly, in such amounts as are listed in Schedule II opposite the name of each Underwriter.  The Shares are described more fully in the Prospectus, referred to below.  If the firm or firms listed in Schedule II hereto include only the firm or firms listed in Schedule I hereto, then the terms "Underwriters" and "Representative," as used herein, each shall be deemed to refer to such firm or firms.
1.         .
Representations and Warranties
(a)        The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each Underwriter that:
(i)         The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-  
133852), which contains a base prospectus (the "Base Prospectus"), to be used in connection with the public offering and sale of the Shares.  Such registration statement, as amended, including the financial statements, exhibits and schedules thereto, including any required information deemed to be a part thereof pursuant to Rule 430B under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Securities Act"), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act"), at each time of effectiveness, is called the "Registration Statement."  Any preliminary prospectus supplement to the Base Prospectus that describes the Shares and the offering thereof and is used prior to filing of the Prospectus is called, together with the Base Prospectus, a "preliminary prospectus."  The term "Prospectus" shall mean the final prospectus supplement relating to the Shares, together with the Base Prospectus, that is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) after the date and time that this Agreement is executed and delivered by the parties hereto (the "Execution Time").  Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be, shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S3 under the Securities Act; any reference to any amendment or supplement to any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be, shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date of such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Exchange Act, and incorporated by reference in such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference to any amendment to the Registration Statement shall be deemed to refer to and include any annual report of the Company filed pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act after the effective date of the Registration Statement that is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.  All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, a preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing shall include any copy thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR").
(ii)        The term "Disclosure Package" shall mean (A) the preliminary prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented, (B) the Base Prospectus, (C) the applicable issuer free writing prospectuses as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act (each, an "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus"), if any, identified in Schedule III hereto; and (D) any other free writing prospectus that the parties hereto shall hereafter expressly agree in writing to treat as part of the Disclosure Package.  As of 7:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the date of this Agreement (the "Initial Sale Time"), the Disclosure Package did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  The preceding sentence does not apply to statements in or omissions from the Disclosure Package based upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists only of the information described as such in Section 8(b) hereof (the "Underwriter Information").
(iii)       As of the date hereof, when the Prospectus is first filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, when any supplement or amendment to the Prospectus is filed with the Commission, at the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) and, with respect to the Registration Statement in (A) and (B) below, as of the Initial  
 Sale Time, (A) the Registration Statement is effective, the Registration Statement, as amended as of any such time, and the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of any such time complied, complies or will comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, (B) the Registration Statement, as amended as of any such time, did not, does not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, and (C) the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of any such time, did not, does not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that the Company makes no representations or warranties as to the Underwriter Information.  The documents which are incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus or from which information is so incorporated by reference, when they were filed with the Commission, complied in all material respects with the requirements under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and did not, when such documents were so filed, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  The Commission has not issued any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any order preventing or suspending the use of the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, and the Company is without knowledge that any proceedings have been instituted for either purpose.
(iv)       (A) At the earliest time after the Company or another offering participant made a offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2) under the Securities Act) and (B) as of the date of the execution and delivery of this Agreement (with such date being used as a determination date for purposes of this clause (B)), the Company neither was nor is an Ineligible Issuer (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act).
bona fide
(v)        No Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (including any Final Term Sheet (as defined herein)), as of its date and at all subsequent times through the completion of the offering contemplated hereby or until any earlier date that the Company notified or notifies the Representative as described in the next sentence, included, includes, or will include any information that conflicted, conflicts, or will conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement, including any document incorporated by reference therein, the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, that had not or has not been superseded or modified.  If at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and prior to the end of the Prospectus Delivery Period (as defined below), there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, the Company has promptly notified or will promptly notify the Representative and has promptly amended or supplemented or will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict.  The foregoing two sentences do not apply to statements in or omissions from an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus based upon and in conformity with Underwriter Information.  
 
(vi)       The Company has not distributed and will not distribute, prior to the later of the Closing Date and the completion of the Underwriters' distribution of the Shares, any offering material in connection with the offering and sale of the Shares other than the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus reviewed and consented to by the Underwriters and included in Schedule III hereto.
(vii)      (A) At the time of filing the Registration Statement, (B) at the time of the most recent amendment thereto for the purposes of complying with Section 10(a)(3) under the Securities Act (whether such amendment was by post-effective amendment, incorporated report filed pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or form of prospectus), (C) at the time the Company or any person acting on its behalf (within the meaning, for this clause only, of Rule 163(c) under the Securities Act) made any offer relating to the Shares in reliance on the exemption of Rule 163 under the Securities Act, and (D) at the Execution Time (with such date being used as the determination date for purposes of this clause (D)), the Company was and is a "wellknown seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act.  The Registration Statement is an "automatic shelf registration statement," as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act, the Company has not received from the Commission any notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act objecting to use of the automatic shelf registration statement form and the Company has not otherwise ceased to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form.
(viii)      The Deposit Agreement has been duly authorized and, when validly executed and delivered by the Company, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties thereto, will constitute a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors now or hereafter in effect, and to equitable principles that may limit the right to specific enforcement of remedies, and further subject to 12 U.S.C. 1818(b)(6)(D) (or any successor statute) and similar bank regulatory powers and to the application of principles of public policy; the Depositary Shares are entitled to the benefits of the Deposit Agreement; and such Deposit Agreement will conform to the description thereof in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
(ix)       The Preferred Stock, including any shares of Preferred Stock subject to the over-allotment option described in Section 2 hereof, and the Depositary Shares have been duly and validly authorized for issuance and sale, and, when the Initial Shares and any Option Shares are issued and delivered against payment therefor pursuant to this Agreement, the Preferred Stock and the Depositary Shares will be duly and validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable; all corporate action required to be taken for the authorization, issue and sale of the Depositary Shares has been validly and sufficiently taken and upon deposit of the Preferred Stock with the Depository pursuant to the Deposit Agreement and the due execution by the Depository of the Deposit Agreement and the Depositary Receipts, in accordance with the Deposit Agreement, such Depositary Shares will represent legal and valid interests in the Preferred Stock; and the Preferred Stock and the Depositary Shares conform to the description thereof contained in the Registration Statement and Prospectus, as amended or supplemented.  
 
(x)        The issue and sale of the Preferred Stock and the Depositary Shares and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions thereof and of this Agreement and the Deposit Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated, and the performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder, will not contravene any provision of applicable law, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or articles of association or bylaws of the Principal Subsidiary Bank or any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or the Principal Subsidiary Bank that is material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any judgment, order or decree of any governmental body, agency or court having jurisdiction over the Company or any subsidiary; and no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or qualification with, any governmental or regulatory body is required for the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement or the Deposit Agreement, except such as may be required by the securities or Blue Sky laws of the various states in connection with the offer and sale of the Shares.
(b)        Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, represents and agrees that it has not and will not, directly or indirectly, offer, sell or deliver any of the Depositary Shares or distribute the preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any other offering materials (including any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or other free writing prospectuses) relating to the Shares in or from any jurisdiction except under circumstances that will, to the best of its knowledge and belief, result in compliance with any applicable laws and regulations thereof and that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, will not impose any obligations on the Company except as set forth herein.
2.         .  Subject to the terms and conditions and in reliance upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, the Company agrees to sell to each Underwriter, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company at the purchase price set forth in Schedule I hereto the respective number of Initial Shares set forth opposite such Underwriter's name in Schedule II hereto.
Purchase and Sale
In addition, on the basis of the representations and warranties contained herein, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company grants an option to the Underwriters, severally and not jointly, to purchase the Option Shares at the same price per share determined as provided above for the Initial Shares.  The option hereby granted will expire 30 days after the date hereof, and may be exercised, in whole or in part (but not more than once), only for the purpose of covering over-allotments upon notice by the Representative to the Company setting forth the number of Option Shares as to which the several Underwriters are exercising the option, and the time and date of payment and delivery thereof.  Such time and date of delivery (the "Date of Delivery") shall be determined by the Representative but shall not be later than seven full business days after the exercise of such option and not in any event prior to the Closing Date (as defined below).  If the option is exercised as to all or any portion of the Option Shares, the Option Shares as to which the option is exercised shall be purchased by the Underwriters severally and not jointly, in proportion to, as nearly as practicable, their respective Initial Shares underwriting obligations as set forth on Schedule II.
3.         .  Delivery of and payment for the Initial Shares shall be made on the date and at the time specified in Schedule I hereto, which date and time may be postponed by agreement between the Representative and the Company or as provided in Section  
Delivery and Payment
 9 hereto (such date and time of delivery and payment for the Initial Shares being herein called the "Closing Date").  Delivery of the Initial Shares shall be made to the Representative for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters against payment by the several Underwriters through the Representative of the purchase price thereof in the manner set forth in Schedule I hereto.  Unless otherwise agreed, Depositary Receipts for the Initial Shares shall be in book-entry form, and such Depositary Receipts may be deposited with The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") or a custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC.
In addition, in the event that any or all of the Option Shares are purchased by the Underwriters, delivery and payment for the Option Shares shall be made at the office specified for delivery of the Initial Shares in Schedule I hereto, or at such other place as the Company and the Representative shall determine, on the Date of Delivery as specified in the notice from the Representative to the Company.  Delivery of the Option Shares shall be made to the Representative against payment by the Underwriters through the Representative of the purchase price thereof to or upon the order of the Company in the manner set forth in Schedule I hereto.  Unless otherwise agreed, Depositary Receipts for the Option Shares shall be in the form set forth in Schedule I hereto, and such Depositary Receipts shall be registered in such names and in such denominations as the Representative may request not less than three full business days in advance of the Date of Delivery.
4.         .  The Company agrees with the several Underwriters that:
Agreements
(a)        During the period beginning at the Initial Sale Time and ending on the later of the Closing Date or such date, as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, the Prospectus is no longer required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Underwriter or dealer (except for delivery requirements imposed because such Underwriter or dealer is an affiliate of the Company), including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 (the "Prospectus Delivery Period"), the Company will not file any amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement to the Base Prospectus or the Disclosure Package (including the Prospectus) unless the Company has furnished you a copy for your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object.  Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Company will cause the Prospectus to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 via EDGAR.  The Company will advise the Representative promptly (i) when the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424, (ii) when any amendment to the Registration Statement or the Disclosure Package relating to the Shares shall have become effective, (iii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or amendment of or supplement to the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Shares for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose.  The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.  
 
(b)        If, at any time during the Prospectus Delivery Period, except with respect to any such delivery requirement imposed upon an affiliate of the Company in connection with any secondary market sales, any event occurs as a result of which the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made or then prevailing, as the case may be, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus to comply with the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, the Company promptly will prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the first sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 4, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment or supplement which will effect such compliance (including, if consented to by the Underwriters, by means of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus), and will give immediate notice, and confirm in writing, to the Underwriters to cease the solicitation of offers to purchase the Depositary Shares, and furnish to the Underwriters a reasonable number of copies of such amendment or supplement.
(c)        The Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representative as soon as practicable, but not later than 60 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement (in form complying with the provisions of Rule 158 under the Securities Act) covering a twelve-month period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the "effective date" (as defined in said Rule 158) of the Registration Statement.
(d)        The Company will furnish to the Representative and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and each amendment thereto which shall become effective on or prior to the Closing Date and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Securities Act, as many copies of the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus and any amendments thereof and supplements thereto as the Representative may reasonably request.  The Company will pay the expenses of printing all documents relating to the offering.
(e)        The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Depositary Shares for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representative may reasonably designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Depositary Shares and will arrange for the determination of the legality of the Depositary Shares for purchase by investors; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general or unlimited service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
(f)         Until the business day following the Closing Date, the Company will not, without the consent of the Representative, offer or sell, or announce the offering of, any securities covered by the Registration Statement or by any other registration statement filed under the Securities Act; provided, however, the Company may, at any time, offer or sell or announce the offering of securities (i) covered by a registration statement on Form S-8 or (ii) covered by a registration statement on Form S-3 and (A) pursuant to which the Company issues securities under one of the Company's medium-term note programs (including, without  
 limitation, the Company's Series K Medium-Term Note Program and the Company's InterNotes Program), (B) pursuant to which the Company issues securities for its dividend reinvestment plan, (C) senior notes to be issued pursuant to the Registration Statement in an underwritten offering in which the lead manager is Banc of America Securities LLC (under the Registration Statement No. 333-133852), or (D) pursuant to which affiliates of the Company offer securities of the Company in secondary market transactions.
(g)        The Company will prepare a final term sheet containing only a description of the Shares, in a form approved by the Representative and contained in Schedule IV of this Agreement, and will file the such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act as promptly as possible, but in any case not later than the time required by such rule (such term sheet, the "Final Term Sheet").
(h)        The Company represents that it has not made and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Representative, it will not make, any offer relating to the Shares that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433 under the Securities Act; provided that the prior written consent of the Representative shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule III hereto.  Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representative is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus."  The Company agrees that (i) it has treated and will treat as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and (ii) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 under the Securities Act applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.  The Company consents to the use by any Underwriter of a free writing prospectus that (a) is not an "issuer free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 433, and (b) contains only (i) information describing the preliminary terms of the Shares or their offering, (ii) information permitted by Rule 134 under the Securities Act or (iii) information that describes the final terms of the Shares or their offering and that is included in the Final Term Sheet of the Company contemplated in paragraph (g) above.
(i)         If immediately prior to the third anniversary (the "Renewal Deadline") of the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, any of the Shares remain unsold by the Underwriters, the Company will file prior to the Renewal Deadline, if it has not already done so and is eligible to do so, a new automatic shelf registration statement relating to the Shares, in a form satisfactory to the Representative.  If the Company is no longer eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the Company will file prior to the Renewal Deadline, if it has not already done so, a new shelf registration statement relating to the Shares, in a form satisfactory to the Representative, and will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 60 days after the Renewal Deadline.  The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Shares to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement relating to the Shares.  References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be.  
 
(j)         If at any time when Shares remain unsold by the Underwriters the Company receives from the Commission a notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) or otherwise ceases to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form, the Company will (i) promptly notify the Representative, (ii) promptly file a new registration statement or post-effective amendment on the proper form relating to the Shares, in a form satisfactory to the Representative, (iii) use its best efforts to cause such registration statement or post-effective amendment to be declared effective and (iv) promptly notify the Representative of such effectiveness.  The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Shares to continue as contemplated in the registration statement that was the subject of the Rule 401(g)(2) notice or for which the Company has otherwise become ineligible.  References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.
(k)        The Company agrees to pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Shares within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) under the Securities Act without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) under the Securities Act.
5.         .  The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Shares shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company contained herein as of the date hereof, as of the date of the effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement filed prior to the Closing Date (including the filing of any document incorporated by reference therein) and as of the Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company made in any certificates furnished pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:
Conditions to the Obligations of the Underwriters
(a)        For the period from and after effectiveness of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date:

(xiv)     such counsel is without knowledge of any rights to the registration of securities of the Company under the Registration Statement which have not been waived by the holders of such rights or which have not expired by reason of lapse of time following notification of the Company's intention to file the Registration Statement.
In rendering such opinion, but without opining in connection therewith, such counsel also shall state that, although it expresses no view as to portions of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, or the Prospectus consisting of financial statements and other financial, accounting and statistical information and it has not independently verified, is not passing upon and assumes no responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (other than as stated in (v) above), it has no reason to believe that such remaining portions of the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto as of the time it became effective, as of the Initial Sale Time or as of the date of such opinion, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that, subject to the foregoing with respect to financial statements and other financial, accounting and statistical information, the Disclosure Package, taken as a whole, as of the Initial Sale Time, contained any  
 untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statement therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or that the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, as of its date or as of the date of such opinion contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of North Carolina, the United States, or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware to the extent deemed proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of counsel to the Underwriters, or upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing believed to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters; and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent deemed proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and its subsidiaries and public officials.
(c)        The Representative shall have received from Morrison & Foerster LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Initial Shares, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, and the Prospectus and any other related matters as the Representative may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
(d)        The Company shall have furnished to the Representative a certificate of the Company, signed by any Senior Vice President or Treasurer or any other authorized officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, and the Prospectus and this Agreement and they are without knowledge that:
(i)         the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are not true and correct with the same force and effect as though expressly made at and as of the Closing Date and the Company has not performed or complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to the Closing Date;
(ii)        any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued or any proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened by the Commission; and
(iii)       since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there has been any material adverse change or any development involving a prospective material adverse change in the condition (financial or other), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.  
 
(e)        At the time this Agreement is executed, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representative a letter or letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to one or more of the Representative), dated as of the date of this Agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representative, confirming that the response, if any, to Item 10 of the Registration Statement is correct insofar as it relates to them and stating in effect that:
(i)         They are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company within the meaning under the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
(ii)        In their opinion, the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries audited by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission.
(iii)       On the basis of procedures (but not an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) consisting of:
(a)        Reading the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, the board of directors, executive committee and audit committee of the Company and the boards of directors of the Principal Subsidiary Bank as set forth in the minute books through a specified date not more than five business days prior to the date of delivery of such letter;
(b)        Performing the procedures specified by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for a review of interim financial information as described in Statement of Accounting Standards No. 100, Interim Financial Information, on the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus, and the Prospectus and reading the unaudited interim financial data, if any, for the period from the date of the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus to the date of the latest available interim financial data; and
(c)        Making inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters regarding the specific items for which representations are requested below;
nothing has come to their attention as a result of the foregoing procedures that caused them to believe that:
(1)        the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus, do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act and the published rules and regulations thereunder;  
 
(2)        any material modifications should be made to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus, and the Prospectus, for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles;
(3)        (i) at the date of the latest available interim financial data and at the specified date not more than five business days prior to the date of the delivery of such letter, there was any change in the common stock and additional paid-in capital or the consolidated long-term debt (other than scheduled repayments of such debt) of the Company and the subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as compared with the amounts shown in the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus or (ii) for the period from the date of the latest available financial data to a specified date not more than five business days prior to the delivery of such letter, there was any change in the common stock and additional paid-in capital or the consolidated long-term debt (other than scheduled repayments of such debt) of the Company and the subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, except in all instances for changes or decreases which the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus, and the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur, or PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall state any specific changes or decreases.
(iv)       The letter shall also state that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has carried out certain other specified procedures, not constituting an audit, with respect to certain amounts, percentages and financial information which are included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus and which are specified by the Representative and agreed to by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, and has found such amounts, percentages and financial information to be in agreement with the relevant accounting, financial and other records of the Company and its subsidiaries identified in such letter.
In addition, on the Closing Date, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representative a letter or letters, dated the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representative, to the effect set forth in this paragraph (e).
(f)         Subsequent to the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (e) of this Section 5 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or other), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the judgment of the Representative, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Shares as contemplated by the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.  
 
(g)        Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representative such further information, certificates and documents as the Representative may reasonably request.
(h)        On or after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date, (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities.

(l)         There shall not have come to the Representative's attention any facts that would cause the Representative to believe that the Disclosure Package, as of the Initial Sale Time, or the Prospectus, at the time it was required to be delivered to a purchaser of the Depositary Shares, included any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances existing at the time of such delivery, not misleading.
If any of the conditions specified in this Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representative and their counsel, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representative.

7.         .

The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(a) shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Company may otherwise have.
(b)        Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (ii) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Base Prospectus, the preliminary prospectus, or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, and only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the preliminary prospectus, or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), in reliance upon and in conformity with the Underwriter Information; and to reimburse the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person for any legal and other expense reasonably incurred by the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage,  
 liability, expense or action.  The Company hereby acknowledges that the only information that the Underwriters have furnished to the Company expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) are the names of the Underwriters, the sentences relating to concessions and reallowances and the statements set forth in the seventh and eighth paragraphs, all under the caption "Underwriting" in the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus.  The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(b) shall be in addition to any liabilities that each Underwriter may otherwise have.
(c)        Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure to so notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any liability other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above.  In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties.  Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (other than local counsel approved by the Representative)), representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action) or (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
(d)        The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the  
 indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(e)        If the indemnification provided for in Sections 8(a) through (d) is for any reason unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Shares as set forth on such cover.  The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact or any such inaccurate or alleged inaccurate representation or warranty relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(c), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.  The provisions set forth in Section 8(c) with respect to notice of commencement of any action shall apply if a claim for contribution is to be made under this Section 8; , , that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given in accordance with Section 8(c) for purposes of indemnification.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 8(e).  
provided
however
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts received by such Underwriter in connection with the Shares underwritten by it.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) under the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(e) are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their names in Schedule II.  For purposes of this Section 8(e), each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.  Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (e), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, as contemplated by the preceding paragraph.  However, the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (e).
9.         .  If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Shares agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Shares set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bear to the aggregate amount of Shares set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Shares which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate amount of Shares which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Shares set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Shares, and if such non-defaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Shares, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company.  In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representative shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the preliminary prospectus, and the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

Termination
 settlement or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or material escalation of hostilities or other calamity or crisis (in the United States or elsewhere) the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representative, impracticable to market the Shares.
11.       .  The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Shares.

If and whenever dividends on the Series I Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series I Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(b)(i) have been conferred and are exercisable, have not been paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least six quarterly Dividend Periods (whether consecutive or not), the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two, and the holders of the Series I Preferred Stock (together with holders of any class of the Corporation's authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights, whether or not the holders of the such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist), shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to series, to the exclusion of the holders of common stock, to elect two directors of the Corporation to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that the election of such directors must not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall at no time include more than two such directors.  Each such director elected by the holders of shares of Series I Preferred Stock and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with the Series I Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and having equivalent voting rights is a "
            (i)         Voting Right. 
Preferred Director."
The election of the Preferred Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the holders of Series I Preferred Stock and any other class or series of our stock that ranks on parity with Series I Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and having equivalent voting rights and for which dividends have not been paid, called as provided herein.  At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(b)(i) above, the secretary of the Corporation may, and upon the written request of any holder of Series I Preferred Stock (addressed to the secretary at the Corporation's principal office) must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series I Preferred Stock and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series I Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and for which dividends have not been paid for the election of the two directors to be elected by them as provided in Section 7(b)(iii) below.  The Preferred Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter.                                                                                            6
(ii)        Election. 
 
  Notice for a special meeting will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Corporation's by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders.  If the secretary of the Corporation does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any holder of Series I Preferred Stock may (at our expense) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(b)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Corporation.  The Preferred Directors elected at any such special meeting will hold office until the next annual meeting of our stockholders unless they have been previously terminated or removed pursuant to Section 7(b)(iv).  In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by the vote of the holders of the Series I Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Corporation's authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights, whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders.
(iii)       Notice of Special Meeting.
  Whenever full dividends have been paid regularly on the Series I Preferred Stock and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series I Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, if any, for at least four quarterly Dividend Periods, then the right of the holders of Series I Preferred Stock to elect the Preferred Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods).  The terms of office of the Preferred Directors will immediately terminate, and the number of directors constituting the board of directors will be reduced accordingly.  Any Preferred Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series I Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Corporation's authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights, whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) when they have the voting rights described in this Section 7(b).
(iv)       Termination; Removal.
.  The holders of Series I Preferred Stock shall not have any rights of preemption or rights to convert such Series I Preferred Stock into shares of any other class of capital stock of the Corporation.
Section 8.        Preemption and Conversion
.  Notwithstanding anything set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designations to the contrary, the Board of Directors of the Corporation, the Committee or any authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, without the vote of the holders of the Series I Preferred Stock, may authorize and issue additional shares of Junior Stock, Parity Stock or any class or series of Senior Stock or any other securities ranking senior to the Series I Preferred Stock as to dividends and the distribution of assets upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.
Section 9.        Rank
.  Subject to the limitations imposed herein, the Corporation may purchase and sell Series I Preferred Stock from time to time to such extent, in such manner, and upon such terms as the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized                                                                                          7
Section 10.      Repurchase
 committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation may determine; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not use any of its funds for any such purchase when there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Corporation is, or by such purchase would be, rendered insolvent.
.  Shares of Series I Preferred Stock not issued or which have been issued and converted, redeemed or otherwise purchased or acquired by the Corporation shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock without designation as to series.
Section 11.      Unissued or Reacquired Shares
.  Shares of Series I Preferred Stock are not subject to the operation of a sinking fund.
Section 12.      No Sinking Fund
 
                                                                                 8

The Corporation hereby appoints Computershare and Trust Company, collectively, as depository for the Stock, and each of Computershare and Trust Company hereby accepts such appointment as depository for the Stock, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.  
Section 2.2.      Book-Entry System; Form and Transfer of Receipts. 
The Corporation and the Depository shall make application to The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") for acceptance of all of the Receipts for its book-entry settlement system. The Corporation hereby appoints the Depository acting through any authorized officer thereof as its attorney-in-fact, with full power to delegate, for purposes of executing any agreements, certifications or other instruments or documents necessary or desirable in order to effect the acceptance of such Receipts for DTC eligibility.  So long as the Receipts are eligible for book-entry settlement with DTC, unless otherwise required by law, all Depositary Shares to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange with book-entry settlement through DTC shall be represented by a single receipt (the "DTC Receipt"), which shall be deposited with DTC (or its designee) evidencing all such Depositary Shares and registered in the name of the nominee of DTC (initially expected to be Cede & Co.).  The Depository or such other entity as is agreed to by DTC may hold the DTC Receipt as custodian for DTC.  Ownership of beneficial interests in the                                                                                             2

If DTC subsequently ceases to make its book-entry settlement system available for the Receipts, the Corporation may instruct the Depository regarding making other arrangements for book-entry settlement.  If the Receipts are not eligible for book-entry form, the Depository shall provide written instructions to DTC to deliver the DTC Receipt to the Depository for cancellation and the Corporation shall instruct the Depository to deliver to the beneficial owners of the Depositary Shares previously evidenced by the DTC Receipt definitive Receipts in physical form evidencing such Depositary Shares.
Beneficial owners of Depositary Shares through DTC will not be entitled to receive Receipts in physical, certificated form or have Depositary Shares registered in their name, except in the event DTC ceases to make its book-entry settlement system available, as described in the preceding paragraph. 
Receipts shall be in denominations of any number of whole Depositary Shares. The Corporation shall deliver to the Depository from time to time such quantities of Receipts as the Depository may request to enable the Depository to perform its obligations under this Agreement.
The DTC Receipt and definitive Receipts, if any, shall be substantially in the form set forth in annexed to this Agreement and incorporated herein by reference, with appropriate insertions, modifications and omissions, as hereinafter provided and shall be engraved or otherwise prepared so as to comply with applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange Inc. or any other securities exchange on which the Depositary Shares are then listed.  In the event DTC ceases to make its book-entry system of settlement available and the Corporation and the Depository are unable to make other arrangements for book-entry settlement, the Depository, pending preparation of definitive Receipts and upon the written order of the Corporation, delivered in compliance with Section 2.3, shall execute and deliver temporary Receipts which may be printed, lithographed or otherwise substantially of the tenor of the definitive Receipts in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the persons executing such Receipts may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Receipts.  If temporary Receipts are issued, the Corporation and the Depository will cause definitive Receipts to be prepared without unreasonable delay.  After the preparation of definitive Receipts, the temporary Receipts shall be exchangeable by the Holder for definitive Receipts upon surrender of the temporary Receipts at an office described in the first paragraph of Section 2.3, without charge to the Holder.  Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Receipts, the Depository shall execute and deliver in exchange therefor definitive Receipts representing the same number of Depositary Shares as represented by the surrendered temporary Receipt or Receipts.  Such exchange shall be made at the Corporation's expense and without any charge therefor to the Holder or the Depository.  Until so exchanged, the temporary Receipts shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Agreement as definitive Receipts.                                                                                             3
Exhibit A
Receipts shall be executed by the Depository by the manual signature of a duly authorized officer of the Depository; provided, that such signature may be a facsimile if a Registrar for the Receipts (other than the Depository) shall have been appointed and such Receipts are countersigned by manual signature by a duly authorized officer of the Registrar.  No Receipt shall be entitled to any benefits under this Agreement or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless it shall have been executed manually by a duly authorized officer of the Depository or, if a Registrar for the Receipts (other than the Depository) shall have been appointed, by manual or facsimile signature of a duly authorized officer of the Depository and countersigned by manual signature by a duly authorized officer of such Registrar.  The Depository shall record on its books each Receipt so signed and delivered as hereinafter provided.
Receipts may be endorsed with, or have incorporated in the text thereof, such legends or recitals or changes not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement all as may be required by the Corporation or required to comply with any applicable law or any regulation thereunder or with the rules and regulations of any securities exchange upon which the Stock, the Depositary Shares or the Receipts may be listed or to conform with any usage with respect thereto, or to indicate any special limitations or restrictions to which any particular Receipts are subject.
Title to Depositary Shares evidenced by a Receipt which is properly endorsed, or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer, shall be transferable by delivery with the same effect as in the case of a negotiable instrument; provided, however, that until transfer of any particular Receipt shall be registered on the books of the Depository as provided in Section 2.4, the Depository may, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, treat the Record Holder thereof at such time as the absolute owner thereof for the purpose of determining the person entitled to distributions of dividends or other distributions or to any notice provided for in this Agreement and for all other purposes.
Section 2.3.      Deposit of Stock; Execution and Delivery of Receipts. 
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Corporation may from time to time deposit shares of Stock under this Agreement by delivery to the Depository of a certificate or certificates for such shares of Stock to be deposited, properly endorsed or accompanied, if required by the Depository, by a duly executed instrument of transfer or endorsement, in form satisfactory to the Depository, together with (i) all such certifications as may be required by the Depository in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, including the resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Corporation or a committee of the Board of Directors, as certified by the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the Corporation on the date thereof as being complete, accurate and in effect, relating to issuance and sale of the Stock, (ii) a letter of counsel to the Corporation authorizing reliance on such counsel's opinions delivered to the underwriters named therein relating to (A) the existence and good standing of the Corporation, (B) the due authorization of the Depositary Shares and the status of the Depositary Shares as validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and (C) the effectiveness of any registration statement under the Securities Act relating to the Depositary Shares, and (iii) a written order of the Corporation, directing the Depository to execute and deliver to, or upon the written order of, the person or persons stated in such order a Receipt or Receipts for the number of Depositary Shares                                                                                            4
 representing such deposited Stock. Deposited Stock shall be held by the Depository at the Depository's Office or at such other place or places as the Depository shall determine. 
Upon receipt by the Depository of a certificate or certificates for Stock deposited in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.3, together with the other documents required as above specified, and upon recordation of the Stock on the books of the Corporation (or its duly appointed transfer agent) in the name of the Depository or its nominee, the Depository, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, shall execute and deliver to, or upon the order of, the person or persons named in the written order delivered to the Depository referred to in the first paragraph of this Section 2.3, a Receipt or Receipts evidencing in the aggregate the number of Depositary Shares representing the Stock so deposited and registered in such name or names as may be requested by such person or persons.  The Depository shall execute and deliver such Receipt or Receipts at the Depository's Office or such other offices, if any, as the Depository may designate.  Delivery at other offices shall be at the risk and expense of the person requesting such delivery.
Section 2.4.      Registration of Transfer of Receipts. 
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Depository shall register on its books from time to time transfers of Receipts upon any surrender thereof by the Holder in person or by duly authorized attorney, properly endorsed or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer, including a guarantee of the signature thereon by a participant in a signature guarantee medallion program approved by the Securities Transfer Association, Inc. (the "Signature Guarantee").  Thereupon, the Depository shall execute a new Receipt or Receipts evidencing the same aggregate number of Depositary Shares as those evidenced by the Receipt or Receipts surrendered and deliver such new Receipt or Receipts to or upon the order of the person entitled thereto.
Section 2.5.      Split-ups and Combinations of Receipts; Surrender of Receipts and  Withdrawal of Stock. 
Upon surrender of a Receipt or Receipts at the Depository's Office or at such other offices as it may designate for the purpose of effecting a split-up or combination of such Receipt or Receipts, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Depository shall execute a new Receipt or Receipts in the authorized denomination or denominations requested, evidencing the aggregate number of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipt or Receipts surrendered, and shall deliver such new Receipt or Receipts to or upon the order of the Holder of the Receipt or Receipts so surrendered.
In the event DTC ceases to make its book-entry system of settlement available, and the Corporation and the Depository are unable to make other arrangements for book-entry settlement and definitive Receipts have been issued, as further described in Section 2.2, any Holder of a Receipt or Receipts may withdraw the number of whole shares of Stock and all money represented thereby by surrendering such Receipt or Depositary Shares represented by the Receipts at the Depository's Office or at such other offices as the Depository may designate for such withdrawals.  Thereafter, without unreasonable delay, the Depository shall deliver to such Holder, or to the person or persons designated by such Holder as hereinafter provided, the                                                                                      5
 number of whole shares of Stock and all money represented by the Receipt or Receipts, or Depositary Shares represented by such Receipt or Receipts, so surrendered for withdrawal, but Holders of such whole shares of Stock will not thereafter be entitled to deposit such Stock hereunder or to receive a Receipt evidencing Depositary Shares therefor.  If a Receipt delivered by the Holder to the Depository in connection with such withdrawal shall evidence a number of Depositary Shares in excess of the number of Depositary Shares representing the number of whole shares of Stock to be withdrawn, the Depository shall at the same time, in addition to such number of whole shares of Stock and such money to be so withdrawn, deliver to such Holder, or subject to Section 2.4 upon his order, a new Receipt evidencing such excess number of Depositary Shares; provided, however, that the Depository shall not issue any Receipt evidencing a fractional Depositary Share.
Delivery of the Stock and money being withdrawn may be made by the delivery of such certificates, documents of title and other instruments as the Depository may deem appropriate, which, if required by the Depository, shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer including, but not limited to, a Signature Guarantee.
If the Stock and the money being withdrawn are to be delivered to a person or persons other than the Record Holder of the related Receipt or Receipts being surrendered for withdrawal of such Stock, such Holder shall execute and deliver to the Depository a written order so directing the Depository, and the Depository may require that the Receipt or Receipts surrendered by such Holder for withdrawal of such shares of Stock be properly endorsed in blank or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer in blank.
Delivery of the Stock and the money represented by Receipts surrendered for withdrawal shall be made by the Depository at the Depository's Office, except that, at the request, risk and expense of the Holder surrendering such Receipt or Receipts and for the account of the Holder thereof, such delivery may be made at such other place as may be designated by such Holder.
Section 2.6.      Limitations on Execution and Delivery, Transfer, Surrender and Exchange of Receipts. 
As a condition precedent to the execution and delivery, registration of transfer, split-up, combination, surrender or exchange of any Receipt, the Depository, any of the Depository's Agents or the Corporation may require payment to it of a sum sufficient for the payment (or, in the event that the Depository or the Corporation shall have made such payment, the reimbursement to it) of any charges or expenses payable by the Holder of a Receipt pursuant to Sections 3.2 and 5.7, may require the production of evidence satisfactory to it as to the identity and genuineness of any signature, including a Signature Guarantee, and may also require compliance with such regulations, if any, as the Depository or the Corporation may establish consistent with the provisions of this Agreement and applicable law.
The deposit of the Stock may be refused, the delivery of Receipts against Stock may be suspended, the registration of transfer of Receipts may be refused and the registration of transfer, surrender or exchange of outstanding Receipts may be suspended (i) during any period when the register of stockholders of the Corporation is closed or (ii) if any such action is deemed necessary or advisable by the Depository, any of the Depository's Agents or the Corporation at                                                                                    6
 any time or from time to time because of any requirement of law or of any government or governmental body or commission or under any provision of this Agreement.
Section 2.7.      Lost Receipts, etc. 
In case any Receipt shall be mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen, the Depository in its discretion may execute and deliver a Receipt of like form and tenor in exchange and substitution for such mutilated Receipt upon cancellation thereof, or in lieu of and in substitution for such destroyed, lost or stolen Receipt, upon (i) the filing by the Holder thereof with the Depository of evidence satisfactory to the Depository of such destruction or loss or theft of such Receipt, of the authenticity thereof and of his or her ownership thereof; (ii) the Holder thereof furnishing of the Depository with reasonable indemnification satisfactory to the Depository and the provision of an open penalty surety bond satisfactory to the Depository and holding it and the Corporation harmless; and (iii) the payment of any reasonable expense (including reasonable fees, charges and expenses of the Depository) in connection with such execution and delivery.
Section 2.8.      Cancellation and Destruction of Surrendered Receipts. 
All Receipts surrendered to the Depository or any Depository's Agent shall be cancelled by the Depository.  Except as prohibited by applicable law or regulation, the Depository is authorized and directed to destroy all Receipts so cancelled.
Section 2.9.      Redemption of Stock. 
Whenever the Corporation shall be permitted and shall elect to redeem shares of Stock in accordance with the terms of the Certificate, it shall (unless otherwise agreed to in writing with the Depository) give or cause to be given to the Depository, not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date (as defined below), notice of the date of such proposed redemption of Stock and of the number of such shares held by the Depository to be so redeemed and the applicable redemption price, which notice shall be accompanied by a certificate from the Corporation stating that such redemption of Stock is in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate.  On the Redemption Date, provided that the Corporation shall then have paid or caused to be paid in full to the Depository the redemption price of the Stock to be redeemed, plus an amount equal to any declared and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption, in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate, the Depository shall redeem the number of Depositary Shares representing such Stock.  The Depository shall mail notice of the Corporation's redemption of Stock and the proposed simultaneous redemption of the number of Depositary Shares representing the Stock to be redeemed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption of such Stock and Depositary Shares (the "Redemption Date"), to the Record Holders of the Receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares to be so redeemed at their respective last addresses as they appear on the records of the Depository; but neither failure to mail any notice of redemption of Depositary Shares to one or more Holders nor any defect in any notice of redemption of Depositary Shares to one or more Holders shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for redemption as to the other Holders.  Each notice shall be prepared by the Corporation and shall state: (i) the Redemption Date; (ii) the number of Depositary Shares to be redeemed and, if less than all the Depositary Shares held by any Holder are to be redeemed, the number of Depositary                                                                                   7
 Shares held by such Holder to be so redeemed; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends in respect of the Stock represented by the Depositary Shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such Redemption Date.  In case less than all the outstanding Depositary Shares are to be redeemed, the Depositary Shares to be so redeemed shall be selected either pro rata or by lot or in such other manner as the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of, or appointed by, the Board of Directors of the Corporation may determine to be fair and equitable.
Notice having been mailed by the Depository as aforesaid, from and after the Redemption Date (unless the Corporation shall have failed to provide the funds necessary to redeem the Stock evidenced by the Depositary Shares called for redemption) (i) dividends on the shares of Stock so called for Redemption shall cease to accrue from and after such date, (ii) the Depositary Shares being redeemed from such proceeds shall be deemed no longer to be outstanding, (iii) all rights of the Holders of Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares (except the right to receive the redemption price) shall, to the extent of such Depositary Shares, cease and terminate, and (iv) upon surrender in accordance with such redemption notice of the Receipts evidencing any such Depositary Shares called for redemption (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Depository or applicable law shall so require), such Depositary Shares shall be redeemed by the Depository at a redemption price per Depositary Share equal to one one-thousandth of the redemption price per share of Stock so redeemed plus all money represented by such Depositary Shares, including all amounts paid by the Corporation in respect of dividends which on the Redemption Date have been declared on the shares of Stock to be so redeemed and have not theretofore been paid.
If fewer than all of the Depositary Shares evidenced by a Receipt are called for redemption, the Depository will deliver to the Holder of such Receipt upon its surrender to the Depository, together with the redemption payment, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares evidenced by such prior Receipt and not called for redemption; provided, however, that the Depository shall not issue any Receipt evidencing a fractional Depositary Share.
The Depository shall, to the extent permitted by law, release or repay to the Corporation any funds deposited by or for the account of the Corporation for the purpose of redeeming any Depositary Shares that remain unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date, without further action necessary on the part of the Corporation.
Section 3.1.      Filing Proofs; Certificates and Other Information. 
Any Holder of a Receipt may be required from time to time to file proof of residence, or other matters or other information, to execute certificates and to make such representations and warranties as the Depository or the Corporation may reasonably deem necessary or proper.  The Depository or the Corporation may withhold the delivery, or delay the registration of transfer or redemption, of any Receipt or the withdrawal of the Stock represented by the Depositary Shares                                                                                         8
 and evidenced by a Receipt or the distribution of any dividend or other distribution or the sale of any rights or of the proceeds thereof until such proof or other information is filed or such certificates are executed or such representations and warranties are made.
Section 3.2.      Payment of Taxes or Other Governmental Charges. 
Holders of Receipts shall be obligated to make payments to the Depository of certain charges and expenses, as provided in Section 5.7.  Registration of transfer of any Receipt or any withdrawal of Stock and all money represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt may be refused until any such payment due is made, and any dividends, interest payments or other distributions may be withheld or any part of or all the Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt and not theretofore sold may be sold for the account of the Holder thereof (after attempting by reasonable means to notify such Holder prior to such sale), and such dividends, interest payments or other distributions or the proceeds of any such sale may be applied to any payment of such charges or expenses, the Holder of such Receipt remaining liable for any deficiency.
Section 3.3.      Warranty as to Stock. 
The Corporation hereby represents and warrants that the Stock, when issued, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.  Such representation and warranty shall survive the deposit of the Stock and the issuance of the related Receipts.
Section 3.4.      Warranty as to Receipts. 
The Corporation hereby represents and warrants that the Receipts, when issued, will represent legal and valid interests in the Stock.  Such representation and warranty shall survive the deposit of the Stock and the issuance of the Receipts.
Section 4.1.      Cash Distributions. 
Whenever Computershare, as distribution agent, shall receive any cash dividend or other cash distribution on the Stock, Computershare shall, subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, distribute to Record Holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.4 such amounts of such dividend or distribution as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such Holders; provided, however, that in case the Corporation or Computershare shall be required to withhold, and shall withhold, from any cash dividend or other cash distribution in respect of the Stock an amount on account of taxes, the amount made available for distribution or distributed in respect of Depositary Shares shall be reduced accordingly.  In the event that the calculation of any such cash dividend or other cash distribution to be paid to any Record Holder on the aggregate number of Depositary Shares held by such Record Holder results in an amount that is a fraction of a cent and that fraction of a cent is equal to or greater than $0.005, the amount Computershare shall distribute to such record holder shall be rounded up to the next highest whole cent; otherwise, such fractional amount shall be disregarded by the Depository; provided, however,                                                                                      9
 upon the Depository's request, the Corporation shall pay the additional amount to the Depository for distribution.
Each Holder of a Receipt shall provide Computershare with its certified tax identification number on a properly completed Form W-8 or W-9, as may be applicable.  Each Holder of a Receipt acknowledges that, in the event of non-compliance with the preceding sentence, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, may require withholding by Computershare of a portion of any of the distributions to be made hereunder.
Section 4.2.      Distributions Other than Cash, Rights, Preferences or Privileges. 
Whenever Computershare shall receive any distribution other than cash, rights, preferences or privileges upon the Stock, Computershare shall, subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, distribute to Record Holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.4 such amounts of the securities or property received by it as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipts held by such Holders, in any manner that Computershare may deem equitable and practicable for accomplishing such distribution.  If in the opinion of Computershare such distribution cannot be made proportionately among such Record Holders, or if for any other reason (including any requirement that the Corporation or Computershare withhold an amount on account of taxes or governmental charges) Computershare deems, after consultation with the Corporation, such distribution not to be feasible, Computershare may, with the approval of the Corporation, adopt such method as it deems equitable and practicable for the purpose of effecting such distribution, including the sale (at public or private sale) of the securities or property thus received, or any part thereof, in a commercially reasonable manner.  The net proceeds of any such sale shall, subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, be distributed or made available for distribution, as the case may be, by Computershare to Record Holders of Receipts as provided by Section 4.1 in the case of a distribution received in cash.  The Corporation shall not make any distribution of such securities or property to Computershare, and Computershare shall not make any distribution of such securities or property to the Holders of Receipts, unless the Corporation shall have provided an opinion of counsel stating that such securities or property have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered in connection with such distributions.
Section 4.3.      Subscription Rights, Preferences or Privileges. 
If the Corporation shall at any time offer or cause to be offered to the persons in whose names the Stock is recorded on the books of the Corporation any rights, preferences or privileges to subscribe for or to purchase any securities or any rights, preferences or privileges of any other nature, such rights, preferences or privileges shall in each such instance be communicated to the Depository and thereafter made available by the Depository to the Record Holders of Receipts in such manner as the Depository may determine, either by the issue to such Record Holders of warrants representing such rights, preferences or privileges or by such other method as may be approved by the Depository in its discretion with the approval of the Corporation; provided, however, that (i) if at the time of issue or offer of any such rights, preferences or privileges the Depository determines that it is not lawful or (after consultation with the Corporation) not feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges available to Holders of Receipts by the issue of warrants or otherwise, or (ii) if and to the extent so instructed by Holders of Receipts                                                                                      10
 who do not desire to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges, then Computershare, in its discretion (with approval of the Corporation, in any case where the Depository has determined that it is not feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges available), may, if applicable laws or the terms of such rights, preferences or privileges permit such transfer, sell such rights, preferences or privileges at public or private sale, at such place or places and upon such terms as it may deem proper.  The net proceeds of any such sale shall, subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, be distributed by Computershare to the Record Holders of Receipts entitled thereto as provided by Section 4.1 in the case of a distribution received in cash.
The Corporation shall notify the Depository whether registration under the Securities Act of the securities to which any rights, preferences or privileges relate is required in order for Holders of Receipts to be offered or sold the securities to which such rights, preferences or privileges relate, and the Corporation agrees with the Depository that it will file promptly a registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act with respect to such rights, preferences or privileges and securities and use its best efforts and take all steps available to it to cause such registration statement to become effective sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such Holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges.  In no event shall the Depository make available to the Holders of Receipts any right, preference or privilege to subscribe for or to purchase any securities unless and until such registration statement shall have become effective, or the Corporation shall have provided to the Depository an opinion of counsel to the effect that the offering and sale of such securities to the Holders are exempt from registration under the provisions of the Securities Act.
The Corporation shall notify the Depository whether any other action under the laws of any jurisdiction or any governmental or administrative authorization, consent or permit is required in order for such rights, preferences or privileges to be made available to Holders of Receipts, and the Corporation agrees with the Depository that the Corporation will use its reasonable best efforts to take such action or obtain such authorization, consent or permit sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such Holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges.
Section 4.4.      Notice of Dividends, etc.; Fixing Record Date for Holders of Receipts. 
Whenever any cash dividend or other cash distribution shall become payable or any distribution other than cash shall be made, or if rights, preferences or privileges shall at any time be offered, with respect to the Stock, or whenever the Depository shall receive notice of any meeting at which holders of the Stock are entitled to vote or of which holders of the Stock are entitled to notice, or whenever the Depository and the Corporation shall decide it is appropriate, the Depository shall in each such instance fix a record date (which shall be the same date as the record date fixed by the Corporation with respect to or otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Stock) for the determination of the Holders of Receipts who shall be entitled to receive such dividend, distribution, rights, preferences or privileges or the net proceeds of the sale thereof, or to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at any such meeting, or who shall be entitled to notice of such meeting or for any other appropriate reasons.                                                                                 11
 
Section 4.5.      Voting Rights. 
Subject to the provisions of the Certificate, upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of the Stock are entitled to vote, the Depository shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the Record Holders of Receipts, determined on the record date as set forth in Section 4.4, a notice prepared by the Corporation which shall contain (i) such information as is contained in such notice of meeting and (ii) a statement that the Holders may, subject to any applicable restrictions, instruct the Depository as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the amount of Stock represented by their respective Depositary Shares (including an express indication that instructions may be given to the Depository to give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by the Corporation) and a brief statement as to the manner in which such instructions may be given.  Upon the written request of the Holders of Receipts on the relevant record date, the Depository shall endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such requests, the maximum number of whole shares of Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by all Receipts as to which any particular voting instructions are received.  The Corporation hereby agrees to take all reasonable action which may be deemed necessary by the Depository in order to enable the Depository to vote such Stock or cause such Stock to be voted.  In the absence of specific instructions from Holders of Receipts, the Depository will vote the Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts of such Holders proportionately with votes cast pursuant to instructions received from the other Holders.
Section 4.6.      Changes Affecting Deposited Securities and Reclassifications, Recapitalizations, etc. 
Upon any change in par or stated value, split-up, combination or any other reclassification of the Stock, subject to the provisions of the Certificate, or upon any recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation affecting the Corporation or to which it is a party, the Depository may in its discretion with the approval of, and shall upon the instructions of, the Corporation, and (in either case) in such manner as the Depository may deem equitable, (i) make such adjustments as are certified by the Corporation in the fraction of an interest represented by one Depositary Share in one share of Stock and in the ratio of the redemption price per Depositary Share to the redemption price per share of Stock, in each case as may be necessary fully to reflect the effects of such change in par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of the Stock, or of such recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation and (ii) treat any securities which shall be received by the Depository in exchange for or upon conversion of or in respect of the Stock as new deposited securities so received in exchange for or upon conversion or in respect of such Stock.  In any such case the Corporation may in its discretion direct the Depository to execute and deliver additional Receipts or may call for the surrender of all outstanding Receipts to be exchanged for new Receipts specifically describing such new deposited securities.  Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, Holders of Receipts shall have the right from and after the effective date of any such change in par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of the Stock or any such recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation to surrender such Receipts to the Depository with instructions to convert, exchange or surrender the Stock represented thereby only into or for, as the case may be, the kind and amount of shares and other securities and property and cash into which the Stock represented by such Receipts might have been converted                                                                                            12
 or for which such Stock might have been exchanged or surrendered immediately prior to the effective date of such transaction.
Section 4.7.      Delivery of Reports. 
The Depository shall furnish to Holders of Receipts any reports and communications received from the Corporation which are received by the Depository, as the holder of the Stock, and which the Corporation is required to furnish to the holders of the Stock.
Section 4.8.      Lists of Receipt Holders. 
Reasonably promptly upon request from time to time by the Corporation, at the sole expense of the Corporation, the Depository shall furnish to it a list, as of the most recent practicable date, of the names, addresses and holdings of Depositary Shares of all registered Holders of Receipts.
Section 5.1.      Maintenance of Offices, Agencies and Transfer Books by the Depository; Registrar; Depository's Agents. 
Upon execution of this Agreement, the Depository shall maintain at the Depository's Office, facilities for the execution and delivery, registration and registration of transfer, surrender and exchange of Receipts, and at the offices of the Depository's Agents, if any, facilities for the delivery, registration of transfer, surrender and exchange of Receipts, all in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; provided that, to the extent provisions of this Agreement regarding transfer or registration functions performed by the Depository conflict with the terms of any transfer agency agreement between the Corporation and the Depository, the terms of such transfer agency agreement shall control.
The Depository shall keep books at the Depository's Office for the registration and transfer of Receipts.  Upon direction by the Corporation and with reasonable notice to the Depository, the Depository shall open its books for inspection by the Record Holders of Receipts as directed by the Corporation; provided that any Holder shall be granted such right by the Corporation only after certifying that such inspection shall be for a proper purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as an owner of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts.
The Depository may close such books, at any time or from time to time, when deemed expedient by it in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder.
The Depository may, with the approval of the Corporation, appoint a Registrar for registration of the Receipts or the Depositary Shares evidenced thereby.  If the Receipts or the Depositary Shares evidenced thereby or the Stock represented by such Depositary Shares shall be listed on one or more national securities exchanges, the Depository will appoint a Registrar (acceptable to the Corporation) for registration of the Receipts or Depositary Shares in accordance with any requirements of such exchange.  Such Registrar (which may be the                                                                                 13
 Depository if so permitted by the requirements of any such exchange) may be removed and a substitute registrar appointed by the Depository upon the request or with the approval of the Corporation.  If the Receipts, Depositary Shares or Stock are listed on one or more other securities exchanges, the Depository will, at the request of the Corporation, arrange such facilities for the delivery, registration, registration of transfer, surrender and exchange of the Receipts, Depositary Shares or Stock as may be required by law or applicable securities exchange regulation.
The Depository may from time to time appoint Depository's Agents to act in any respect for the Depository for the purposes of this Agreement and may from time to time appoint additional Depository's Agents and vary or terminate the appointment of such Depository's Agents, provided that the Depository will notify the Corporation of any such appointment or variation or termination of such appointment.
Section 5.2.      Prevention of or Delay in Performance by the Depository, the Depository's Agents, the Registrar or the Corporation. 
Neither the Depository nor any Depository's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Corporation shall incur any liability to any Holder of a Receipt if by reason of any provision of any present or future law, or regulation thereunder, of the United States of America or of any other governmental authority or, in the case of the Depository, the Depository's Agent or the Registrar, by reason of any provision, present or future, of the Corporation's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including the Certificate) or by reason of any act of God or war or other circumstance beyond the control of the relevant party, the Depository, the Depository's Agent, the Registrar or the Corporation shall be prevented, delayed or forbidden from, or subjected to any penalty on account of, doing or performing any act or thing which the terms of this Agreement provide shall be done or performed.  Nor shall the Depository, any Depository's Agent, any Registrar or the Corporation incur liability to any Holder of a Receipt (i) by reason of any nonperformance or delay, caused as aforesaid, in the performance of any act or thing which the terms of this Agreement shall provide shall or may be done or performed, or (ii) by reason of any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any discretion provided for in this Agreement except, in case of any such exercise or failure to exercise discretion not caused as aforesaid, if cause by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party chares with such exercise or failure to exercise, or as otherwise explicitly set forth in this Agreement.
Section 5.3.      Obligations of the Depository, the Depository's Agents, the Registrar and the Corporation. 
Neither the Depository nor any Depository's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Corporation assumes any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under this Agreement to Holders of Receipts other than for its gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. 
Neither the Depository nor any Depository's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Corporation shall be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any action, suit or other proceeding in respect of the Stock, the Depositary Shares or the Receipts, which, in its opinion, may involve it in expense or liability, unless indemnity satisfactory to it against all expense and liability be furnished as often as may be reasonably required.                                                                                            14
 
Neither the Depository nor any Depository's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Corporation shall be liable for any action or any failure to act by it in reliance upon the written advice of legal counsel or accountants, or information from any person presenting Stock for deposit, any Holder of a Receipt or any other person believed by it in good faith to be competent to give such information.  The Depository, any Depository's Agent, any Registrar and the Corporation may each rely, and shall each be protected in acting upon or omitting to act upon any written notice, request, direction or other document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
The Depository shall indemnify the Corporation against any liability which may directly arise out of acts performed or omitted by the Depository or any Depository's Agent due to its or their gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith.
The Depository shall not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instruction to vote any of the shares of Stock or for the manner or effect of any such vote made, as long as any such action or inaction is not taken in bad faith.  The Depository undertakes, and any Registrar shall be required to undertake, to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Depository or any Registrar.
The Depository, its parent, affiliates or subsidiaries, the Depository's Agents and the Registrar may own, buy, sell and deal in any class of securities of the Corporation and its affiliates and in Receipts or Depositary Shares or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Corporation or its affiliates may be interested or contract with or lend money to any such person or otherwise act as fully or as freely as if it were not the Depository, the parent, affiliate or subsidiary or the Depository's Agent or the Registrar hereunder.  The Depository may also act as trustee, transfer agent or registrar of any of the securities of the Corporation and its affiliates.
It is intended that neither the Depository nor any Depository's Agent nor the Registrar, acting as the Depository's Agent or Registrar, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be an "issuer" of the securities under the federal securities laws or applicable state securities laws, it being expressly understood and agreed that the Depository, any Depository's Agent and the Registrar are acting only in a ministerial capacity as Depository or Registrar for the Stock.
Neither the Depository (or its officers, directors, employees or agents) nor any Depository's Agent nor the Registrar makes any representation or has any responsibility as to the validity of the registration statement pursuant to which the Depositary Shares are registered under the Securities Act, the Stock, the Depositary Shares or the Receipts (except for its counter-signatures thereon) or any instruments referred to therein or herein, or as to the correctness of any statement made therein or herein.
The Depository assumes no responsibility for the correctness of the description that appears in the Receipts. Notwithstanding any other provision herein or in the Receipts, the Depository makes no warranties or representations as to the validity or genuineness of any Stock at any time deposited with the Depository hereunder or of the Depositary Shares, as to the validity or sufficiency of this Agreement, as to the value of the Depositary Shares or as to any                                                                                         15
 right, title or interest of the record holders of Receipts in and to the Depositary Shares. The Depository shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Corporation of the Depositary Shares or the Receipts or the proceeds thereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no party to this Agreement shall be liable for any incidental, indirect, special or consequential damages of any nature whatsoever, including, but not limited to, loss of anticipated profits, occasioned by breach of any provision of this Agreement even if apprised of the possibility of such damages.
The Depository shall not be under any liability for interest on any monies at any time received by it pursuant to any of the provisions of this Agreement or of the Receipts, the Depositary Shares or the Stock nor shall it be obligated to segregate such monies from other monies held by it, except as required by law.  The Depository shall not be responsible for advancing funds on behalf of the Corporation and shall have no duty or obligation to make any payments if it has not timely received sufficient funds to make timely payments.
In the event the Depository believes any ambiguity or uncertainty exists hereunder or in any notice, instruction, direction, request or other communication, paper or document received by the Depository hereunder, or in the administration of any of the provisions of this Agreement, the Depository shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, omitting or suffering to take any action hereunder, the Depository may, in its sole discretion upon written notice to the Corporation, refrain from taking any action and shall be fully protected and shall not be liable in any way to the Corporation, any Holders of Receipts or any other person or entity for refraining from taking such action, unless the Depository receives written instructions or a certificate signed by the Corporation which eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction of the Depository or which proves or establishes the applicable matter to the satisfaction of the Depository.
The Depository undertakes not to issue any Receipt other than to evidence the Depositary Shares that have been delivered to and are then on deposit with the Depository.  The Depository also undertakes not to sell, except as provided herein, pledge or lend Depositary Shares by it as Depository.
Section 5.4.      Resignation and Removal of the Depository; Appointment of Successor Depository. 
The Depository may at any time resign as Depository hereunder by delivering notice of its election to do so to the Corporation, such resignation to take effect upon the appointment of a successor Depository and its acceptance of such appointment as hereinafter provided.
The Depository may at any time be removed by the Corporation by notice of such removal delivered to the Depository, such removal to take effect upon the appointment of a successor Depository hereunder and its acceptance of such appointment as hereinafter provided.
In case at any time the Depository acting hereunder shall resign or be removed, the Corporation shall, within 60 days after the delivery of the notice of resignation or removal, as the case may be, appoint a successor Depository, which shall be a bank or trust company having its principal office in the United States of America and having a combined capital and surplus of at                                                                                    16
 least $50,000,000.  If no successor Depository shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment within 60 days after delivery of such notice, the resigning or removed Depository may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Depository.  Every successor Depository shall execute and deliver to its predecessor and to the Corporation an instrument in writing accepting its appointment hereunder, and thereupon such successor Depository, without any further act or deed, shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor and for all purposes shall be the Depository under this Agreement, and such predecessor, upon payment of all sums due it and on the written request of the Corporation, shall promptly execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor all rights and powers of such predecessor hereunder, shall duly assign, transfer and deliver all right, title and interest in the Stock and any moneys held hereunder to such successor, and shall deliver to such successor a list of the Record Holders of all outstanding Receipts and such records, books and other information in its possession relating thereto.  Any successor Depository shall promptly mail notice of its appointment to the Record Holders of Receipts.
Any entity into or with which the Depository may be merged, consolidated or converted shall be the successor of the Depository without the execution or filing of any document or any further act, and notice thereof shall not be required hereunder.  Such successor Depository may authenticate the Receipts in the name of the predecessor Depository or its own name as successor Depository.
Section 5.5.      Corporate Notices and Reports. 
The Corporation agrees that it will deliver to the Depository, and the Depository will, promptly after receipt thereof, transmit to the Record Holders of Receipts, in each case at the addresses recorded in the Depository's books, copies of all notices and reports (including without limitation financial statements) required by law, by the rules of any national securities exchange upon which the Stock, the Depositary Shares or the Receipts are listed or by the Corporation's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including the Certificate), to be furnished to the Record Holders of Receipts.  Such transmission will be at the Corporation's expense and the Corporation will provide the Depository with such number of copies of such documents as the Depository may reasonably request.  In addition, the Depository will transmit to the Record Holders of Receipts at the Corporation's expense, including applicable fees, such other documents as may be requested by the Corporation.
Section 5.6.      Indemnification by the Corporation. 
Subject to Section 5.3, the Corporation shall indemnify the Depository, any Depository's Agent and any Registrar (including each of their officers, directors, agents and employees) against, and hold each of them harmless from, any loss, damage, cost, penalty, liability or expense (including the reasonable costs and expenses of defending itself) which may arise out of acts performed, suffered or omitted to be taken in connection with this Agreement and the Receipts by the Depository, any Registrar or any of their respective agents (including any Depository's Agent) and any transactions or documents contemplated hereby, except for any liability arising out of negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on the respective parts of any such person or persons.  The obligations of the Corporation set forth in this Section 5.6 shall survive any succession of any Depository, Registrar or Depository's Agent.                                                                                      17
 
Section 5.7.      Fees, Charges and Expenses. 
The Corporation agrees promptly to pay the Depository the compensation to be agreed upon with the Corporation for all services rendered by the Depository hereunder and to reimburse the Depository for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Depository without negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on its part (or on the part of any agent or Depository's Agent) in connection with the services rendered by it (or such agent or Depository's Agent) hereunder.  The Corporation shall pay all charges of the Depository in connection with the initial deposit of the Stock and the initial issuance of the Depositary Shares and any redemption or exchange of the Stock at the option of the Corporation.  The Corporation shall pay all transfer and other taxes and governmental charges arising solely from the existence of the depository arrangements.  All other transfer and other taxes and governmental charges shall be at the expense of Holders of Depositary Shares evidenced by Receipts.  If, at the request of a Holder of Receipts, the Depository incurs charges or expenses for which the Corporation is not otherwise liable hereunder, such Holder will be liable for such charges and expenses; provided, however, that the Depository may, at its sole option, request that the Corporation direct a Holder of a Receipt to prepay the Depository any charge or expense the Depository has been asked to incur at the request of such Holder of Receipts.  The Depository shall present its statement for charges and expenses to the Corporation at such intervals as the Corporation and the Depository may agree.
Section 5.8.      Tax Compliance. 
Computershare and, where applicable, the Trust Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Corporation, will comply with all applicable certification, information reporting and withholding (including "backup" withholding) requirements imposed by applicable tax laws, regulations or administrative practice with respect to (i) any payments made with respect to the Depositary Shares or (ii) the issuance, delivery, holding, transfer, redemption or exercise of rights under the Depositary Receipts or the Depositary Shares.  Such compliance shall include, without limitation, the preparation and timely filing of required returns and the timely payment of all amounts required to be withheld to the appropriate taxing authority or its designated agent.
The Depository shall comply with any direction received from the Corporation with respect to the application of such requirements to particular payments or holders or in other particular circumstances, and may for purposes of this Agreement rely on any such direction in accordance with the provisions of section 5.3 hereof.
The Depository shall maintain all appropriate records documenting compliance with such requirements, and shall make such records available on request to the Corporation or to its authorized representatives.
Section 6.1.      Amendment. 
The form of the Receipts and any provisions of this Agreement may at any time and from time to time be amended by agreement between the Corporation and the Depository in any                                                                                            18
 respect which they may deem necessary or desirable; provided, however, that the no such amendment (other than a change in fees) which shall materially and adversely alter the rights of the Holders of Receipts shall be effective unless such amendment shall have been approved by the holders of at least a majority of the Depositary Shares then outstanding.  Every Holder of an outstanding receipt at the time any such amendment becomes effective shall be deemed, by continuing to hold such Receipt, to consent and agree to such amendment and to be bound by this Agreement. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Corporation be required to execute any amendment which may impair the right, subject to the provisions of Sections 2.6 and 2.7 and Article III, of any owner of Depositary Shares to surrender any Receipt evidencing such Depositary Shares to the Depository with instructions to deliver to the Holder the Stock and all money represented thereby, except in order to comply with mandatory provisions of applicable law or the rules and regulations of any governmental body, agency or commission, or applicable securities exchange.
Section 6.2.      Termination. 
This Agreement may be terminated by the Corporation or the Depository only if (i) all outstanding Depositary Shares issued hereunder have been redeemed pursuant to Section 2.9, or (ii) there shall have been made a final distribution in respect of the Stock in connection with any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation and such distribution shall have been distributed to the Holders of Receipts representing Depositary Shares pursuant to Section 4.1 or 4.2, as applicable.

th
Ladies and Gentlemen: 
We have acted as counsel to Bank of America Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), in connection with (i) the issuance of up to 25,300,000 depositary shares (the "Depositary Shares"), each representing a 1/1000 interest in a share of Bank of America Corporation 6.625% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series I (the "Preferred Stock"), pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated September 20, 2007 among the Corporation and the Underwriters named therein (the "Underwriting Agreement") and  (ii) the Registration Statement on Form S3, Registration No. 333133852 (the "Registration Statement"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), with respect to the Corporation's unsecured debt securities, units, warrants, preferred stock, depositary shares and common stock, and the Prospectus dated May 5, 2006, constituting a part of the Registration Statement, as supplemented by the Final Prospectus Supplement dated September 20, 2007, filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, relating to the Depositary Shares.
th
As such counsel, we have examined and are familiar with such original or photocopies or certified copies of such records of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, certificates of officers of the Corporation and of public officials and such other documents as we have deemed relevant or necessary as the basis for the opinion set forth below.  In such examinations, we have assumed the legal capacity of natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures on, and the authenticity of, all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified copies or photocopies and the authenticity of the originals of such copies.  We have also relied upon statements of fact contained in documents that we have examined in connection with our representation of the Corporation.
Based solely upon the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, and subject to the limitations, qualifications and exceptions set forth below, we are of the opinion that (i) the shares of Preferred Stock have been duly authorized and, when paid for as contemplated in the Underwriting Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable; and (ii) the Depositary Shares have been duly and validly authorized for issuance and sale, and, when those Depositary Shares are issued and delivered against payment therefor pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Depositary Shares will be duly and validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable and will represent valid interests in the Preferred Stock.
We hereby consent to be named in the Registration Statement as attorneys who passed upon the legality of the Preferred Stock and the Depositary Shares and to the filing of a copy of this opinion as part of the Corporation's Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed for the purpose of including this opinion as part of the Registration Statement.
Very truly yours,
