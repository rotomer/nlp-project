CHARLOTTE  Bank of America Corporation today reported third quarter net income declined 32 percent to $3.70 billion from $5.42 billion a year earlier. Diluted earnings per share fell 31 percent to $0.82 from $1.18.
Lower net income resulted from a $1.33 billion decline in earnings in Global Corporate and Investment Banking given the significant disruption in the financial markets during the quarter. Provision expense increased $865 million due to consumer and small business credit costs rising from post bankruptcy reform lows, growth and seasoning in various portfolios and stress in several portfolios driven by the weakened U.S. housing market.
"While the significant dislocations in the capital markets have hurt most participants, we are still very disappointed in our third quarter performance," said Kenneth D. Lewis, chairman and chief executive officer. "However, the majority of our businesses experienced solid revenue growth as sales momentum continued, demonstrating the value of our diverse business mix. We continued to invest in our businesses for the long-term and to introduce innovative products and services to differentiate Bank of America in the marketplace. While we cannot predict the near-term, I am confident that such innovation and execution combined with the advantages of scale and reach are the formula for future success."

Third Quarter 2007 Financial Summary
Revenue
Revenue net of interest expense on a fully taxable-equivalent basis declined 12 percent to $16.30 billion from $18.49 billion in the third quarter 2006.
Noninterest income fell 24 percent to $7.31 billion from $9.60 billion in the third quarter of 2006. The decrease was mainly due to trading account losses of $1.46 billion and the absence of a gain on the sale of the company's operations in Brazil recognized in the third quarter of last year. The decrease was partially offset by the absence of a $469 million loss on the sale of debt securities a year earlier and improvements in investment and brokerage services and equity investment income.
Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was $8.99 billion compared with $8.89 billion the previous year. The net interest yield narrowed 12 basis points to 2.61 percent.
Efficiency
Noninterest expense decreased 4 percent to $8.54 billion from $8.86 billion a year earlier as a result of lower capital markets incentive compensation and pretax merger and restructuring charges. Pretax merger and restructuring charges mainly related to the U.S. Trust acquisition were $84 million compared with $269 million a year earlier which were associated with the MBNA purchase. The efficiency ratio on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was 52.40 percent.
Results shown are defined by Global Wealth and Investment Management's calculation of the percentage of assets under management in the top two quartiles of categories based on Morningstar as of August 31, 2007. The category percentile rank was calculated by ranking the three year net return of share classes within the categories. The assets of the number of funds within the top 2 quartile results were added and then divided by Global Wealth and Investment Management's total assets under management. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The share class earning the ranking may have limited eligibility and may not be available to all investors.

Credit Quality
Credit costs continued to rise from the unusually low levels experienced in 2006 post bankruptcy reform. Given weakened housing and capital markets conditions, certain sectors began to experience some weakness. However, overall credit quality remained sound as credit card losses stabilized, declining from the second quarter.
Provision expense in the third quarter rose from a year ago due to higher net charge-offs and increased reserves from the seasoning of the small business and home equity portfolios, reflecting growth in these businesses. The company also added reserves for its home equity and homebuilder loan portfolios in view of the impact of the weakened U.S. housing market.
 
 
 
 
 
Capital Management
Total shareholders' equity was $138.51 billion at September 30. Period-end assets were $1.6 trillion. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.22 percent, down from 8.52 percent at June 30, 2007 and 8.48 percent a year ago due to the impact of the U.S. Trust acquisition.
During the quarter, Bank of America paid a cash dividend of $0.64 per share. The company also issued 9.5 million common shares related to employee stock options and ownership plans and repurchased 9.6 million common shares. Period-ending common shares issued and outstanding were 4.44 billion for the third quarter of 2007, compared with 4.44 billion for the second quarter of 2007 and 4.50 billion for the third quarter of 2006.

Managed net revenue rose 6 percent as higher card income and service charge income helped generate an 11 percent increase in noninterest income. Net income decreased 16 percent from a year ago as credit costs rose.
The provision for credit losses increased 52 percent to $3.12 billion. The increase resulted mainly from portfolio seasoning due to growth in the businesses and increased losses post bankruptcy reform. The weak housing market also contributed to adding reserves for the home equity portfolio.

In July, Bank of America completed the acquisition of U.S. Trust, creating U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management, within Global Wealth and Investment Management to serve wealthy and ultra-wealthy clients.
Net revenue in Global Wealth and Investment Management increased 24 percent as higher customer activity and improved client asset inflows resulted in a 34 percent increase in noninterest income. Net income increased 17 percent from a year ago as fee income increased. The acquisition of U.S. Trust contributed about 10 percent to net revenue and 5 percent to net income.
Asset management fees increased 42 percent to a record $976 million driven by higher assets under management helped by nearly $116 billion in assets added from the acquisition of U.S. Trust, net asset inflows of more than $44 billion and increased market values of more than $38 billion.

All Other net income was $547 million compared with $551 million a year earlier. Revenue compared with last year was lower without the contribution from the sale of Brazil operations. This was offset partly by reduced other expenses from certain liquidating businesses. Equity investments income rose 24 percent to $852 million from $687 million.

Reconciliation to GAAP financial measures
Supplemental financial data presented on an operating basis is a basis of presentation not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) that excludes merger and restructuring charges. We believe that the exclusion of merger and restructuring charges, which represent events outside our normal operations, provides a meaningful period-to-period comparison and is more reflective of normalized operations.
Return on average common shareholders' equity and return on average tangible shareholders' equity utilize non-GAAP allocation methodologies. Return on average common shareholders' equity measures the earnings contribution of a unit as a percentage of the shareholders' equity allocated to that unit. Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures the earnings contribution of the Corporation as a percentage of shareholders' equity reduced by goodwill. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity (i.e., capital) at the individual unit level and are integral components in the analytics for resource allocation. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue. We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation.
Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. See the tables below for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the quarters ended September 30, 2007, June 30, 2007, March 31, 2007, December 31, 2006, and September 30, 2006, and the nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006.
