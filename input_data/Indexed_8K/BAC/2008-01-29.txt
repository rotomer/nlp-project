Dated:  January 29, 2008

New York, New York January 24, 2008
To the Representative named in Schedule I hereto of the Underwriters named in Schedule II hereto
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:
Bank of America Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to issue and sell to the underwriters named in Schedule II hereto (the "Underwriters"), for whom you are acting as representative (the "Representative") 6,000,000 shares (the "Initial Shares") of the Company's 7.25% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, Series L (the "Preferred Stock") convertible into shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"). 
The Company also grants to the Underwriters, severally and not jointly, the option described in Section 2 to purchase up to 900,000 additional shares of Preferred Stock (the "Option Shares"), to cover over-allotments.  The Initial Shares and the Option Shares also are referred to herein as the "Shares".  References to the shares of Common Stock include the shares of Common Stock into which the Shares are convertible.  Such Shares are to be sold to each Underwriter, acting severally and not jointly, in such amounts as are listed in Schedule II opposite the name of each Underwriter.  The Shares are described more fully in the Prospectus, referred to below.  If the firm or firms listed in Schedule II hereto include only the firm or firms listed in Schedule I hereto, then the terms "Underwriters" and "Representative", as used herein, each shall be deemed to refer to such firm or firms.
1.         Representations and Warranties.
(a)        The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each Underwriter that:
(i)         The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-133852), which contains a base prospectus (the "Base Prospectus"), to be used in connection with the public offering and sale of the Shares.  Such registration statement, as amended, including the financial statements, exhibits and schedules thereto, including any required information deemed to be a part thereof pursuant to Rule 430B under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Securities Act"), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act"), at each time of effectiveness, is called the "Registration Statement."  Any preliminary prospectus supplement to the Base  
 Prospectus that describes the Shares and the offering thereof and is used prior to filing of the Prospectus is called, together with the Base Prospectus, a "preliminary prospectus."  The term "Prospectus" shall mean the final prospectus supplement relating to the Shares, together with the Base Prospectus, that is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) after the date and time that this Agreement is executed and delivered by the parties hereto (the "Execution Time").  Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be, shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S3 under the Securities Act; any reference to any amendment or supplement to any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be, shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date of such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Exchange Act, and incorporated by reference in such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference to any amendment to the Registration Statement shall be deemed to refer to and include any annual report of the Company filed pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act after the effective date of the Registration Statement that is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.  All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, a preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing shall include any copy thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR").
(ii)        The term "Disclosure Package" shall mean (A) the preliminary prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented, (B) the Base Prospectus, (C) the applicable issuer free writing prospectuses as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act (each, an "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus"), if any, identified in Schedule III hereto, and (D) any other free writing prospectus that the parties hereto shall hereafter expressly agree in writing to treat as part of the Disclosure Package.  As of 10:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the date of this Agreement (the "Initial Sale Time"), the Disclosure Package did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  The preceding sentence does not apply to statements in or omissions from the Disclosure Package based upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists only of the information described as such in Section 8(b) hereof (the "Underwriter Information").
(iii)       As of the date hereof, when the Prospectus is first filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, when any supplement or amendment to the Prospectus is filed with the Commission, at the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) and, with respect to the Registration Statement in (A) and (B) below, as of the Initial Sale Time, (A) the Registration Statement is effective, the Registration Statement, as amended as of any such time, and the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of any such time complied, complies or will comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, (B) the Registration Statement, as amended as of any such time, did not, does not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, and (C) the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of any such time, did not, does not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any                                                                                        2
 material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that the Company makes no representations or warranties as to the Underwriter Information.  The documents which are incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus or from which information is so incorporated by reference, when they were filed with the Commission, complied in all material respects with the requirements under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and did not, when such documents were so filed, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  The Commission has not issued any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any order preventing or suspending the use of the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, and the Company is without knowledge that any proceedings have been instituted for either purpose.
(iv)       (A) At the earliest time after the Company or another offering participant made a offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2) under the Securities Act) and (B) as of the date of the execution and delivery of this Agreement (with such date being used as a determination date for purposes of this clause (B)), the Company neither was nor is an Ineligible Issuer (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act).
bona fide
(v)        No Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (including any Final Term Sheet (as defined herein)), as of its date and at all subsequent times through the completion of the offering contemplated hereby or until any earlier date that the Company notified or notifies the Representative as described in the next sentence, included, includes or will include any information that conflicted, conflicts or will conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement, including any document incorporated by reference therein, the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, that had not or has not been superseded or modified.  If at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and prior to the end of the Prospectus Delivery Period (as defined below), there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, the Company has promptly notified or will promptly notify the Representative and has promptly amended or supplemented or will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict.  The foregoing two sentences do not apply to statements in or omissions from an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus based upon and in conformity with Underwriter Information.
(vi)       The Company has not distributed and will not distribute, prior to the later of the Closing Date and the completion of the Underwriters' distribution of the Shares, any offering material in connection with the offering and sale of the Shares other than the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus reviewed and consented to by the Underwriters and included in Schedule III hereto.
(vii)      (A) At the time of filing the Registration Statement, (B) at the time of the most recent amendment thereto for the purposes of complying with Section 10(a)(3) under the Securities Act (whether such amendment was by post-effective amendment, incorporated                                                                                        3
 report filed pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) under the Exchange Act or form of prospectus), (C) at the time the Company or any person acting on its behalf (within the meaning, for this clause only, of Rule 163(c) under the Securities Act) made any offer relating to the Shares in reliance on the exemption of Rule 163 under the Securities Act and (D) at the Execution Time (with such date being used as the determination date for purposes of this clause (D)), the Company was and is a "wellknown seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act.  The Registration Statement is an "automatic shelf registration statement," as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act, the Company has not received from the Commission any notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act objecting to use of the automatic shelf registration statement form and the Company has not otherwise ceased to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form.
(viii)      The Preferred Stock, including any shares of Preferred Stock subject to the over-allotment option described in Section 2 hereof, has been duly and validly authorized for issuance and sale, and, when the Initial Shares and any Option Shares are issued and delivered against payment therefor pursuant to this Agreement, the Preferred Stock will be duly and validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable; and the Preferred Stock conforms to the description thereof contained in the Registration Statement and Prospectus, as amended or supplemented.
(ix)       The shares of Common Stock initially issuable upon conversion of the Shares have been duly and validly authorized and reserved for issuance, and, when issued and delivered upon conversion of the Shares, will be duly and validly issued, and fully paid and non-assessable; and the Common Stock conforms to the description thereof contained in the Registration Statement and Prospectus, as amended or supplemented.
(x)        The issue and sale of the Preferred Stock, the issuance of the Common Stock upon conversion of the Shares and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions thereof and of this Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated, and the performance of its obligations hereunder, will not contravene any provision of applicable law, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or articles of association or bylaws of the Principal Subsidiary Bank or any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or the Principal Subsidiary Bank that is material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any judgment, order or decree of any governmental body, agency or court having jurisdiction over the Company or any subsidiary; and no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or qualification with, any governmental or regulatory body is required for the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, except such as may be required by the securities or Blue Sky laws of the various states in connection with the offer and sale of the Shares.
(xi)       The Company has not received any notice from the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") regarding the delisting of its Common Stock from the NYSE.
(xii)      The Company has filed a preliminary listing application and all required supporting documents with respect to the Shares with the NYSE and the Company has received no information stating that the Shares will not be authorized for trading, subject to official notice of issuance and evidence of satisfactory distribution.                                                                                          4
 
(b)        Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, represents and agrees that:
(i)         it has not and will not, directly or indirectly, offer, sell or deliver any of the Shares or distribute the preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any other offering materials (including any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or other free writing prospectuses) relating to the Shares in or from any jurisdiction except under circumstances that will, to the best of its knowledge and belief, result in compliance with any applicable laws and regulations thereof and that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, will not impose any obligations on the Company except as set forth herein; and
(ii)        it will comply in all material respects with the selling restrictions set forth in the Prospectus under the caption "Underwriting-Selling Restrictions."
2.         .       Subject to the terms and conditions and in reliance upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, the Company agrees to sell to each Underwriter, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company at the purchase price set forth in Schedule I hereto the respective number of Initial Shares set forth opposite such Underwriter's name in Schedule II hereto.
Purchase and Sale
In addition, on the basis of the representations and warranties contained herein, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company grants an option to the Underwriters, severally and not jointly, to purchase the Option Shares at the same price per share determined as provided above for the Initial Shares plus accrued dividends from the Closing Date (as defined below) to the date of delivery of the Option Shares.  The option hereby granted will expire 30 days after the date hereof, and may be exercised, in whole or in part (but not more than once), only for the purpose of covering over-allotments upon notice by the Representative to the Company setting forth the number of Option Shares as to which the several Underwriters are exercising the option, and the time and date of payment and delivery thereof.  Such time and date of delivery (the "Date of Delivery") shall be determined by the Representative but shall not be later than seven full business days after the exercise of such option and not in any event prior to the Closing Date.  If the option is exercised as to all or any portion of the Option Shares, the Option Shares as to which the option is exercised shall be purchased by the Underwriters severally and not jointly, in proportion to, as nearly as practicable, their respective Initial Shares underwriting obligations as set forth on Schedule II.
3.         .  Delivery of and payment for the Initial Shares shall be made on the date and at the time specified in Schedule I hereto, which date and time may be postponed by agreement between the Representative and the Company or as provided in Section 9 hereto (such date and time of delivery and payment for the Initial Shares being herein called the "Closing Date").  Delivery of the Initial Shares shall be made to the Representative for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters against payment by the several Underwriters through the Representative of the purchase price thereof in the manner set forth in Schedule I hereto.  Unless otherwise agreed, certificates for the Initial Shares shall be in book-entry form, and such certificates may be deposited with The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") or a custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC.                                                                                       5
Delivery and Payment
 
In addition, in the event that any or all of the Option Shares are purchased by the Underwriters, delivery and payment for the Option Shares shall be made at the office specified for delivery of the Initial Shares in Schedule I hereto, or at such other place as the Company and the Representative shall determine, on the Date of Delivery as specified in the notice from the Representative to the Company.  Delivery of the Option Shares shall be made to the Representative against payment by the Underwriters through the Representative of the purchase price thereof to or upon the order of the Company in the manner set forth in Schedule I hereto.  Unless otherwise agreed, certificates for the Option Shares shall be in the form set forth in Schedule I hereto, and such certificates shall be registered in such names and in such denominations as the Representative may request not less than three full business days in advance of the Date of Delivery.
4.         .  The Company agrees with the several Underwriters that:
Agreements
(a)        During the period beginning at the Initial Sale Time and ending on the later of the Closing Date or such date, as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, the Prospectus is no longer required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Underwriter or dealer (except for delivery requirements imposed because such Underwriter or dealer is an affiliate of the Company), including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 (the "Prospectus Delivery Period"), the Company will not file any amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement to the Base Prospectus or the Disclosure Package (including the Prospectus) unless the Company has furnished you a copy for your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object.  Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Company will cause the Prospectus to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 via EDGAR.  The Company will advise the Representative promptly (i) when the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424, (ii) when any amendment to the Registration Statement or the Disclosure Package relating to the Shares shall have become effective, (iii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or amendment of or supplement to the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Shares for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose.  The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.
(b)        If, at any time during the Prospectus Delivery Period, except with respect to any such delivery requirement imposed upon an affiliate of the Company in connection with any secondary market sales, any event occurs as a result of which the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made or then prevailing, as the case may be, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus to comply with the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, the Company promptly will prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the first sentence of paragraph (a) of this                                                                                      6
 Section 4, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment or supplement which will effect such compliance (including, if consented to by the Underwriters, by means of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus), and will give immediate notice, and confirm in writing, to the Underwriters to cease the solicitation of offers to purchase the Shares, and furnish to the Underwriters a reasonable number of copies of such amendment or supplement.
(c)        The Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representative as soon as practicable, but not later than 60 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement (in form complying with the provisions of Rule 158 under the Securities Act) covering a twelve-month period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the "effective date" (as defined in said Rule 158) of the Registration Statement.
(d)        The Company will furnish to the Representative and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and each amendment thereto which shall become effective on or prior to the Closing Date and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Securities Act, as many copies of the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus and any amendments thereof and supplements thereto as the Representative may reasonably request.  The Company will pay the expenses of printing all documents relating to the offering.
(e)        The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Shares for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representative may reasonably designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Shares and will arrange for the determination of the legality of the Shares for purchase by investors; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general or unlimited service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
(f)         Until the business day following the Closing Date, the Company will not, without the consent of the Representative, offer or sell, or announce the offering of, any securities covered by the Registration Statement or by any other registration statement filed under the Securities Act; provided, however, the Company may, at any time, offer or sell or announce the offering of securities (i) covered by a registration statement on Form S-8 or (ii) covered by a registration statement on Form S-3 and (A) pursuant to which the Company issues securities under one of the Company's medium-term note programs (including, without limitation, the Company's Series K Medium-Term Note Program and the Company's InterNotes Program), (B) pursuant to which the Company issues securities for its dividend reinvestment plan, (C) pursuant to which the Company issues notes, a series of depositary shares or a series of preferred stock in an underwritten offering in which the lead manager is Banc of America Securities LLC (under Registration Statement No. 333-133852) or (D) pursuant to which affiliates of the Company offer securities of the Company in secondary market transactions.
(g)        The Company will prepare a final term sheet containing only a description of the Shares, in a form approved by the Representative and contained in Schedule IV of this Agreement, and will file the such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act as                                                                                              7
 promptly as possible, but in any case not later than the time required by such rule (such term sheet, the "Final Term Sheet").
(h)        The Company represents that it has not made and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Representative, it will not make any offer relating to the Shares that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433 under the Securities Act; provided that the prior written consent of the Representative shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule III hereto.  Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representative is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus."  The Company agrees that (i) it has treated and will treat as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and (ii) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 under the Securities Act applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.  The Company consents to the use by any Underwriter of a free writing prospectus that (a) is not an "issuer free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 433, and (b) contains only (i) information describing the preliminary terms of the Shares or their offering, (ii) information permitted by Rule 134 under the Securities Act or (iii) information that describes the final terms of the Shares or their offering and that is included in the Final Term Sheet of the Company contemplated in paragraph (g) above.
(i)         If immediately prior to the third anniversary (the "Renewal Deadline") of the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, any of the Shares remain unsold by the Underwriters, the Company will file prior to the Renewal Deadline, if it has not already done so and is eligible to do so, a new automatic shelf registration statement relating to the Shares, in a form satisfactory to the Representative.  If the Company is no longer eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the Company will file prior to the Renewal Deadline, if it has not already done so, a new shelf registration statement relating to the Shares, in a form satisfactory to the Representative, and will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 60 days after the Renewal Deadline.  The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Shares to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement relating to the Shares.  References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be.

 which such Underwriter or such controlling person may become subject, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, including any information deemed to be a part thereof pursuant to Rule 430B under the Securities Act, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and to reimburse each Underwriter and each such controlling person for any and all expenses (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by Banc of America Securities LLC) as such expenses are reasonably incurred by such Underwriter or such controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense to the extent, but only to the extent, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with the Underwriter Information.  The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(a) shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Company may otherwise have.
(b)        Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (ii) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Base Prospectus, the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, and only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), in reliance upon and in conformity with the Underwriter Information; and to reimburse the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person for any legal and other expense reasonably incurred by the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action.  The Company hereby acknowledges that the only information that the Underwriters have furnished to the Company expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) are the names of the Underwriters, the sentences relating to concessions and reallowances and the statements set forth in the seventh and eighth paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting" in the                                                                                             19
 preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus.  The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(b) shall be in addition to any liabilities that each Underwriter may otherwise have.
(c)        Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure to so notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any liability other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above.  In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties.  Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (other than local counsel approved by the Representative)), representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action) or (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
(d)        The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such                                                                                  20
 action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(e)        If the indemnification provided for in Sections 8(a) through (d) is for any reason unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Shares as set forth on such cover.  The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact or any such inaccurate or alleged inaccurate representation or warranty relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(c), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.  The provisions set forth in Section 8(c) with respect to notice of commencement of any action shall apply if a claim for contribution is to be made under this Section 8; , , that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given in accordance with Section 8(c) for purposes of indemnification.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 8(e).
provided
however
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts received by such Underwriter in connection with the Shares underwritten by it.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) under the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters'                                                                                           21
 obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(e) are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their names in Schedule II.  For purposes of this Section 8(e), each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.  Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (e), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, as contemplated by the preceding paragraph.  However, the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (e).
9.         .  If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Shares agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Shares set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bear to the aggregate amount of Shares set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Shares which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate amount of Shares which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Shares set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Shares, and if such non-defaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Shares, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company.  In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representative shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
Default by an Underwriter
10.       .  This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representative, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Shares, if prior to such time (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, or (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in the commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or material escalation of hostilities or other calamity or crisis (in the United States or elsewhere) the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representative, impracticable to market the Shares.                                                                                        22
Termination
 
11.       .  The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Shares.  The provisions of Section 6 and 8 hereof and this Section 11 shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

(ii)                Prior to the close of business on the Optional Conversion Date or any applicable Conversion Date, shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of, or other securities issuable upon conversion of, any shares of Series L Preferred Stock shall not be deemed outstanding for any purpose, and Holders shall have no rights with respect to the Common Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion (including voting rights, rights to respond to tender offers for the Common Stock and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on the Common Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion) by virtue of holding shares of Series L Preferred Stock.
(iii)               Shares of Series L Preferred Stock duly converted in accordance with the terms hereof, or otherwise reacquired by the Corporation, will resume the status of authorized and unissued preferred stock, undesignated as to series and available for future issuance.

In the event that a Holder shall not by written notice designate the name in which shares of Common Stock and/or cash, securities or other property (including payments of cash in lieu of fractional shares) to be issued or paid upon conversion of shares of Series L Preferred Stock should be registered or paid or the manner in which such shares should be delivered, the Corporation shall be entitled to register and deliver such shares, and make such payment, in the name of the Holder and in the manner shown on the records of the Corporation or, in the case of global certificates, through book-entry transfer through the Depository.
(v)                Conversion into shares of Common Stock will occur on the Optional Conversion Date or any applicable Conversion Date as follows:
(A)              On the Optional Conversion Date, certificates representing shares of Common Stock shall be issued and delivered to Holders or their designee upon presentation and surrender of the certificate evidencing the Series L Preferred Stock to the Conversion Agent if shares of the Series L Preferred Stock are held in certificated form, and, if required, the furnishing of appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and the payment of all transfer and similar taxes.

(4)               if required, pay all transfer or similar taxes; and
(5)               if required, pay funds equal to any declared and unpaid dividend payable on the next Dividend Payment Date to which such Holder is entitled.
If a Holder's interest is a beneficial interest in a global certificate representing Series L Preferred Stock, in order to convert a Holder must comply with paragraphs (3) through (5) listed above and comply with the Depository's procedures for converting a beneficial interest in a global security.                                                                                      8

If the Conversion Date is after the record date relating to any declared dividend and prior to the Dividend Payment Date, the Holder will receive that dividend on the relevant Dividend Payment Date if the Holder was the holder of record on the record date for that dividend.  However, if the Conversion Date is after the record date and prior to the Dividend Payment Date, whether or not the Holder was the holder of record on the record date, the Holder must pay to the Conversion Agent when it converts its shares of Series L Preferred Stock an amount in cash equal to the full dividend actually paid on the Dividend Payment Date for the then-current Dividend Period on the shares of Series L Preferred Stock being converted, unless the Holder's shares of Series L Preferred Stock are being converted as a result of a conversion pursuant to Section 6(b), Section 6(c) or Section 6(d).

If the Corporation exercises its optional conversion right on January 30, 2013, it will still pay any dividend payable (in accordance with Section 4) on January 30, 2013 to the applicable Holders of record.  The Corporation will provide notice of its optional conversion within five Trading Days of the end of the 30 consecutive Trading Day period.

If the Conversion Agent selects a portion of a Holder's Series L Preferred Stock for partial conversion at the Corporation's option and such Holder converts a portion of its shares of Series L Preferred Stock, the converted portion will be deemed to be from the portion selected for conversion at the Corporation's option under this Section 6(b).

Section 7.               
Anti-Dilution Adjustments
(a)                The Conversion Rate shall be subject to the following adjustments.
(i)                  .  If the Corporation pays dividends or other distributions on the Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Rate in effect immediately following the record date for such dividend or distribution will be multiplied by the following fraction:
Stock Dividend Distributions
Where,
OS = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution.
0
OS = the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution plus the total number of shares of Common Stock constituting such dividend.
1
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment will be made for the issuance of the Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to all holders of Common Stock that is made in lieu of quarterly dividends or distributions to such holders, to the extent such dividend or distribution does not exceed the dividend threshold amount defined in clause (v) below.  For purposes of this paragraph, the amount of any dividend or distribution will equal the number of shares being issued multiplied by the average VWAP of the Common Stock over each of the five consecutive Trading Days prior to the record date for such distribution.
(ii)                .  If the Corporation subdivides, splits, or combines the shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Rate in effect immediately following the effective date of such share subdivision, split, or combination will be multiplied by the following fraction:

Where,
OS = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of such share subdivision, split, or combination.
0
OS = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the opening of business on the effective date of such share subdivision, split, or combination.

(iii)               .  If the Corporation issues to all holders of the shares of Common Stock rights or warrants (other than rights or warrants issued                                                                                          14
Issuance of Stock Purchase Rights
 pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan or share purchase plan or other similar plans) entitling them, for a period of up to 60 days from the date of issuance of such rights or warrants, to subscribe for or purchase the shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into shares of Common Stock) at less than (or having a conversion price per share less than) the Current Market Price on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants, then the Conversion Rate in effect immediately following the close of business on the record date for such distribution will be multiplied by the following fraction:
Where,
OS = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date for such distribution.
0
X = the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights or warrants (or upon conversion of such securities).
Y = the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights or warrants (or the conversion price for such securities) divided by the Current Market Price.
To the extent that such rights or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration or shares of Common Stock are otherwise not delivered pursuant to such rights or warrants upon the exercise of such rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to such Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustment made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.  In determining the aggregate offering price payable for such shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Agent will take into account any consideration received for such rights or warrants and the value of such consideration (if other than cash, to be determined by the Board).
(iv)              .  If the Corporation distributes to all holders of shares of Common Stock evidences of indebtedness, shares of capital stock (other than Common Stock), securities, or other assets (excluding any dividend or distribution referred to in clauses (i) or (ii) above, any rights or warrants referred to in clause (iii) above, any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash, any consideration payable in connection with a tender or exchange offer made by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, and any dividend of shares of capital stock of any class or series, or similar equity interests, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit in the case of certain spin-off transactions as described below), then the Conversion Rate in effect immediately following the close of business on the record date for such distribution will be multiplied by the following fraction:
Debt or Asset Distributions
                                                                                       15
Where,
SP = the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the Ex-Date.
0
FMV = the fair market value of the portion of the distribution applicable to one share of Common Stock on the date immediately preceding the Ex-Date as determined by the Board.
In a spin-off, where the Corporation makes a distribution to all holders of shares of Common Stock consisting of capital stock of any class or series, or similar equity interests of, or relating to, a subsidiary or other business unit, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted on the fifteenth Trading Day after the effective date of the distribution by multiplying such Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to such fifteenth Trading Day by the following fraction:
Where,
MP = the average of the VWAP of the Common Stock over each of the first ten Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day following the effective date of such distribution.
0
MP = the average of the VWAP of the capital stock or equity interests representing the portion of the distribution applicable to one share of Common Stock over each of the first ten Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day following the effective date of such distribution, or, if not traded on a national or regional securities exchange or over-the-counter market, the fair market value of the capital stock or equity interests representing the portion of the distribution applicable to one share of Common Stock on such date as determined by the Board.
s
(v)                .  If the Corporation makes a distribution consisting exclusively of cash to all holders of the Common Stock, excluding (a) any cash dividend on the Common Stock to the extent that the aggregate cash dividend per share of the Common Stock does not exceed $0.64 in any fiscal quarter (the ""), (b) any cash that is distributed in a Reorganization Event or as part of a spin-off referred to in clause (iv) above, (c) any dividend or distribution, in connection with the Corporation's liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, and (d) any consideration payable in connection with a tender or exchange offer made by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, then in each event, the Conversion Rate in effect immediately following the record date for such distribution will be multiplied by the following fraction:
Cash Distributions
Dividend Threshold Amount
 
Where,
                                                                                          16
 
 
SP = the VWAP per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date.
0
DIV = the cash amount per share of Common Stock of the dividend or distribution, as determined pursuant to the following paragraph.
If an adjustment is required to be made as set forth in this clause as a result of a distribution (1) that is a regularly scheduled quarterly dividend, such adjustment would be based on the amount by which such dividend exceeds the Dividend Threshold Amount or (2) that is not a regularly scheduled quarterly dividend, such adjustment would be based on the full amount of such distribution.
The Dividend Threshold Amount is subject to adjustment on an inversely proportional basis whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted; that no adjustment will be made to the Dividend Threshold Amount for any adjustment made to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this clause (v).
provided
(vi)              .  If the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries successfully completes a tender or exchange offer for the Common Stock where the cash and the value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of the Common Stock exceeds the VWAP per share of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately succeeding the expiration of the tender or exchange offer, then the Conversion Rate in effect at the close of business on such immediately succeeding Trading Day will be multiplied by the following fraction:
Self-Tender Offers and Exchange Offers
Where,
SP = the VWAP per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately succeeding the expiration of the tender or exchange offer.
0
OS= the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the expiration of the tender or exchange offer, including any shares validly tendered and not withdrawn (the "").
0
Purchased Shares
OS= the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the expiration of the tender or exchange offer, less any Purchased Shares.
1
AC = the aggregate cash and fair market value of the other consideration payable in the tender or exchange offer, as determined by the Board.
In the event that the Corporation, or one of its subsidiaries, is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange offer, but the Corporation, or such subsidiary, is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted                                                                                        17
 to be such Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had not been made.
(vii)             .  To the extent that the Corporation has a rights plan in effect with respect to the Common Stock on any Conversion Date, upon conversion of any shares of the Series L Preferred Stock, Holders will receive, in addition to the shares of Common Stock, the rights under the rights plan, unless, prior to such Conversion Date, the rights have separated from the shares of Common Stock, in which case the Conversion Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Corporation had made a distribution to all holders of the Common Stock as described in clause (iv) above, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination, or redemption of such rights.
Rights Plans
(b)               The Corporation may make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to any other increases required by this Section 7, if the Corporation deems it advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of the Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock (or issuance of rights or warrants to acquire shares of Common Stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reason.
(c)                (i) All adjustments to the Conversion Rate shall be calculated to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share of Common Stock.  No adjustment in the Conversion Rate will be made unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent therein; , that any adjustments which by reason of this subparagraph are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment; that on the Optional Conversion Date, the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date or the effective date of a Fundamental Change, adjustments to the Conversion Rate will be made with respect to any such adjustment carried forward and which has not been taken into account before such date.
provided
provided further
(ii)                No adjustment to the Conversion Rate shall be made if Holders may participate in the transaction that would otherwise give rise to an adjustment, as a result of holding the Series L Preferred Stock, without having to convert the Series L Preferred Stock, as if they held the full number of shares of Common Stock into which their shares of the Series L Preferred Stock may then be converted.
(iii)               The Applicable Conversion Rate will not be adjusted:
(A)              upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Corporation's securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan;
(B)              upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock or rights or warrants to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director, or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries;                                                                                     18

(D)              for a change in the par value or no par value of the Common Stock; or
(E)               for accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series L Preferred Stock.
(d)               Whenever the Conversion Rate is to be adjusted in accordance with Section 7(a) or Section 7(b), the Corporation shall: (i) compute the Conversion Rate in accordance with Section 7(a) or Section 7(b), taking into account the one percent threshold set forth in Section 7(c) hereof, and prepare and transmit to the Transfer Agent an officer's certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based; (ii) as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an event that requires an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 7(a) or Section 7(b), taking into account the one percent threshold set forth in Section 7(c) hereof (or if the Corporation is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware), provide, or cause to be provided, a written notice to the Holders of the occurrence of such event; and (iii) as soon as practicable following the determination of the revised Conversion Rate in accordance with Section 7(a) or Section 7(b) hereof, provide, or cause to be provided, a written notice to the Holders setting forth in reasonable detail the method by which the adjustment to the Conversion Rate was determined and setting forth the revised Conversion Rate.

Bank of America Corporation Bank of America Corporate Center 100 North Tryon Street Charlotte, North Carolina  28255-0065 Re:  7.25% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, Series L
Ladies and Gentlemen: 
            We have acted as counsel to Bank of America Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), in connection with (i) the issuance of up to 6,900,000 shares of 7.25% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, Series L (the "Preferred Stock"), pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated January 24, 2008 among the Corporation and Banc of America Securities LLC, as the sole Underwriter (the "Underwriting Agreement") and (ii) the Registration Statement on Form S3, Registration No. 333133852 (the "Registration Statement"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), with respect to the Corporation's unsecured debt securities, units, warrants, preferred stock, depositary shares and common stock, and the Prospectus dated May 5, 2006, constituting a part of the Registration Statement, as supplemented by the Final Prospectus Supplement dated January 24, 2008, filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, relating to the Preferred Stock.
            As such counsel, we have examined and are familiar with such original or photocopies or certified copies of such records of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, certificates of officers of the Corporation and of public officials and such other documents as we have deemed relevant or necessary as the basis for the opinion set forth below.  In such examinations, we have assumed the legal capacity of natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures on, and the authenticity of, all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified copies or photocopies and the authenticity of the originals of such copies.  We have also relied upon statements of fact contained in documents that we have examined in connection with our representation of the Corporation.
            Based solely upon the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, and subject to the limitations, qualifications and exceptions set forth below, we are of the opinion that the shares of Preferred Stock have been duly authorized and, when paid for as contemplated in the Underwriting Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.  The common stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, when issued and delivered in accordance with the terms of the Preferred Stock, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
            We hereby consent to be named in the Registration Statement as attorneys who passed upon the legality of the Preferred Stock and to the filing of a copy of this opinion as part of the Corporation's Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed for the purpose of including this opinion as part of the Registration Statement.
Very truly yours,
                                                                          /s/ HELMS MULLISS & WICKER, PLLC
