To the Selling Agents listed on
Exhibit A hereto and to

that shall become a Selling Agent
pursuant to Section 1(f)
of this Agreement.
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:
Bank of America Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), has authorized and proposes to issue and sell from time to time in the manner contemplated by this Agreement its Senior Medium-Term Notes, Series L (the "Senior Notes") and its Subordinated Medium-Term Notes, Series L (the "Subordinated Notes," and together with the Senior Notes, the "Notes"). The Senior Notes will be issued pursuant to an Indenture dated as of January 1, 1995 between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (the "Senior Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 18, 1998, the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 7, 2001, the Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of July 28, 2004, and the Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 28, 2006 (collectively, the "Senior Indenture"). The Subordinated Notes will be issued pursuant to an Indenture dated as of January 1, 1995 between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (the "Subordinated Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of August 28, 1998 and the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of January 25, 2007 (collectively, the "Subordinated Indenture"). The Senior Trustee and the Subordinated Trustee are collectively referred to herein as the "Trustees," and the Senior Indenture and the Subordinated Indenture are collectively referred to herein as the "Indentures."
The Notes are unsecured debt securities which have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the "Securities Act"), on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), pursuant to Registration No. 333-133852. The registration statement became automatically effective upon filing with the Commission, and the Indentures have been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the "Trust Indenture Act"). Such registration statement, as amended, including the financial statements, exhibits and schedules thereto, including any required information deemed to be a part thereof at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Securities Act or pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the "Exchange Act"), at each time of effectiveness, is called the "Registration Statement." The term "Base Prospectus" shall refer to the prospectus for the Company's debt securities and other securities filed as part of the Registration Statement for the offering of the Notes, together with the medium-term notes prospectus
supplement dated April 10, 2008, or any amendment thereto, but not including any Pricing Supplement (as defined below), any product supplement, any preliminary pricing supplement or any free writing prospectus (as such term is used in Rule 405 under the Securities Act). The term "Prospectus" shall refer to the Base Prospectus, together with the applicable Pricing Supplement and any applicable product supplement. Any preliminary pricing supplement to the Base Prospectus that describes an issuance of the Notes and the offering thereof and that is used prior to filing of the Prospectus is called, together with the Base Prospectus, a "preliminary pricing supplement."
Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, any preliminary pricing supplement or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act; any reference to any amendment or supplement to any preliminary pricing supplement or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date of such preliminary pricing supplement or Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Exchange Act, and incorporated by reference in such preliminary pricing supplement or Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference to any amendment to the Registration Statement shall be deemed to refer to and include any annual report of the Company filed pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act after the effective date of the Registration Statement that is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement. All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, a preliminary pricing supplement, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing, shall include any copy thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR").
The Company confirms its agreement with each of you (individually, a "Selling Agent" and collectively, the "Selling Agents") with respect to the issue and sale from time to time by the Company of the Notes as follows:
SECTION 1. .
Appointment of Selling Agents
(a) . Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein, and subject to the reservation by the Company of the right to sell Notes directly on its own behalf, the Company hereby appoints each of you as a Selling Agent in connection with the offer and sale of the Notes. The Company reserves the right to sell Notes, at any time, on its own behalf to any unsolicited purchaser, whether directly to such purchaser or through an agent for such purchaser. Upon the sale of any Notes to an unsolicited purchaser, no Selling Agent named herein shall be entitled to any commission pursuant to this Agreement.
Appointment
(b) . (i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Selling Agent agrees, as agent of the Company, to use its reasonable best efforts when requested by the Company to solicit offers to purchase the Notes upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus and the administrative procedures with respect to the sale of Notes as may be agreed upon from time to time between the Selling Agents and the Company (the "Procedures"). The initial Procedures dated as of April 10, 2008 and set forth in to this Agreement shall remain in effect until changed in an amendment signed by the Selling Agents and the Company. The Selling Agents and the Company agree to perform the respective duties and obligations specifically provided to be performed by them in the Procedures. Notwithstanding any
Solicitations as Selling Agent
Annex I
 
provision herein to the contrary, the Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to suspend solicitation of purchases of the Notes through the Selling Agents, as agents, commencing at any time for any period of time or permanently. The Company will timely deliver notice to the Selling Agents of its decision to suspend solicitations. Upon receipt of instructions from the Company, the Selling Agents will forthwith suspend solicitation of purchases of the Notes until such time as the Company has advised the Selling Agents that such solicitation may be resumed.
(ii) Each Selling Agent will communicate to the Company, orally, each offer to purchase Notes solicited by such Selling Agent on an agency basis, other than those offers rejected by the Selling Agent. Each Selling Agent shall have the right, in its discretion reasonably exercised, to reject any proposed purchase of Notes, in whole or in part, by persons solicited by the Selling Agent and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach of such Selling Agent's agreement contained herein. The Company may accept or reject any proposed purchase of the Notes, in whole or in part, and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach of the Company's agreement herein.
(iii) All Notes sold through a Selling Agent, as agent, will be sold at 100% of their principal amount unless otherwise agreed to by the Company and such Selling Agent. The principal amount of Notes to be purchased by such Selling Agent, the maturity date of such Notes, the price to be paid to the Company for such Notes, the interest rate and interest rate formula, if any, applicable to such Notes and any other terms of such Notes specified in hereto shall be agreed upon by the Company and such Selling Agent (each such agreement, a "Terms Agreement") and set forth in a pricing supplement to the Base Prospectus (a "Pricing Supplement") to be prepared following each acceptance by the Company of an offer for the purchase of Notes. A Pricing Supplement may include one or more product supplements that may be filed by the Company under Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act on or after the date of this Agreement. The applicable product supplement or product supplements shall be deemed to be part of the applicable Pricing Supplement for purposes of this Agreement.
Exhibit B
(iv) Each Selling Agent shall use its reasonable efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Notes has been solicited by such Selling Agent and accepted by the Company. Each Selling Agent shall not have any liability to the Company if any such agency purchase is not consummated for any reason. If the Company shall default on its obligation to deliver Notes to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Company shall (A) hold the Selling Agent for such purchase harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from or as a result of such default by the Company and (B) notwithstanding such default, pay to such Selling Agent any commission to which it would be entitled in connection with such sale.
(c) . For those offers to purchase Notes solicited by a Selling Agent and accepted by the Company, the Selling Agent shall be paid a commission to be agreed between the Company and the Selling Agent. In the absence of such an agreement, such commission shall be an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the principal amount of each series of Notes sold by the Company as a result of a solicitation made by such Selling Agent as set forth in hereto.
Commissions
Exhibit C
 
(d) .
Purchases as Principal
(i) The Selling Agents shall not have any obligation to purchase Notes from the Company as principal. However, a Selling Agent and the Company may expressly agree from time to time that such Selling Agent shall purchase Notes as principal. Unless otherwise agreed between the Company and the Selling Agent and, if required by law or otherwise, disclosed in a Pricing Supplement, each series of Notes sold to a Selling Agent as principal shall be purchased by such Selling Agent at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof less a discount equivalent to the applicable commissions set forth in hereto and may be resold by such Selling Agent at prevailing market prices at the time or times of resale as determined by such Selling Agent.
Exhibit C
(ii) A Selling Agent's commitment to purchase Notes as principal shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations, warranties and covenants of the Company herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, including Section 11(b) hereof. When a Selling Agent and the Company agree that such Selling Agent shall purchase Notes as principal, that agreement shall take the form of (A) a written agreement between such Selling Agent and the Company, which may be substantially in the form of hereto (a "Written Terms Agreement") or (B) an oral agreement between such Selling Agent and the Company confirmed in writing by such Selling Agent to the Company.
Exhibit D
(iii) Each Written Terms Agreement shall specify the principal amount of Notes to be purchased by such Selling Agent pursuant thereto, the maturity date of such Notes, the price to be paid to the Company for such Notes, the interest rate and interest rate formula, if any, applicable to such Notes, selling restrictions and any other terms of such Notes. Each such Written Terms Agreement may also specify any requirements for officers' certificates, opinions of counsel and letters from the independent public registered accounting firm of the Company pursuant to Section 4 hereof. A Written Terms Agreement also may specify certain provisions relating to the reoffering of such Notes by such Selling Agent.
(e) . A Selling Agent may engage the services of any other broker or dealer in connection with the resale of any Notes purchased as principal, but no Selling Agent may appoint sub-agents without the prior consent of the Company. In connection with sales by a Selling Agent of Notes purchased by such Selling Agent as principal to other brokers or dealers, such Selling Agent may allow any portion of the discount received in connection with such purchases from the Company to such brokers and dealers.
Sub-Agents
(f) . Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Company reserves the right to appoint additional selling agents for the offer and sale of the Notes, which agency may be on an on-going basis or on a one-time basis. Any such additional selling agent shall become a party to this Agreement and shall thereafter be subject to the provisions hereof and entitled to the benefits hereunder upon the execution of a counterpart hereof or other form of acknowledgment of its appointment hereunder, including (but not limited to) the form of letter attached hereto as , and delivery to the Company of addresses for notice hereunder and under the Procedures. After the time an additional selling agent is appointed,

If such appointment is on an on-going basis, the Company will notify the other active Selling Agents of such appointment.

Selling Restrictions
(i) it has not and will not offer, sell or deliver any of the Notes, directly or indirectly, or distribute the Prospectus or any other offering materials (including any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (as defined below) or other free writing prospectuses) relating to the Notes in any jurisdiction except under circumstances that will result in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that will not impose any obligations on the Company except as set forth herein; and
(ii) it will comply in all material respects with (A) the selling restrictions set forth in the Base Prospectus under the caption "Supplemental Plan of DistributionSelling Restrictions" and (B) any additional selling restrictions set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement.

provided
however
(v) As of the Initial Sale Time with respect to each offering of Notes, the Disclosure Package (as defined below), taken as a whole, will comply in all material respects with the requirements under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The preceding sentence does not apply to statements in or omissions from the Disclosure Package based upon and in conformity with the Selling Agent Information. "Initial Sale Time" means, with respect to each offering of Notes, the time after the Time of Acceptance as to such Notes and immediately prior to a Selling Agent's initial entry into contracts with investors for the sale of such Notes, which such times shall be recorded by the Selling Agent and furnished to the Company, and deemed to be part of the applicable Terms Agreement or Written Terms Agreement. The term "Disclosure Package" shall mean, as to any offering of Notes, collectively,
 
(A) the Base Prospectus, (B) any preliminary pricing supplement, as amended or supplemented, (C) any applicable product supplement filed with the Commission prior to the Initial Sale Time, (D) the issuer free writing prospectuses as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act (including, if applicable, any Final Term Sheet (as defined herein)) (each, an "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus"), if any, used in connection with such offering and (E) any other free writing prospectus that the parties hereto shall hereafter expressly agree in writing to treat as part of the Disclosure Package.
(vi) No Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (including any Final Term Sheet), with respect to each offering of Notes, as of its issue date and at all subsequent times through the completion of such offering of Notes or until any earlier date that the Company notified or notifies the Selling Agents as described in the next sentence, includes or will include any information that conflicts or will conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement, including any document incorporated by reference therein, the Base Prospectus, any preliminary pricing supplement or any Pricing Supplement that has not been superseded or modified. If at any time following delivery of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and until the end of the applicable Prospectus Delivery Period (as defined below), there occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any preliminary pricing supplement or any Pricing Supplement, the Company will promptly notify the Selling Agents and will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict. The foregoing two sentences do not apply to statements in or omissions from any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus based upon and in conformity with the Selling Agent Information. The term "Prospectus Delivery Period" shall mean, as to any offering of Notes, the period beginning at the Initial Sale Time and ending on the later of the applicable Settlement Date or such date, as in the opinion of counsel for the Selling Agents, the Prospectus is no longer required to be delivered in connection with sales by a Selling Agent or dealer (except for delivery requirements imposed because such Selling Agent or dealer is an affiliate of the Company), including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 under the Securities Act.
(vii) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, at the time they were or hereafter are filed with the Commission, complied and will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and, when read together with the other information in the Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, at the date hereof, at the date of the Base Prospectus and at each Representation Date, did not and will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
(viii) The Commission has not issued any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any order preventing or suspending the use of the preliminary pricing supplement or the Prospectus, and the Company is without knowledge that any proceedings have been instituted for either purpose.
(ix) This Agreement (and any applicable Written Terms Agreement) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution, and delivery by you (or, in the case of a Written Terms Agreement, the applicable Selling Agents), constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable
 
against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors now or hereafter in effect, and to equitable principles that may limit the right to specific enforcement of remedies, and except insofar as the enforceability of the indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Agreement may be limited by federal and state securities laws, and further subject to 12 U.S.C. 1818(b)(6)(D) and similar bank regulatory powers and to the application of principles of public policy.
(x) Each Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company, has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act, and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the applicable Trustee, constitutes a legal, valid, and binding instrument of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors now or hereafter in effect, and to equitable principles that may limit the right to specific enforcement of remedies, and further subject to 12 U.S.C. 1818(b)(6)(D) and similar bank regulatory powers and to the application of principles of public policy; as of the time any Notes are issued and sold hereunder (and under any applicable Terms Agreement), the Notes will have been duly authorized and, when, completed, executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Selling Agents pursuant to this Agreement (and any applicable Written Terms Agreement), will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the applicable Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors now or hereafter in effect, and to equitable principles that may limit the right to specific enforcement of remedies, and further subject to 12 U.S.C. 1818(b)(6)(D) and similar bank regulatory powers and to the application of principles of public policy.
(xi) The Company has not distributed and will not distribute, prior to the later of the Settlement Date and the completion of the Selling Agents' distribution of any Notes issued hereunder, any offering material in connection with the offering and sale of those Notes other than the Base Prospectus, any preliminary pricing supplement, the Pricing Supplement, and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus reviewed and consented to by the applicable Selling Agents.
(xii) The Company has complied and will comply with all the provisions of Florida H.B. 1771, codified as Section 517.075 of the Florida Statutes, 1987, as amended, and all regulations promulgated thereunder relating to issuers doing business in Cuba; provided, however, that in the event that such Section 517.075 shall be repealed, or amended such that issuers shall no longer be required to disclose in prospectuses information regarding business activities in Cuba or that a broker, dealer or agent shall no longer be required to obtain a statement from issuers regarding such compliance, then this representation and agreement shall be of no further force and effect.
(b) . Any certificate signed by any director or officer of the Company and delivered to a Selling Agent or to counsel for such Selling Agent in connection with an offering of Notes or the sale of Notes to a Selling Agent as principal shall be deemed a

representation and warranty by the Company to such Selling Agent as to the matters covered thereby on the date of such certificate and at each Representation Date subsequent thereto.

The Company will notify the Selling Agents immediately of (i) the filing or effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement, (ii) the filing of any supplement to the Base Prospectus (including any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus) or any document to be filed pursuant to the Exchange Act, which will be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus (other than documents available via EDGAR), (iii) the receipt of any comments from the Commission with respect to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Disclosure Package (other than with respect to a document filed with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act which will be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus and the Prospectus), (iv) any request by the Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement, any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or any Disclosure Package or for additional information relating thereto (other than such a request with respect to a document filed with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act, which will be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus and the Prospectus), and (v) the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose. The Company will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment.
Notice of Certain Events
(b) . The Company will give the Selling Agents notice of its intention to file or prepare any additional registration statement with respect to the registration of additional Notes or any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package (other than an amendment or supplement providing solely for a change in the interest rates or maturity dates of Notes or similar changes or an amendment or supplement effected by the filing of a document with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act) and, upon request, will furnish the Selling Agents with copies of any such registration statement, amendment or supplement proposed to be filed or prepared a reasonable time in advance of such proposed filing or preparation, as the case may be, and will not file any such registration statement, amendment or supplement in a form as to which the Selling Agents or counsel to the Selling Agents reasonably object.
Notice of Certain Proposed Filings
(c) . The Company will deliver to the Selling Agents, without charge, as many signed and conformed copies of (i) the Indentures; (ii) the Registration Statement (as originally filed) and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus) and (iii) a certified copy of the corporate authorization of the issuance and sale of the Notes as the Selling Agents may reasonably request.

If a Selling Agent has advised the Company in writing that such Selling Agent is relying, in connection with any offering of Notes, upon the exemption from Section 5(b) of the Securities Act set forth in Rule 172 under the Securities Act, and the Company is unable to file the applicable Pricing Supplement within the time period specified in the previous sentence, the Company shall file such Pricing Supplement as soon as practicable thereafter, to the extent permitted by Rule 172(c)(3) under the Securities Act.

If such opinion is delivered pursuant to clause (iv) above at the request of a Selling Agent, such opinion shall also relate to (A) the applicable Disclosure Package as of the applicable Initial Time of Sale, (B) the applicable form of note representing the Notes described in the applicable Pricing Supplement and (C) if applicable, the Written Terms Agreement.

Indemnification of the Selling Agents
 
meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which such Selling Agent or such controlling person may become subject, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, including any information deemed to be a part thereof pursuant to Rule 430B under the Securities Act, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Base Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the information contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and to reimburse each Selling Agent and each such controlling person for any and all expenses (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Selling Agents) as such expenses are reasonably incurred by such Selling Agent or such controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action; , , that the foregoing indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense to the extent, but only to the extent, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with the Selling Agent Information (or arises out of or is based upon statements in or omissions from that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification of the Trustee (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of either of the Trustees). The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 7(a) shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
(b) . Each Selling Agent agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (ii) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the applicable Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, and only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), in reliance upon and in conformity with the Selling Agent Information; and to reimburse the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person for any legal and other expense reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or

action. The Company hereby acknowledges that the only Selling Agent Information consists of the statements set forth in (w) the eleventh and twelfth paragraphs under the caption "Supplemental Plan of Distribution" in the Base Prospectus, (x) the names of the Selling Agents in the applicable Pricing Supplement or Prospectus in the case of any purchases of Notes by a Selling Agent as principal, (y) as to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any statements specifically identified by a Selling Agent to the Company in writing prior to the distribution of such document as being subject to this sentence, and (z) any other statements agreed by the Company and the Selling Agents in the applicable Written Terms Agreement. The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 7(b) shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Selling Agents may otherwise have.
(c) . Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure to so notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any liability other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (A) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (other than local counsel approved by the Selling Agents)), representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action) or (B) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
Notifications and Other Indemnification Procedures
(d) . The indemnifying party under this Section 7 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the
Settlements
 
indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
SECTION 8. .
Contribution
If the indemnification provided for in Section 7 is for any reason unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Selling Agents, on the other hand, from the applicable offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Selling Agents, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Selling Agents, on the other hand, in connection with the applicable offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Notes pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total selling agents' commission received by the Selling Agents, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the applicable Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Notes as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Selling Agents, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact or any such inaccurate or alleged inaccurate representation or warranty relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Selling Agents, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7(c), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim. The provisions set forth in Section 7(c) with respect to notice of commencement of any action shall apply if a claim for contribution is to be made under this Section 8; provided, however, that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given in accordance with Section 7(c) for purposes of indemnification. The Company and the Selling Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if
 
the Selling Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 8.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Selling Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the selling commissions received by such Selling Agent in connection with the Notes sold by it. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Selling Agents' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several, and not joint, in proportion to the amount of Notes each Selling Agent sells through its efforts. For purposes of this Section 8, each Selling Agent and each person, if any, who controls a Selling Agent within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Selling Agent, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph, notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, as contemplated by the preceding paragraph. However, the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph.
SECTION 9. .
Payment of Expenses
Except as provided in the applicable Written Terms Agreement, the Company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including:
(a) The preparation, printing, delivery to the Selling Agents and filing of the Registration Statement, each product supplement, the Base Prospectus and the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus;
(b) The preparation, filing and reproduction of this Agreement;
(c) The preparation, printing, issuance and delivery of the Notes to the Selling Agents, including capital duties, stamp duties and transfer taxes, if any, payable upon issuance of any of the Notes, the sale of the Notes to the Selling Agents and the fees and expenses of any transfer agent or trustee for the Notes;
(d) The fees and expenses of counsel to any such transfer agent or trustee;
(e) The fees and disbursements of the Company's accountants and counsel, of the Trustees and their counsel, and of any registrar, transfer agent, paying agent or calculation agent;
(f) The reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Selling Agents incurred from time to time in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby;
(g) The qualification of the Notes under state securities or insurance laws in accordance with the provisions of Section 3(l) hereof, including filing fees and the reasonable fees
 
and disbursements of counsel for the Selling Agents in connection therewith and in connection with the preparation, printing, reproduction and delivery to the Selling Agents of any survey of the U.S. state securities laws governing the offering of the Notes;
(h) The preparation, printing, reproduction and delivery to the Selling Agents of copies of the Indentures and all supplements and amendments thereto;
(i) Any fees charged by rating agencies for the rating of the Notes;
(j) With prior Company approval, the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing of the Notes on any securities exchange;
(k) The fees and expenses, if any, incurred with respect to any filing with FINRA;
(l) Any advertising and other out-of-pocket expenses of the Selling Agents incurred with the approval of the Company;
(m) The cost of providing any CUSIP or other securities identification numbers for the Notes; and
(n) The fees and expenses of any depository and any nominees thereof in connection with the Notes.
SECTION 10. .
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery
All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Selling Agent or any controlling person of any Selling Agent, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive each delivery of and payment for any of the Notes.
SECTION 11. .
Termination
(a) . This Agreement (excluding any agreement hereunder by a Selling Agent to purchase Notes from the Company as principal) may be terminated for any reason, with respect to one or more, or all, of the Selling Agents, at any time by either the Company or one or more of the Selling Agents upon the giving of 30 days' written notice of such termination to the other party hereto. Any termination by the Company of this Agreement with respect to one or more, but less than all, of the Selling Agents shall be effective with respect to such designated Selling Agents only, and the Agreement will remain in force and effect with respect to any other Selling Agents who remain parties hereto.
Termination of this Agreement
(b) . A Selling Agent may terminate any agreement hereunder by such Selling Agent to purchase Notes as principal, immediately upon notice to the Company at any time prior to the Settlement Date relating thereto, if (i) trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended by the Commission or a national securities exchange, or if trading generally on either the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange shall have been suspended, or minimum or maximum prices for trading
Termination of Agreement to Purchase Notes as Principal
 
have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities have been required, by either of said exchanges or by order of the Commission or any other governmental authority, (ii) there has been, since the date of such agreement, any material adverse change or any development involving a prospective material adverse change in the condition (financial or other), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries the effect of which is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of such Selling Agent, impracticable to market the Notes or enforce contracts for the sale of the Notes, (iii) a material disruption in the commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States has occurred or a banking moratorium shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities, (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or material escalation of hostilities or other calamity or crisis (in the United States or elsewhere) the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in the judgment of such Selling Agent, impracticable to market the Notes or enforce contracts for the sale of the Notes, or (v) since the date of such agreement (x) a downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act, and (y) such an organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities.
(c) . In the event of a termination under this Section 11, or following the Settlement Date in connection with a sale to or through a Selling Agent appointed on a one-time basis, neither party will have any liability to the other party hereto, except that (i) the Selling Agents shall be entitled to any commission earned in accordance with Section 1(c) hereof, (ii) if at the time of termination (A) any Selling Agent shall own any Notes purchased by it as principal with the intention of reselling them or (B) an offer to purchase any of the Notes has been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the purchaser or such purchaser's agent of the Note or Notes relating thereto has not occurred, the covenants set forth in Sections 3 and 6 hereof shall remain in effect until such Notes are so resold or delivered, as the case may be, and (iii) the covenant set forth in Section 3(k) hereof, the provisions of Section 9 hereof, the indemnity and contribution agreements set forth in Sections 7 and 8 hereof, and the provisions of Sections 10, 12, 13, 14 and 15 hereof shall remain in effect.

For the purpose of this Agreement, "Commitment" means, in relation to an Initial Purchaser, the amount set forth opposite its name under the heading Commitment in the applicable table of Schedule 1, to the extent not reduced or terminated under this Agreement.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If any of the foregoing conditions is not satisfied on or before the Settlement Date, this Agreement shall terminate on such date and the parties hereto shall be under no further liability arising out of this Agreement (except for the liability of the Company in relation to expenses as provided in the Distribution Agreement and except for any liability arising before or in relation to such termination), provided that BAS, on behalf of the Initial Purchasers, may in its discretion waive any of the aforesaid conditions or any part of them.
 
The Company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If the sale of any of the Notes provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Selling Agents set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Selling Agents, the Company will reimburse the Selling Agents severally upon demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of such Notes.
 
If any one or more Selling Agents shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Notes agreed to be purchased by such Selling Agent or Selling Agents hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under the Distribution Agreement and/or this Agreement, the remaining Selling Agents shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which they have agreed to purchase such Notes, as the case may be, bear to the aggregate amount of Notes
 
agreed to be purchased by all the remaining Selling Agents) the Notes which the defaulting Selling Agent or Selling Agents agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate amount of Notes which the defaulting Selling Agent or Selling Agents agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Notes that the Selling Agents have agreed to purchase, the remaining Selling Agents shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of such Notes, and if such non-defaulting Selling Agents do not purchase all such Notes, the agreement of the Selling Agents to purchase such Notes will terminate without liability to any non-defaulting Selling Agent or the Company. In the event of a default by any Selling Agent as set forth in this Section 8, the Settlement Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as [Banc of America Securities LLC] [other applicable lead manager] shall determine in order that the required changes in the Disclosure Package or Pricing Supplement or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in the Distribution Agreement or this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Selling Agent of its liability, if any, to the Company and any non-defaulting Selling Agent for damages occasioned by its default.
 
This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which, taken together, shall constitute one and the same agreement and any party may enter into this Agreement by executing a counterpart.
 
This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles of conflict of laws.
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding of our agreement, please sign and return to us the enclosed duplicate hereof, whereupon this letter and your acceptance shall represent a binding agreement among the Company and the several Initial Purchasers.
 
The foregoing Agreement is hereby confirmed and accepted as of the date specified above:

Although we have not independently verified, are not passing upon and assume no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, [the] [any] Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (other than as stated in paragraph 2 above), nothing has come to our attention that has caused us to believe that the remaining portions of the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto as of the time it became effective, as of the Initial Sale Time or as of the date of this opinion, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that, subject to the foregoing with respect to financial statements and other financial, accounting and statistical information, the remaining portions of [the] [each] Disclosure Package, taken as a whole as of the Initial Sale Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statement therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or that, subject to the foregoing with respect to financial statements and other financial, accounting and statistical information, the remaining portions of the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, as of its date or as of the date of this opinion, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

[We express no opinion as to the effect of any possible judicial, administrative or other action giving effect to, or which constitute, the actions of governmental authorities or laws of any country other than the United States of America. In addition, we call your attention to the fact that the Notes are denominated in [euro] [pounds sterling] []. A judgment for money in an action based on securities denominated in foreign currencies in a Federal or state court in the United States ordinarily would be enforced in the United States only in U.S. dollars. The date used to determine the rate of conversion of the foreign currency in which a particular security is denominated into U.S. dollars will depend upon various factors, including the court in which the judgment is entered. We express no opinion as to whether a court would award a judgment in a currency other than U.S. dollars or the particular date or rate of exchange that would be used by such court in the entry of a judgment.]
other specified currency

remaining portions of the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, as of its date or as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

If otherwise agreed, the Notes will be purchased by the applicable Selling Agent(s) as principal(s), and such purchases will be made in accordance with terms agreed upon by the applicable Selling Agent(s) and the Company (which terms shall take the form of a written agreement between the applicable Selling Agent(s) and the Company or an oral agreement between the applicable Selling Agent(s) and the Company, confirmed in writing by those applicable Selling Agent(s) to the Company, each in accordance with the provisions of the Distribution Agreement). Only those provisions in these Administrative Procedures that are applicable to the particular role that a Selling Agent will perform shall apply.
Subject to Section 1(a) of the Distribution Agreement, the Company reserves the right to sell the Notes at any time directly on its own behalf to any unsolicited purchaser, whether directly to such purchaser or through an agent for such purchaser.

The Prospectus also may be supplemented with a "Product Supplement" that describes the general terms for a specific type of Indexed Note and that shall be filed with the SEC and be delivered to investors with the Prospectus and the applicable Pricing Supplement.
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Notes, the Notes will be issued either (a) in book-entry only form and represented by one or more fully registered global Notes without coupons (each, a "Global Note") delivered to the U.S. Issuing and Paying Agent, as custodian for The Depository Trust Corporation ("DTC"), and/or to the London Paying Agent, as custodian for Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear system ("Euroclear") and Clearstream Banking, socit anonyme, Luxembourg ("Clearstream"), and recorded in the book-entry system maintained by DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or (b) in limited circumstances, in certificated registered form (each, a "Certificated Note") delivered to the investor, other purchaser or a person designated by such investor or other purchaser. Owners of beneficial interests in Notes issued in book-entry form (such interests referred to as "Book-Entry Notes") will be entitled to physical delivery of Notes in certificated form equal in principal amount to their respective beneficial interests only under the limited circumstances described in the Indentures and the applicable Notes.
 
General procedures relating to the issuance of all Notes are set forth in Part I. Book-Entry Notes will be issued in accordance with the procedures set forth in Part II. In the event Certificated Notes are issued, the parties will agree on the necessary and appropriate issuance procedures at the time of issuance of such Certificated Notes.

However, unless otherwise specified in the Pricing Supplement, if this Note has as its Base Rate LIBOR or EURIBOR, as described below, if an Interest Payment Date falls on a date that is not a Business Day, and the next Business Day is in the next calendar month, the Interest Payment Date will be the immediately preceding Business Day. In each such case, except for the Interest Payment Date falling on the Maturity Date, the Interest Periods and the Interest Reset Dates will be adjusted accordingly to calculate the amount of interest payable on this Note. Unless otherwise specified in the Pricing Supplement, if the Maturity Date of this Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the related payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, this Note will be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date such payments were due, and no additional interest will accrue in respect of the amount so payable for the period from and after the Maturity Date.

The accrued interest factor is the sum of the interest factors calculated for each day in the period for which accrued interest is being calculated. Unless otherwise indicated in the Pricing Supplement, the daily interest factor will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months if the Day Count Convention specified in the Pricing Supplement is "30/360" for the period specified thereunder, or on the basis of the actual number of days in the Interest Period divided by 360 if the Day Count Convention specified in the Pricing Supplement is "Actual/360" for the period specified thereunder, or on the basis of the actual number of days in the Interest Period divided by 365, or in the case of an Interest Payment Date falling in a leap year, 366, if the Day Count Convention specified in the Pricing Supplement is "Actual/Actual" for the period specified thereunder. If no Day Count Convention is specified in the Pricing Supplement, the daily interest factor will be computed and interest will be paid (including payments for partial periods) as follows: (i) for Notes that have as a Base Rate the federal funds rate, LIBOR, EURIBOR, the prime rate, or any other rate other than the treasury rate, as if "Actual/360" had been specified in the Pricing Supplement; (ii) for Notes that have the treasury rate as a Base Rate, as if "Actual/Actual" had been specified in the Pricing Supplement; and (iii) for Notes that are denominated in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise specified in the Pricing Supplement, as if "Actual/365" had been specified in the Pricing Supplement.
All amounts used in or resulting from any calculation on this Note will be rounded to the nearest cent, if the currency specified on the face hereof (referred to herein as the "Specified
 
Currency") is U.S. dollars, or to the nearest corresponding hundredth of a unit, if the Specified Currency is other than U.S. dollars, with one-half cent or one-half of a corresponding hundredth of a unit or more being rounded upward.

Defeasance
SECTION 15. . Unless otherwise provided herein or in the Pricing Supplement, the principal, premium, if any, and interest on this Note are payable in the Specified Currency indicated on the face hereof (or, if such Specified Currency is not at the time of such payment legal tender for the payment of public and private debts, in (a) such other coin or currency of the country that issued such Specified Currency or (b) (if such Specified Currency is the euro) the successor currency under applicable law, in each case as at the time of such payment is legal tender for the payment of debts).
Specified Currency
In the event the Specified Currency indicated on the face hereof has been replaced by another currency (a "Replacement Currency"), any amount due pursuant to this Note may be repaid, at the option of the Issuer, in the Replacement Currency or in U.S. dollars, at a rate of exchange which takes into account the conversion, at the rate prevailing on the most recent date
 
 
on which official conversion rates were quoted or set by the national government or other authority responsible for issuing the Replacement Currency, from the Specified Currency to the Replacement Currency and, if necessary, the conversion of the Replacement Currency into U.S. dollars at the rate prevailing on the date of such conversion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this Note originally was issued in a domestic currency of a state that is or subsequently becomes a Member State of the European Union, then this Note may be redenominated in euro, if subsequent to the issuance of this Note, such state participates in the European monetary union. This Note may be redenominated as a matter of law whether or not the Pricing Supplement provides for redenomination.
If the Specified Currency indicated on the face hereof is other than U.S. dollars (referred to in this Section 15 as a "Foreign Currency"), the Issuer generally will pay principal, premium (if any), interest and other amounts payable (if any) in the Foreign Currency. Holders of beneficial interests in this Note through a participant in DTC (other than Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg) will receive payments in U.S. dollars, regardless of the Foreign Currency, unless those holders elect to receive payments on this Note in the Foreign Currency, which election shall be made pursuant to procedures and arrangements in place between DTC and its participants. DTC shall notify the Trustee of any such election in accordance with arrangements in place between DTC and the Trustee.
If holders of beneficial interests in this Note do not elect to receive payments in the Foreign Currency, the Trustee or an affiliate or other agent of the Trustee performing currency exchange transactions and procedures on its behalf (collectively referred to herein as the "Exchange Agent") will convert any payments due to those holders of beneficial interests in this Note into U.S. dollars. The U.S. dollar amount of any such payment shall be the amount of the Foreign Currency otherwise payable converted into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate, determined as described below. All costs of those conversions will be shared pro rata among the holders of beneficial interests not electing to receive payments in the Foreign Currency in proportion to their respective holdings by deduction from the applicable payments.
The conversion described above will be made by the Exchange Agent using the exchange rate for the Foreign Currency into U.S. dollars prevailing as of 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day (in Charlotte, North Carolina and New York City) prior to the relevant payment date. If the applicable exchange rate quotation is unavailable from the entity or source ordinarily used by the Exchange Agent in the normal course of business, the Exchange Agent will obtain a quotation from a leading foreign exchange bank in New York City, which may be an affiliate of the Trustee or another entity selected by the Trustee for that purpose after consultation with the Issuer. If no quotation is available from a leading foreign exchange bank, payment will be made in the applicable Foreign Currency to the account or accounts specified by DTC to the Trustee, unless the applicable Foreign Currency is unavailable as described below.
If the Issuer determines that a payment hereon cannot be made in the Foreign Currency, due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Issuer's control, or the Foreign Currency is unavailable because that currency is no longer used by the government of the relevant country or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, such payment will be made in U.S. dollars. The Trustee and/or
 
the London Paying Agent, on receipt of the Issuer's written instructions and at the Issuer's expense, will give prompt notice to the beneficial holders of this Note if such determination is made. The U.S. dollar amount of any payment described in this paragraph shall be the amount of the Foreign Currency otherwise payable converted into U.S. dollars using the most recently available market exchange rate for the applicable Foreign Currency.
Any payment made under such circumstances in U.S. dollars, where the payment is required to be made in the Foreign Currency, will not constitute an "Event of Default" with respect to this Note.
SECTION 16. . If this Note is identified as an Original Issue Discount Note in the Pricing Supplement, then unless otherwise specified therein, the amount payable to the holder of this Note in the event of redemption, repayment or acceleration of Maturity will be the Amortized Face Amount of this Note (as defined below) as of the date of such event. The "Amortized Face Amount" shall be the amount equal to (a) the Issue Price (as set forth in the Pricing Supplement) plus (b) the original issue discount amortized from the Original Issue Date to the date as of which the Amortized Face Amount is calculated, as specified in the Pricing Supplement.

Upon the issuance of any substituted Note, the Issuer may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover all expenses and reasonable charges connected with the preparation and delivery of a new Note. If any Note which has matured or has been redeemed or repaid or is about to mature or to be redeemed or repaid shall become mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen, the Issuer may, instead of issuing a substitute Note, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated or defaced Note) upon compliance by the holder with the provisions of this paragraph.

The election notice must be delivered to the [Trustee] [London Paying Agent] no later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the last Business Day in the Election Notice Period. Upon delivery to the [Trustee] [London Paying Agent] of a notice of election to extend the Maturity Date of the Notes or any portion thereof during any Election Notice Period, that election will be revocable during each day of that Election Notice Period, until [12:00 noon, New York City time,] on the last Business Day in the applicable Election Notice Period, at which time the notice will become irrevocable.
                    
If on any Election Date, the registered holder of this Note does not make a timely or proper election to extend the Maturity Date of all or any portion of the principal amount of this Note, the principal amount of this Note for which an election has not been made will become due and payable on the Initial Maturity Date, or the applicable Additional Maturity Date to which the Maturity of this Note has previously been extended, as applicable. The principal amount of this Note for which an election is not exercised will be represented by a non-extendible substitute note, [substantially in the form attached hereto as Annex A,]
7
which will be completed by the [Trustee] [London Paying Agent] in consultation with the Issuer, and issued by the [Trustee] [London Paying Agent] in the name of the holder hereof on that Election Date in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, subject to the delivery of this Note to the [Trustee] [London Paying Agent]. In such a case, Schedule 1 hereto will be annotated as of that Election Date to reflect the corresponding decrease in the principal amount of this Note. The non-extendible substitute note so issued will have the same terms as this Note, except that such note:
 
 
 
Interest on a non-extendible substitute note will accrue from, and including, the last Interest Payment Date on this Note as to which interest was duly paid or provided by the Issuer.
The failure to elect to extend the Maturity Date of all or any portion of this Note will be irrevocable, and will be binding upon any subsequent holder of this Note or any applicable replacement note. The holder of a non-extendible substitute note received as a consequence of the failure to make such an election may not elect to exchange that non-extendible substitute note for an interest in this Note. The Issuer and the [Trustee] [London Paying Agent] will deem this
 
 
Note cancelled as to any portion of the principal amount hereof for which a duly completed form of notice of election to extend the Maturity Date and, if applicable, this Note are not delivered to the [Trustee] [London Paying Agent] within the applicable Election Notice Period in accordance with the terms of this Note.
The undersigned hereby elects to extend the Maturity Date of the Bank of America Corporation [] (CUSIP Number [ISIN and Common Code ]) (or the portion thereof specified below) with the effect provided in the Note by surrendering such Note to the [the Trustee at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York, 10286] [the London Paying Agent at One Canada Square, London, E14 5AL,], or such other address of which the Issuer shall from time to time notify the registered holders of the Note, in the event of an election to extend the Maturity Date of only a portion of the principal amount of the Note, together with this form of "Notice of Election to Extend Maturity Date" duly completed by the holder.

Such notice shall be irrevocable. Thereafter, this Note will bear such higher interest rate for the Extension Period.
[If the Issuer elects to extend the maturity hereof, the registered holder hereof will have the option to elect repayment hereof in whole or in part by the Issuer on the Existing Maturity Date then in effect at a price equal to the principal amount hereof plus any accrued and unpaid interest to such date.

The interest rate in effect during an Interest Period will be the rate determined by the Calculation Agent specified in the Pricing Supplement on the "calculation date" by reference to the Interest Determination Date (as described below).
The "calculation date" pertaining to any Interest Determination Date will be the date by which the Calculation Agent specified in the Pricing Supplement computes the amount of interest owed on this Note for the related Interest Period. Unless otherwise specified in the Pricing Supplement, the "calculation date" will be the earlier of (a) the tenth calendar day after the related Interest Determination Date or, if that date is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day; or (b) the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or the Stated Maturity Date or the date of redemption or the date of prepayment, as the case may be.
The interest rate in effect on each day shall be (a) if such day is an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date pertaining to such Interest Reset Date or (b) if such day is not an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the immediately preceding Interest Reset Date. Unless otherwise specified herein or in the Pricing Supplement, if any Interest Reset Date specified in the Pricing Supplement (including the Initial Interest Reset Date, as specified in the Pricing Supplement) falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that, unless otherwise specified in the Pricing Supplement, in the case of a LIBOR note or a EURIBOR note, if the next Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, the Interest Reset Date will be the immediately preceding Business Day.

further
For a Note whose interest rate is determined by reference to two or more Base Rates, unless otherwise specified in the Pricing Supplement, the "Interest Determination Date" shall be the most recent Business Day that is at least two Business Days prior to the applicable Interest Reset Date for the Note on which each Base Rate is determinable.
Unless otherwise specified in the Pricing Supplement, if any Interest Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the related payment of interest will be made on the next succeeding Business Day. However, unless otherwise specified in the Pricing Supplement, if this Note has as its Base Rate LIBOR or EURIBOR, as described below, if an Interest Payment Date falls on a date that is not a Business Day, and the next Business Day is in the next calendar month, the Interest Payment Date will be the immediately preceding Business Day. In each such case, except for the Interest Payment Date falling on the Maturity Date, the Interest Periods and the Interest Reset Dates will be adjusted accordingly to calculate the amount of interest payable on this Note. Unless otherwise specified in the Pricing Supplement, if the Maturity Date of this Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the related payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, this Note will be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date such payments were due, and no additional interest will accrue in respect of the amount so payable for the period from and after the Maturity Date.
Accrued interest on this Note is calculated by multiplying the principal amount of the Note by an accrued interest factor. The accrued interest factor is the sum of the interest factors calculated for each day in the period for which accrued interest is being calculated. Unless otherwise indicated in the Pricing Supplement, the daily interest factor will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months if the Day Count Convention specified in the Pricing Supplement is "30/360" for the period specified thereunder, or on the basis of the actual number of days in the Interest Period divided by 360 if the Day Count Convention specified in the Pricing Supplement is "Actual/360" for the period specified thereunder, or on the basis of the actual number of days in the Interest Period divided by 365, or in the case of an Interest Payment Date falling in a leap year, 366, if the Day Count Convention specified in the Pricing Supplement is "Actual/Actual" for the period specified thereunder. If no Day Count Convention is specified in the Pricing Supplement, the daily interest factor will be computed and interest will be paid (including payments for partial periods) as follows: (i) for Notes that have as a Base Rate the federal funds rate, LIBOR, EURIBOR, the prime rate, or any other rate other than the treasury rate, as if "Actual/360" had been specified in the Pricing Supplement; (ii) for Notes that have the treasury rate as a Base Rate, as if "Actual/Actual" had been specified in the Pricing Supplement; and (iii) for Notes that are denominated in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise specified in the Pricing Supplement, as if "Actual/365" had been specified in the Pricing Supplement.
All amounts used in or resulting from any calculation on this Note will be rounded to the nearest cent, if the currency specified on the face hereof (referred to herein as the "Specified
 
Currency") is U.S. dollars, or to the nearest corresponding hundredth of a unit, if the Specified Currency is other than U.S. dollars, with one-half cent or one-half of a corresponding hundredth of a unit or more being rounded upward. Unless otherwise specified in the Pricing Supplement, all percentages resulting from any calculation are rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percent, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward.

SECTION 16. . Unless otherwise provided herein or in the Pricing Supplement, the principal, premium, if any, and interest on this Note are payable in the Specified Currency indicated on the face hereof (or, if such Specified Currency is not at the time of such payment legal tender for the payment of public and private debts, in (a) such other coin or currency of the country that issued such Specified Currency or (b) (if such Specified Currency is the euro) the successor currency under applicable law, in each case as at the time of such payment is legal tender for the payment of debts).
Specified Currency
 
 
In the event the Specified Currency indicated on the face hereof has been replaced by another currency (a "Replacement Currency"), any amount due pursuant to this Note may be repaid, at the option of the Issuer, in the Replacement Currency or in U.S. dollars, at a rate of exchange which takes into account the conversion, at the rate prevailing on the most recent date on which official conversion rates were quoted or set by the national government or other authority responsible for issuing the Replacement Currency, from the Specified Currency to the Replacement Currency and, if necessary, the conversion of the Replacement Currency into U.S. dollars at the rate prevailing on the date of such conversion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this Note originally was issued in a domestic currency of a state that is or subsequently becomes a Member State of the European Union, then this Note may be redenominated in euro, if subsequent to the issuance of this Note, such state participates in the European monetary union. This Note may be redenominated as a matter of law whether or not the Pricing Supplement provides for redenomination.
If the Specified Currency indicated on the face hereof is other than U.S. dollars (referred to in this Section 16 as a "Foreign Currency"), the Issuer generally will pay principal, premium (if any), interest and other amounts payable (if any) in the Foreign Currency. Holders of beneficial interests in this Note through a participant in DTC (other than Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg) will receive payments in U.S. dollars, regardless of the Foreign Currency, unless those holders elect to receive payments on this Note in the Foreign Currency, which election shall be made pursuant to procedures and arrangements in place between DTC and its participants. DTC shall notify the Trustee of any such election in accordance with arrangements in place between DTC and the Trustee.
If holders of beneficial interests in this Note do not elect to receive payments in the Foreign Currency, the Trustee or an affiliate or other agent of the Trustee performing currency exchange transactions and procedures on its behalf (collectively referred to herein as the "Exchange Agent") will convert any payments due to those holders of beneficial interests in this Note into U.S. dollars. The U.S. dollar amount of any such payment shall be the amount of the Foreign Currency otherwise payable converted into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate, determined as described below. All costs of those conversions will be shared pro rata among the holders of beneficial interests not electing to receive payments in the Foreign Currency in proportion to their respective holdings by deduction from the applicable payments.
The conversion described above will be made by the Exchange Agent using the exchange rate for the Foreign Currency into U.S. dollars prevailing as of 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day (in Charlotte, North Carolina and New York City) prior to the relevant payment date. If the applicable exchange rate quotation is unavailable from the entity or source ordinarily used by the Exchange Agent in the normal course of business, the Exchange Agent will obtain a quotation from a leading foreign exchange bank in New York City, which may be an affiliate of the Trustee or another entity selected by the Trustee for that purpose after consultation with the Issuer. If no quotation is available from a leading foreign exchange bank, payment will be made in the applicable Foreign Currency to the account or accounts specified by DTC to the Trustee, unless the applicable Foreign Currency is unavailable as described below.

We hereby consent to be named in the Registration Statement as attorneys who passed upon the legality of the Medium-Term Notes and to the filing of a copy of this opinion as part of the Corporation's Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed for the purpose of including this opinion as part of the Registration Statement.
