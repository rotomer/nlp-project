CHARLOTTE  Bank of America Corporation today reported first-quarter 2008 net income declined to $1.21 billion from $5.26 billion a year earlier. Diluted earnings per share fell 80 percent to $0.23 from $1.16 in the same period in 2007.
"Despite revenue growth in most of our businesses, these results clearly did not meet our expectations," said Kenneth D. Lewis, chairman and chief executive officer. "The weakness in the economy and prolonged disruptions in the capital markets took their toll on our performance. That said, we are continuing to invest in growth initiatives across the company, and believe our core strengthsincluding our diverse income stream, liquidity and capitalput us in a strong position to withstand the jolts to the system and emerge even stronger when conditions improve."
With regard to the outlook for the U.S. economy, Lewis noted that gross domestic product (GDP) growth is expected to be minimal at best in the second quarter, with a slight pickup in the second half of the year.
"Our earnings power from our core business activities is strong and growing," Lewis added. "We are bringing innovative new products to market, taking market share and expanding customer relationships across the company. Nevertheless, we remain concerned about the health of the consumer given the prolonged housing slump, subprime issues, employment levels and higher fuel and food prices."

First Quarter 2008 Financial Summary
Revenue and Expense
Revenue net of interest expense on a fully taxable-equivalent basis declined 6 percent to $17.30 billion from $18.48 billion in the first quarter a year earlier.
Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis rose 20 percent to $10.29 billion from $8.60 billion in the first quarter of 2007 on strong loan growth; an increase from market-based net interest income; and the addition of LaSalle. The increase was partially offset by higher funding costs. The net interest yield improved 12 basis points to 2.73 percent.
Results shown are defined by Global Wealth and Investment Management's calculation of the percentage of assets under management in the top two quartiles of categories based on Morningstar as of March 31, 2008. The category percentile rank was calculated by ranking the one and three year net returns of share classes within the categories. The assets of the number of funds within the top 2 quartile results were added and then divided by Columbia Management's total equity fund assets under management. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The share class earning the ranking may have limited eligibility and may not be available to all investors.

Noninterest income declined 29 percent to $7.01 billion from $9.89 billion a year earlier. Increases in service charges, card income, mortgage-banking income and investment and brokerage services were more than offset by trading account losses and lower other income related to CDO writedowns. Equity investment income remained essentially unchanged as the gain from the Visa, Inc. initial public offering was offset by reductions in Principal Investing gains.
Noninterest expense was relatively flat compared to a year earlier as lower personnel expenses and the reversal of litigation costs related to Visa were offset by modest increases in most other expense categories. Pretax merger and restructuring charges related to acquisitions were $170 million compared with $111 million a year earlier due to the addition of U.S. Trust and LaSalle.
Credit Quality
Credit quality deteriorated from more favorable levels experienced in the first half of 2007. Weak markets, particularly geographic regions that have experienced the most significant home price declines, and the slowing economy resulted in credit deterioration in several portfolios particularly home equity, small business and homebuilders.
Provision expense rose $4.78 billion from the year-ago period mainly because of additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses in consumer and commercial portfolios directly tied to housing. Portfolio seasoning and the impact of a slowing economy on domestic consumer and small business portfolios also drove reserve additions compared with reductions a year earlier from securitization activities and the sale of a portfolio. Net charge-offs increased $1.29 billion from a year ago, also reflecting housing market deterioration and slowing economic conditions.

Capital Management
Total shareholders' equity was $156.31 billion at March 31. Period-end assets were $1.74 trillion. The Tier 1 Capital ratio was 7.51 percent, up from 6.87 percent at December 31, 2007 after the company raised about $13 billion in capital through the issuance of preferred stock in January. The Tier 1 ratio was 8.57 percent in the year ago quarter.
Bank of America paid a cash dividend of $0.64 per share in the quarter. The company also issued about 15 million common shares primarily related to restricted stock activity and did not repurchase any shares. Period-end common shares issued and outstanding were 4.45 billion for the first quarter of 2008 and 4.44 billion for the fourth and first quarters of 2007.

Managed net revenue rose 17 percent as mortgage banking income more than doubled and both card income and service charges increased 14 percent helping generate a 30 percent increase in noninterest income.
Net income fell 59 percent from a year ago, as credit costs rose and expenses increased 10 percent.
The provision for credit losses increased by $4.04 billion to $6.45 billion compared with a year ago. The increase was due to reserve additions for home equity reflecting the impacts of housing weakness and the slowing economy, as well as seasoning of the consumer portfolios and deterioration in the small business portfolio. Net losses increased $1.25 billion to $3.69 billion, reflecting housing market deterioration and weakened economic conditions.

Net revenue decreased 41 percent and net income fell 92 percent on CDO and leveraged finance-related writedowns. Also impacting net income was an increase in credit costs offset in part by a decline in noninterest expense.
The provision for credit losses increased $408 million to $523 million. The impact of the housing market slowdown on the homebuilder loan portfolio drove additions to the credit loss reserves and higher net charge-offs. Higher net charge-offs related to seasoning of the dealer-related retail portfolios, and modest increases in middle market net charge-offs from very low prior year levels also contributed to the increased provision.

Net revenue in Global Wealth and Investment Management increased 8 percent. Asset management fees rose 39 percent to $899 million mainly from the addition of U.S. Trust and LaSalle. The increase was offset by a $220 million loss related to support provided to certain cash funds.
Net income declined 54 percent as noninterest expense rose 35 percent due mainly to the additions of U.S. Trust and LaSalle combined with increased expenses related to the retirement and mass affluent initiatives. Provision for credit losses increased to $243 million from $23 million a year ago due to deterioration in the home equity portfolio from housing market weakness.

All Other recorded a net loss of $223 million compared to net income of $615 million in the year earlier period. The decline was mainly due to lower equity investment income in Principal Investing and the absence of earnings from certain liquidated businesses when compared to last year. These decreases were partially offset by increases in gains on sales of debt securities and lower expenses related to stock-based compensation granted to retirement-eligible employees.

For the one, five and ten year periods ended 12/31/07, our fund family ranked 19 (of 67 fund families), 1 (of 61 fund families) and 17 (of 52 fund families) in the annual Lipper/ Fund Families Survey. Mutual funds are advised by Columbia Management, the primary investment management division of Bank of America Corporation. Lipper calculated the returns of each fund, adjusted for 12b-1 fees and sales charges, and gave it a preliminary ranking, or percentile, in its category measuring how it compared with all peers tracked by Lipper. The percentile ranking was then weighted by asset size relative to the fund family's other assets in its general classification, e.g. world equity. This score was then multiplied by the weighting of its general classification, as determined by the entire Lipper universe of funds. Had 12b-1 fees or sales loads been included, rankings would have been lower.

Fully taxable-equivalent basis data
 
Reconciliation to GAAP financial measures
Supplemental financial data presented on an operating basis is a basis of presentation not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) that excludes merger and restructuring charges. We believe that the exclusion of merger and restructuring charges, which represent events outside our normal operations, provides a meaningful period-to-period comparison and is more reflective of normalized operations.
Return on average common shareholders' equity and return on average tangible shareholders' equity utilize non-GAAP allocation methodologies. Return on average common shareholders' equity measures the earnings contribution of a unit as a percentage of the shareholders' equity allocated to that unit. Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures the earnings contribution of the Corporation as a percentage of shareholders' equity reduced by goodwill. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity (i.e., capital) at the individual unit level and are integral components in the analytics for resource allocation. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue. We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation.
Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. See the tables below for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations
to GAAP financial measures for the quarters ended March 31, 2008, December 31, 2007, September 30, 2007, June 30, 2007 and March 31, 2007.
