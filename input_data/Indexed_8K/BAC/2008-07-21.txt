CHARLOTTE  Bank of America Corporation today reported second-quarter 2008 net income of $3.41 billion, down from a record $5.76 billion a year earlier. Diluted earnings per share decreased 44 percent to $0.72 from $1.28 in the same period in 2007. Net revenue rose to a record $20.32 billion. Earnings available to common shareholders totaled $3.22 billion.
Net income in the period rose from $1.21 billion, or $0.23 per share, in the first quarter of 2008. Second-quarter net income included pretax merger and restructuring costs of $212 million.
"We are pleased with these solid results in a difficult financial environment," said Kenneth D. Lewis, chairman and chief executive officer. "Outside of real estate-related products, our operating results were quite good virtually across all business segments. This performance demonstrates not only the advantages of our company's diversity and scale, but also the ability of our associates to differentiate Bank of America in the eyes of customers and clients."

Second Quarter 2008 Financial Summary
Revenue and Expense
Revenue net of interest expense on a fully taxable-equivalent basis rose 3 percent to a record $20.63 billion from $20.02 billion a year earlier and was $3.33 billion higher than the first quarter of 2008.
Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis rose 25 percent to $10.94 billion from $8.78 billion in the second quarter of 2007 driven by improved margins in the current rate environment combined with loan growth and the acquisition of LaSalle. The net interest yield improved 33 basis points to 2.92 percent.

Page 3
Noninterest income declined 14 percent to $9.69 billion from $11.24 billion a year earlier. Service charges, mortgage banking income and investment and brokerage services income increased. These increases were offset by writedowns of $1.22 billion related to market disruptions, which compared with $2.81 billion in writedowns during the first quarter, as well as lower equity investment income.
Noninterest expense rose 4 percent to $9.56 billion from a year earlier mainly because of the addition of LaSalle and U.S. Trust partially offset by lower personnel costs. Pretax merger and restructuring charges related to acquisitions were $212 million compared with $75 million a year earlier. The efficiency ratio was 47.08 percent.
Credit Quality
Credit quality continued to weaken, particularly in markets that experienced the most significant home price declines. The slowing economy resulted in credit deterioration concentrated in the domestic consumer, small business and homebuilder portfolios. Both net charge-offs and nonperforming assets continued to increase.
Provision expense rose $4.02 billion from a year ago to $5.83 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $3.62 billion and additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses of $2.21 billion. The additions were mainly in consumer and commercial portfolios directly tied to housing, including home equity, residential mortgage and homebuilders. The company has added $7.29 billion to the reserve through increased provision over the past 12 months. Amounts shown below for the quarter ended or as of June 30, 2007 do not include LaSalle.

Capital Management
Total shareholders' equity was $162.69 billion at June 30. Period-end assets were $1.72 trillion. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.25 percent, up from 7.51 percent at March 31, 2008 after the company raised about $7 billion in capital through the issuance of preferred stock. The Tier 1 ratio was 8.52 percent a year earlier.
Bank of America paid a cash dividend of $0.64 per share in the quarter. The company also issued about 137,000 common shares mostly related to employee stock options and ownership plans and did not repurchase any shares. Period-end common shares issued and outstanding were 4.45 billion for the first and second quarters of 2008 and 4.44 billion in the year ago quarter.
Countrywide Financial Acquisition
(Results are not part of Bank of America second-quarter results)
Countrywide Financial Corporation, which was acquired on July 1, will make Bank of America the leader in providing home financing to American consumers.
Countrywide had a second-quarter net loss of $2.33 billion, including just under $4 billion in credit-related losses. Because purchase accounting records certain assets and liabilities at fair value, which includes an estimate of future credit costs, for those items recorded at fair value such costs would not generally run through future income statements.
The transaction immediately adds to Bank of America profit. It is now expected to be accretive in 2008. When the acquisition was announced in January, Bank of America estimated Countrywide's addition would be neutral toward per-share earnings this year.
The estimated cost savings have been significantly increased from the after-tax $670 million projected in January. Management will provide details on adjustments being made under purchase accounting, the new cost savings targets and other financial issues on a teleconference later today.
(See details below).
Bank of America is continuing the trend begun by Countrywide earlier this year to expand loan modification and workout resources to address foreclosure issues. Through June, Countrywide has worked out 119,000 loans, nearly twice the number of its completed foreclosures. Bank of America estimates it will restructure about $40 billion in home loans during the next two years, enabling more than 265,000 families to stay in their homes.

The combined mortgage business will continue to offer conforming loans underwritten to standard guidelines of government-sponsored enterprises, including FHA and VA loans and other loans designed for low-and moderate-income borrowers. The company has discontinued originating subprime and certain other nontraditional home loans, including option-ARMs, and will generally use Bank of America's product suite, which has performed much better in the current credit environment.

Net income fell 66 percent from a year ago, as credit costs rose.
Managed net revenue rose 11 percent. Net interest income increased 13 percent to $8.02 billion driven by growth in average loans and deposits and margin improvement. Noninterest income rose 8 percent to $5.08 billion on higher mortgage banking income and service charges.
The provision for credit losses increased by $3.45 billion to $6.55 billion compared with a year earlier. Net losses rose $2.06 billion to $4.72 billion, reflecting the impact of housing market deterioration and weakened economic conditions on consumer real estate, small business and other domestic consumer portfolios. Loan loss reserve additions for home equity and deterioration and seasoning of the consumer portfolios also contributed to higher credit costs.

Net revenue rose slightly on a 47 percent increase in net interest income, offset by a 36 percent decline in noninterest income due mainly to writedowns related to market disruptions of $1.22 billion compared with $2.81 billion in the first quarter. Near-record investment banking income partially offset these writedowns. CDO-related writedowns were $645 million in the quarter, down significantly from $1.47 billion in the first quarter of 2008. Leveraged-loan writedowns were $64 million, lower than the $439 million in the first quarter.
The provision for credit losses increased $321 million to $363 million as deterioration in the housing market drove higher commercial real estate net charge-offs, mainly in homebuilders, and led to reserve additions. A modest increase in commercial domestic net charge-offs from lower levels a year earlier and increased net charge-offs in dealer-related retail portfolios due to deterioration and seasoning also contributed to the increased provision.

Net income was largely flat at $573 million.
Net revenue increased 21 percent from the addition of U.S. Trust and LaSalle, organic loan and deposit growth and an improving interest rate environment. The increase was partially offset by support to certain cash funds of $36 million, which declined from $220 million in the first quarter of 2008.
Provision for credit losses increased to $119 million compared with a benefit of $13 million a year ago as deterioration in the home equity portfolio from housing market weakness continued.

All Other had net income of $279 million compared with $1.07 billion as equity investment income fell because of the absence of the gain recognized a year earlier from the sale of private equity funds to Conversus Capital, higher credit costs in the residential mortgage portfolio and higher merger and restructuring charges related to LaSalle and U.S. Trust. This was partially offset by a gain on the sale of debt securities.

(Dollars in millions)
The Corporation reports results, specifically , on a managed basis. This basis of presentation excludes the Corporation's securitized mortgage and home equity portfolios for which the Corporation retains servicing. Reporting on a managed basis is consistent with the way that management evaluates the results of . Managed basis assumes that securitized loans were not sold and presents earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold (i.e., held loans) are presented. Loan securitization is an alternative funding process that is used by the Corporation to diversify funding sources. Loan securitization removes loans from the Consolidated Balance Sheet through the sale of loans to an off-balance sheet qualified special purpose entity which is excluded from the Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).

The performance of the managed portfolio is important in understanding and results as it demonstrates the results of the entire portfolio serviced by the business. Securitized loans continue to be serviced by the business and are subject to the same underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring as held loans. In addition, retained excess servicing income is exposed to similar credit risk and repricing of interest rates as held loans. managed income statement line items differ from a held basis reported as follows:

Fully taxable-equivalent basis data
 
Reconciliation to GAAP financial measures
Supplemental financial data presented on an operating basis is a basis of presentation not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) that excludes merger and restructuring charges. We believe that the exclusion of merger and restructuring charges, which represent events outside our normal operations, provides a meaningful period-to-period comparison and is more reflective of normalized operations.
Return on average common shareholders' equity and return on average tangible shareholders' equity utilize non-GAAP allocation methodologies. Return on average common shareholders' equity measures the earnings contribution of a unit as a percentage of the shareholders' equity allocated to that unit. Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures the earnings contribution of the Corporation as a percentage of shareholders' equity reduced by goodwill. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity (i.e., capital) at the individual unit level and are integral components in the analytics for resource allocation. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue. We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation.
Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. See the tables below for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the three months ended June 30, 2008, March 31, 2008, December 31, 2007, September 30, 2007 and June 30, 2007, and the six months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007.
