(1) Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Final Terms, on or after the Exchange Date interests in a Bearer Global Note will be exchangeable for Bearer Definitive Notes with Coupons attached: (i) as to Bearer Permanent Global Notes, on not less than 60 calendar days' written notice from Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg (acting on the instructions of any holder of an interest in the applicable Bearer Permanent Global Note), (ii) if an Event of Default (as defined in the Terms and Conditions) occurs and is continuing, (iii) if the Issuer is notified that either Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg has been closed for business for a continuous period of 14 calendar days (other than by reason of holiday, statutory or otherwise) after the original issuance of the Bearer Notes or has announced an intention permanently to cease business or has in fact done so and no alternative clearance system approved by the Noteholders is available, or (iv) if the Issuer, after notice to the Principal Agent, determines to issue the applicable Bearer Notes in definitive form. Upon the occurrence of these events, the Principal Agent shall deliver the relevant Bearer Definitive Note(s) in accordance with the terms of the relevant Bearer Global Note. For this purpose, the Principal Agent is hereby authorized on behalf of the Issuer:
(a) to authenticate such Bearer Definitive Note(s) in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; and
(b) to deliver such Bearer Definitive Note(s) to or to the order of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg in exchange for such Bearer Global Note.
The Principal Agent shall notify the Issuer forthwith upon receipt of a request for issue of Bearer Definitive Note(s) in accordance with the provisions of a Bearer Global Note and this Agreement (and the aggregate principal amount of such Bearer Temporary Global Note or Bearer Permanent Global Note, as the case may be, to be exchanged in connection therewith).
(2) Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Final Terms, interests in a Registered Global Note will be exchangeable for Registered Definitive Notes: (i) if the Issuer is notified that Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg has been closed for business for a continuous period of 14 calendar days (other than by reason of holiday, statutory or otherwise) after the issuance of the Registered Global Note or has announced an intention permanently to cease business or has in fact done so and no alternative clearance system approved by the Noteholders is available, (ii) if an Event of Default (as defined in the Terms and Conditions) occurs and is continuing, or (iii) if the Issuer, after notice to the Principal Agent, determines to issue the applicable Registered Notes in definitive form. Upon the occurrence of these events, the Principal Agent shall deliver the relevant Registered Definitive Certificates in accordance with the terms of the relevant Registered Global Note. For this purpose, the Registrar is hereby authorized on behalf of the Issuer:
(a) to authenticate such Registered Definitive Certificates in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; and
 
(b) to deliver such Registered Definitive Certificates to or to the order of Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or any alternative clearing system in exchange for such Registered Global Certificate.
(3) The Issuer undertakes to deliver to the Principal Agent and the Registrar sufficient numbers of executed Bearer Definitive Notes with, if applicable, Receipts, Coupons and Talons attached, and sufficient numbers of Registered Definitive Certificates to enable the Principal Agent and the Registrar to comply with their respective obligations under this Clause 7.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Principal Agent shall not deliver a Bearer Definitive Note unless a certification of non-U.S. beneficial ownership is furnished or has previously been received. Any such certification shall contain all certifications and information set forth in the form set out in Schedule 7 hereto, and shall be retained by the Principal Agent, and a copy shall be furnished to the Issuer, in accordance with Clause 6(1)(c) above.
 
(1) The Principal Agent and Registrar shall cause all Bearer Temporary Global Notes, Bearer Permanent Global Notes, Bearer Definitive Notes, Registered Global Certificates and Registered Definitive Certificates that are delivered to and held by it under this Agreement to be maintained in safe custody and shall ensure that such Notes are issued only in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the relevant Global Note and the Terms and Conditions.
(2) Subject to the procedures set out in the Procedures Memorandum, for the purposes of Clause 5(1), the Principal Agent and Registrar are entitled to treat a telephone, , email or facsimile communication from a person purporting to be (and who the Principal Agent or Registrar believes in good faith to be) the authorized representative of the Issuer named in the lists referred to in, or notified pursuant to, Clause 21(7) as sufficient instructions and authority of the Issuer for the Principal Agent or Registrar, as applicable, to act in accordance with Clause 5(l).
(3) If a person who has signed on behalf of the Issuer any Bearer Note or Registered Certificate not yet issued but held by the Principal Agent or Registrar in accordance with Clause 5(1) ceases to be authorized as described in Clause 21(7), the Principal Agent or Registrar, as applicable (unless the Issuer gives notice to the Principal Agent or Registrar, as applicable, that Notes signed by that person do not constitute valid and binding obligations of the Issuer or otherwise until replacements have been provided to the Principal Agent or Registrar, as applicable), shall continue to have authority to issue any such Notes, and the Issuer hereby warrants to the Principal Agent and Registrar that such Notes shall be, unless notified as aforesaid, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer. Promptly upon such person ceasing to be authorized, the Issuer shall provide the Principal Agent with replacement Bearer Notes or Registered Certificates (as applicable). Upon receipt of such replacement Bearer Notes or Registered Certificates, the Principal Agent or Registrar, as applicable, shall cancel and destroy the Bearer Notes or Registered Certificates held by it which are signed by such person and upon written request shall provide to the Issuer a confirmation of destruction in respect thereof specifying the Bearer Notes or Registered Certificates so cancelled and destroyed.
(4) If the Principal Agent pays an amount (the "Advance") to the Issuer on the basis that a payment (the "Payment") has been, or will be, received from a Dealer and if the Payment is not received by the Principal Agent on the date the Principal Agent pays the Issuer, the Principal Agent shall notify the Issuer by tested facsimile or email that the Payment has not been received and the Issuer shall repay to the Principal Agent the Advance and shall pay interest on the Advance (or the unreimbursed portion thereof) from (and including) the date such Advance is made to (but excluding) the earlier of repayment of the Advance and receipt by the Principal Agent of the Payment (at a rate quoted at that time by the Principal Agent as its cost of funding the Advance).
(5) Except in the case of issues where the Principal Agent does not act as receiving bank for the Issuer in respect of the purchase price of the Notes being issued, if on the relevant Issue Date, a Dealer does not pay the full purchase price due from it in respect of any Note (the "Defaulted Note") and, as a result, the Defaulted Note remains in the Principal Agent's distribution account with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg after such Issue Date, the Principal Agent will continue to hold the Defaulted Note pursuant to the order of the Issuer.
 
The Principal Agent shall notify the Issuer forthwith of the failure of the Dealer to pay the full purchase price due from it in respect of any Defaulted Note and, subsequently, shall notify the Issuer forthwith upon receipt from the Dealer of the full purchase price in respect of such Defaulted Note and to pay to the Issuer the amount so received.
 
(1) Subject to sub-clause 12 below, the Principal Agent shall advise the Issuer, as soon as shall be practicable preceding the date on which any payment is to be made to the Principal Agent pursuant to this sub-clause (1) of the payment amount, value date and payment instructions and the Issuer will before 10:00 a.m. (London time) on each date on which any payment in respect of any Notes issued by it becomes due, transfer to an account specified by the Principal Agent such amount in the relevant currency as shall be sufficient for the purposes of such payment in funds settled through such payment system as the Principal Agent and the Issuer may agree.
(2) The Issuer will ensure that no later than 4:00 p.m. (London time) on the second Business Day (as defined below) immediately preceding the date on which any payment is to be made to the Principal Agent pursuant to sub-clause (1), the Principal Agent shall receive from the paying bank of the Issuer an irrevocable confirmation in the form of an authenticated SWIFT message that such payment shall be made. For the purposes of this Clause 9, "Business Day" means a day which is both:
(a) a day (other than a Saturday or Sunday) on which commercial banks and foreign exchange markets settle payments and are open for general business (including dealing in foreign exchange and foreign currency deposits) in London and New York and any additional business center(s) specified in the applicable Final Terms ("Additional Business Center(s)"); and
(b) either (1) for any sum payable in a Specified Currency other than euro, a day on which commercial banks and foreign exchange markets settle payments and are open for general business (including dealing in foreign exchange and foreign currency deposits) in the principal financial centers (as defined below) of the country of the relevant Specified Currency (if other than London) or (2) for any sum payable in euro, a day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer System ("TARGET2 System") or any successor thereto is operating.
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Final Terms, the principal financial center of any country for the purpose of this Clause 9 shall be the relevant financial centers (if any) specified for the relevant Specified Currency in Section 1.5 or Section 1.6 of the ISDA Definitions, except that the principal financial center for Australian Dollars shall be Melbourne and Sydney, the principal financial center for Canadian Dollars shall be Toronto, and the principal financial center for New Zealand Dollars shall be Wellington.
(3) The Principal Agent shall ensure that payments of principal, interest and any other amount in respect of any Bearer Temporary Global Note will be made only to the extent that certification of non-U.S. beneficial ownership as required by U.S. Treasury regulations has been received from Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg in accordance with the terms thereof. Any such certification shall contain all certifications and information set forth in the form set out in Schedule 7, and be retained by the Principal Agent, and a copy shall be furnished to the Issuer, in accordance with Clause 6(1)(c) above.
(4) Subject to the receipt by the Principal Agent of payment as provided in sub-clause (1) above, the Principal Agent or the relevant Paying Agent shall pay or cause to be paid all amounts due in respect of the Notes on behalf of the Issuer in the manner provided in the Terms and Conditions. If any payment provided for in sub-clause (l) is made late but otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Principal Agent and each Paying Agent shall nevertheless make payments in respect of the Notes as aforesaid following receipt by it of such payment.
(5) If for any reason the Principal Agent considers in its sole discretion that the amounts to be received by the Principal Agent pursuant to sub-clause (1) will be, or the amounts actually received by it pursuant thereto are, insufficient to satisfy all claims in respect of all payments then falling due in respect of the
 
Notes, neither the Principal Agent nor any Paying Agent shall be obliged to pay any such claims until the Principal Agent has received the full amount of all such payments. Should the Principal Agent or any Paying Agent elect not to make payment of amounts falling due in respect of the Notes as aforesaid, it shall advise the Issuer of any such decision as soon as practicable by telephone with confirmation by facsimile or e-mail.
(6) Without prejudice to sub-clauses (4) and (5), if the Principal Agent pays any amounts to the holders of Notes, Receipts or Coupons or to any Paying Agent at a time when it has not received payment in full in respect of the relevant Notes in accordance with sub-clause (1) (the excess of the amounts so paid over the amounts so received being the "Shortfall"), the Issuer will, in addition to paying amounts due under sub-clause (l), pay to the Principal Agent on demand interest (at a rate which represents the Principal Agent's cost of funding the Shortfall) on the Shortfall (or the unreimbursed portion thereof) until the receipt in full by the Principal Agent of the Shortfall.
(7) The Principal Agent shall on demand promptly reimburse each Paying Agent for payments in respect of Notes properly made by such Paying Agent in accordance with this Agreement and the Terms and Conditions unless the Principal Agent has notified the Paying Agent, prior to the opening of business in the location of the office of the Paying Agent through which payment in respect of the Notes can be made prior to the day on which such Principal Agent has to give payment instructions in respect of the due date of a payment in respect of the Notes, that the Principal Agent does not expect to receive sufficient funds to make payment of all amounts falling due in respect of such Notes.
(8) If the Principal Agent pays out on or after the due date therefor, or becomes liable to pay out, funds on the assumption that a corresponding payment by the Issuer has been or will be made and such payment has in fact not been made by the Issuer, then the Issuer shall on demand reimburse the Principal Agent for the relevant amount, and pay interest to the Principal Agent on such amount from the date on which it is paid out to the date of reimbursement at a rate per annum equal to the cost to the Principal Agent of funding the amount paid out, as certified by the Principal Agent and expressed as a rate per annum. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of the Terms and Conditions as to subordination shall not apply to the Issuer's obligations under this sub-clause (8).
(9) While any Notes are represented by a Bearer Global Note or a Registered Global Certificate, all payments or deliveries due in respect of such Notes shall be made to, or to the order of, the holder of the Bearer Global Note or with respect to the Registered Global Certificate, the person or persons for the time being shown in the Register maintained by the Registrar as the Noteholder or Noteholders, subject to, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Bearer Global Note or Registered Global Certificates. In the case of a CGN, the Paying Agent to which any Bearer Global Note was presented for the purpose of making such payment shall cause the appropriate Schedule to the relevant Global Note to be annotated so as to evidence the amounts and dates of such payments of principal, interest or other amounts, as applicable. In the case of any Bearer Global Note which is a NGN, the Principal Agent shall instruct Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg to make appropriate entries in their records to reflect such payment.
(10) All payments in respect of any Bearer Note shall be made outside the United States and its possessions and shall not be made by transfer to an account at a bank, or delivered to an address, located inside the United States or its possessions by any office or agency of the Issuer, the Principal Agent, or any Paying Agent. Terms used in this sub-clause shall have the meanings given to them by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and regulations thereunder.
(11) If the amount of principal, interest or other amounts then due for payment is not paid in full (otherwise than by reason of a deduction required by law to be made therefrom), (i) the Paying Agent to which a Bearer Note is presented for the purpose of making such payment shall, unless the Bearer Note is a NGN, make a record of such shortfall on the Bearer Note and such record shall, in the absence of manifest error, be prima facie evidence that the payment in question has not to that extent been made or (ii) in the case of any Bearer Global Note which is a NGN, the Principal Agent shall instruct Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg to make appropriate entries in their records to reflect such shortfall in payment.
 
(12) If any payments or deliveries due on any Physical Delivery Notes, as defined in the Terms and Conditions, including pursuant to sub-clause 10 above, are required to be paid by delivery of any asset other than cash, then neither the Principal Agent nor any Paying Agent shall be responsible hereunder for the delivery of such non-cash consideration. Instead, the delivery of such non-cash consideration shall be effected or procured by the Delivery Agent in the manner provided by the Delivery Agency Agreement upon receipt of an Asset Transfer Notice from the relevant Noteholder in the manner contemplated by the Terms and Conditions. No Physical Delivery Amount shall be delivered in the United States or its possessions, transferred to an account at a bank or delivered to an address located inside the United States or its possessions, or to, or for the account or benefit of a U.S. person (as defined in Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended). For purposes of taking any action required to be taken by the Principal Agent hereunder, including, but not limited to, any notations required to be made on the Notes, the Principal Agent may rely upon any notification delivered to it by the Delivery Agent pursuant to the Delivery Agency Agreement as to the amounts delivered by the Delivery Agent thereunder (or any shortfall, as the case may be) on any Interest Payment Date, Maturity Date, or any other relevant payment date.
 
(1) The Principal Agent shall make all such determinations and calculations (howsoever described) as it is required to do under the Terms and Conditions, all subject to and in accordance with the Terms and Conditions, provided that certain calculations with respect to the Notes, and associated publication or notification, shall be made by the relevant Calculation Agent in accordance with the relevant Calculation Agency Agreement.
(2) For the purposes of monitoring the aggregate principal amount of Notes issued under the Program, the Principal Agent shall determine the U.S. Dollar equivalent of the principal amount of each issue of Notes denominated in another currency, each issue of Partly Paid Notes, Index Linked Notes, Share Linked Notes, Inflation Linked Notes, Commodity Linked Notes, FX Linked Notes, Hybrid Notes, Notes Linked to other Underlying Assets and Dual Currency Notes as follows:
(a) the U.S. Dollar equivalent of Notes denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars shall be determined as of the Agreement Date for such Notes on the basis of the spot rate for the sale of the U.S. Dollar against the purchase of the relevant currency quoted by a foreign exchange dealer selected by the Issuer on the relevant day of calculation;
(b) the U.S. Dollar equivalent of Index Linked Notes, Share Linked Notes, Inflation Linked Notes, Commodity Linked Notes, FX Linked Notes, Hybrid Notes, Dual Currency Notes, and Notes Linked to other Underlying Assets shall be calculated as specified above by reference to the original nominal amount of such Notes;
(c) the U.S. Dollar equivalent of Partly Paid Notes shall be determined as specified above by reference to the original principal amount of such Notes regardless of the amount paid on the Notes; and
(d) the U.S. Dollar equivalent of Zero Coupon Notes and other Notes that are issued at a discount or premium (other than a de minimis discount in the ordinary course), shall be calculated as specified above by reference to the net proceeds received by the Issuer for the relevant issue.
 
(1) Prior to the first payment on any Note, the Principal Agent shall have submitted to the Issuer, or shall have on file with the Issuer, a properly executed Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Form W-9, and any Paying Agent with respect to such Note shall have submitted to the Issuer, or shall have on file with the Issuer, such IRS form as the Issuer shall determine to be necessary or advisable.
 
(2) In respect of all Notes the payments on which are specified in the applicable Final Terms as being subject to United States withholding taxes, the Principal Agent and any Paying Agent with respect to such Note shall, unless otherwise notified by the Issuer, withhold United States federal income tax in accordance with U.S. law on all payments as specified in the applicable Final Terms, forward the amount withheld to the IRS, and comply with any U.S. tax reporting requirements.
(3) If the Issuer, in respect of any payment not described in Clause 11(2) above, is required to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges, the Issuer shall give written notice thereof to the Principal Agent and any Paying Agent with respect to such Note as soon as it becomes aware of the requirement to make such withholding or deduction and shall give to the Principal Agent and such Paying Agent such information as the Principal Agent or such Paying Agent shall require to enable it to comply with such requirement, and the Principal Agent and Paying Agent shall comply with such requirement.
(4) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in respect of all Registered Notes, the Principal Agent and any Paying Agent with respect to the Notes shall collect IRS Forms W-8BEN, W-8IMY, W-9 (or any successor forms thereto) or other appropriate tax forms from the Noteholders and withhold taxes to the extent required by law.
(5) The Principal Agent and any Paying Agent with respect to a Note shall report payments to the Noteholders and the IRS as appropriate under U.S. law.
(6) The Principal Agent and any Paying Agent with respect to a Note shall provide the Issuer with any information required by the Issuer in connection with the Principal Agent's compliance with the tax requirements of this Clause 11.
 
(1) If so permitted by the applicable Final Terms, and subject to the provisions of the Terms and Conditions, if the Issuer decides to redeem any outstanding Notes (in whole or in part) for the time being outstanding prior to their Maturity Date or the Interest Payment Date falling in the redemption month (as the case may be) in accordance with the Terms and Conditions, the Issuer shall give 7 calendar days written notice of such decision to the Principal Agent on or prior to the date on which the Issuer will give notice of such redemption to the Noteholders in accordance with the Terms and Conditions in order to enable the Principal Agent to undertake its obligations herein and in the Terms and Conditions.
(2) If only some of the Notes of like tenor and of the same Series are to be redeemed on such date, the Principal Agent shall make the required drawing in accordance with the Terms and Conditions but shall give the Issuer reasonable notice of the time and place proposed for such drawing. Where partial redemptions are to be effected when there are Definitive Notes outstanding, the Principal Agent will select by lot the Notes to be redeemed from the outstanding Notes in compliance with all applicable laws and stock exchange requirements and deemed by the Principal Agent to be appropriate and fair. Where partial redemptions are to be effected when there are no Definitive Notes outstanding, the rights of Noteholders will be governed by the standard provisions of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg (to be reflected in the records of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg as either a pool factor or a reduction in nominal amount, at their discretion). Notice of any partial redemption and, when there are Definitive Notes outstanding, of the serial numbers of the Bearer Definitive Notes or Registered Definitive Certificates so drawn, will be given by the Principal Agent to the Noteholders in accordance with the terms of the Notes and this Agreement.
(3) On behalf of and at the expense of the Issuer, the Principal Agent shall publish the notice required in connection with any such redemption and shall at the same time also publish a separate list of the serial numbers of any Bearer Definitive Notes or Registered Definitive Certificates previously drawn and not presented for redemption. Such notice shall specify the date fixed for redemption, the redemption amount, the record date, the manner in which redemption will be effected and, in the case of a partial redemption, the serial numbers of the Notes to be redeemed and the nominal amounts of the Notes to be redeemed. Such notice will be published in accordance with the Terms and Conditions. The Principal Agent also will notify the other Paying Agents of any
 
date fixed for redemption of any Notes. In addition, the Principal Agent shall send to each holder of Registered Notes that are called in whole or in part for redemption or exercise of any option, at its address shown in the Register, a copy of such notice together with details of such Noteholder's Registered Notes called for redemption or subject to any option and the extent of such redemption or the terms of the exercise of such option.
(4) Immediately prior to the date on which any notice of redemption is to be given to the Noteholders, the Issuer shall deliver to the Principal Agent a certificate stating that the Issuer is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth in reasonable detail a statement of facts showing that all conditions precedent to such redemption have occurred or been satisfied and shall comply with all notice requirements provided for in the Terms and Conditions.
(5) Each Paying Agent, with respect to Bearer Notes, and each Transfer Agent, with respect to Registered Notes, will keep a stock of Put Notices for Bearer Definitive Notes or Registered Definitive Notes in the form set out in Schedule 10 hereto, and will make such notices available on demand to Noteholders of such Notes for which the Terms and Conditions provide for redemption at the option of Noteholders. Each Paying Agent, with respect to Bearer Notes, or Transfer Agent, with respect to Registered Notes, shall promptly transfer a copy of any valid Put Notice that it receives to the Issuer and the Principal Agent. Upon receipt of any Bearer Definitive Note or Registered Definitive Certificate deposited in the exercise of such option in accordance with the Terms and Conditions, the Paying Agent, with respect to Bearer Notes, or Transfer Agent, with respect to Registered Notes, with which such Bearer Note or Registered Certificate is deposited shall hold such Bearer Note (together with any Coupons, if any, relating to it and deposited with it) or Registered Certificate on behalf of the depositing Noteholder (but shall not, save as provided below, release it) until the due date for redemption of the relevant Note consequent upon the exercise of such option, when, subject as provided below and Clause 9(12) above, it shall present such Bearer Note (and any such Coupons, if any) to itself and the Issuer for payment of the amount due thereon together with any interest and any other amounts due on such date in accordance with the Terms and Conditions and shall pay such amounts in accordance with Condition 6, and if applicable, the directions of such Noteholder contained in the Put Notice. In the event of exercise of any other option, each Paying Agent, with respect to Bearer Notes or Transfer Agent, with respect to Registered Notes, shall take steps required of it in the Terms and Conditions and, in the case of Registered Notes, Clause 17. If, prior to such due date for its redemption, such Note becomes immediately due and payable or if upon due presentation payment of such redemption monies is improperly withheld or refused, the applicable Paying Agent or Transfer Agent shall post such Bearer Note (together with any such Coupons, if any) or such Registered Certificate by uninsured post to, and at the risk of, the relevant Noteholder unless the Noteholder has otherwise requested and paid the costs of such insurance to the relevant Paying Agent at the time of depositing the Bearer Notes or Registered Certificates at such address outside the United States and its possessions as may have been given by the Noteholder in the Put Notice or, in the case of Registered Notes where no address has been given, to the address appearing in the Register. At the end of each period for the exercise of such option, each Paying Agent and each Transfer Agent shall promptly notify the Principal Agent of the principal amount of the Notes in respect of which such option has been exercised with it, together with their serial numbers (or those of the Registered Certificates representing them), and the Principal Agent shall promptly notify such details to the Issuer.
(6) Each Paying Agent and Transfer Agent will keep a stock of Asset Transfer Notices for (in the case of the Paying Agents) Bearer Definitive Notes and (in the case of the Transfer Agent) Registered Definitive Notes which are Physical Delivery Notes in the form set out in Schedule 13, and will make such notices available on demand to holders of such Notes. Each Paying Agent, with respect to Bearer Notes, and the Transfer Agent, with respect to Registered Notes, shall promptly transfer a copy of any valid Asset Transfer Notice that it receives to the Issuer and the Principal Agent. Upon receipt of any Note deposited in connection with the delivery of any Physical Delivery Amount as to a Physical Delivery Note, the Paying Agent or Transfer Agent with which such Bearer Note or Registered Certificate is deposited shall hold such Bearer Note (together with any Coupons, if any, relating to it and deposited with it) or Registered Certificate on behalf of the depositing Noteholder of such Bearer Note or Registered Certificate (but shall not, except as provided below, release it) until the due date for delivery of the applicable Physical Delivery Amount of the relevant Note, when, subject as provided below and Clause 9(12) above, it shall present such Bearer Note (and any such Coupons, if any) or Registered Certificate , together with the serial numbers of the applicable Bearer Notes or Registered Certificates, to itself, the Issuer and the Delivery Agent for delivery of the Physical Delivery Amount due thereon in accordance with the Terms and Conditions. If, prior to such due date for delivery, such Note becomes immediately due and payable or if upon due
 
presentation, delivery or payment of the Physical Delivery Amount or any monies is improperly withheld or refused, the Paying Agent shall post such Bearer Note (together with any such Coupons, if any) or Registered Certificate by uninsured post to, and at the risk of, the relevant Noteholder of such Note unless such Noteholder has otherwise requested and paid the costs of such insurance to the relevant Paying Agent at the time of depositing the Bearer Notes or Registered Certificate at such address outside the United States and its possessions as may have been given by such Noteholder in the Asset Transfer Notice.
(7) The Principal Agent shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event not later than 3:00 p.m. (local time) on the following Business Day on which a duly completed Asset Transfer Notice is delivered to it), notify the Issuer, the Calculation Agent (if applicable), and the Delivery Agent of details of the Notes in respect of which an Asset Transfer Notice has been delivered by any holder of Notes (such notification to be in such form and in such manner as the Issuer, the relevant Dealer, the Calculation Agent, and (if applicable) the Delivery Agent may reasonably request from time to time).
(8) The Principal Agent shall keep a full and complete record of all Notes and of their exercise, redemption and cancellation in accordance with this Clause 12 and make such records available at all reasonable times to the Issuer and any persons authorized by it for inspection and for the taking of copies thereof or extracts therefrom.
(9) The Principal Agent shall, as soon as practicable after the date on which all the Notes represented by any Bearer Global Note or by any Registered Global Certificate have been exercised or redeemed or have expired or have become null and void and upon delivery by or on behalf of the common depositary (in the case of a Global Note issued in CGN form or a Registered Global Certificate) or the common safekeeper (in the case of a Bearer Global Note issued in NGN form) of the relevant Bearer Global Note or Registered Global Certificate to the Principal Agent, cancel the relevant Bearer Global Note or Registered Global Certificate or cause it to be cancelled and thereafter, unless otherwise instructed by the Issuer, destroy the relevant Bearer Global Note or Registered Global Certificate and upon written request by the Issuer certify such destruction to the Issuer.
 
(1) Upon the receipt by the Principal Agent of a demand or notice from any Noteholder in accordance with the Terms and Conditions, the Principal Agent shall forward a copy thereof to the Issuer.
(2) On behalf of and at the request and expense of the Issuer, the Principal Agent shall cause to be published all notices required to be given by the Issuer to the Noteholders in accordance with the Terms and Conditions.
(3) The Principal Agent shall have no responsibility to obtain the certificate of the Issuer delivered by the Issuer to the Principal Agent pursuant to Condition 6 if such a certificate is required to be issued, nor shall the Principal Agent have any responsibility to notify the Issuer if such a certificate is required to be issued.
 
(1) All Bearer Notes which are redeemed, all Receipts or Coupons which are paid, all Talons which are exchanged, and all Registered Certificates representing Registered Notes that are redeemed, shall be delivered outside the United States and its possessions to the Principal Agent, and shall be cancelled by the Principal Agent or Transfer Agent through which they are redeemed, paid or exchanged. In addition, the Issuer shall notify the Principal Agent or Transfer Agent, as applicable, in writing of all Notes which are purchased by or on behalf of the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries and all such Notes (or Registered Certificates in respect of Registered Notes) surrendered to the Principal Agent for cancellation, together (in the case of Bearer Definitive Notes) with all unmatured Receipts, Coupons or Talons (if any) attached thereto or surrendered therewith, shall be cancelled by the Principal Agent.
(2) The Issuer shall have the right to request that the Principal Agent in the case of Bearer Notes, or the Registrar, in the case of Registered Notes, provide, without limitation, the following information:
 
(a) the aggregate principal amount of Notes which have been redeemed and the aggregate amount paid in respect thereof;
(b) the number of Notes cancelled together (in the case of Definitive Notes, if any) with details of all unmatured Receipts, Coupons or Talons (if any) attached thereto or delivered therewith;
(c) the aggregate amount paid in respect of interest on the Notes;
(d) the total number by maturity date of Receipts, Coupons and Talons so cancelled; and
(e) in the case of Bearer Definitive Notes, if any, the serial numbers of such Notes, or in the case of Registered Notes, the serial numbers of the Registered Certificates representing them, which shall be given to the Issuer by the Principal Agent or Registrar, as applicable, as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within three months after the date of such repayment or, as the case may be, payment or exchange.
(3) The Principal Agent shall destroy all cancelled Notes, Receipts, Coupons, Talons and Certificates.
(4) The Principal Agent shall keep a full and complete record of all cancelled Bearer Notes, Receipts, Coupons, Talons and Registered Certificates (other than serial numbers of Coupons, except those which have been replaced pursuant to Condition 11) and of all replacement Notes, Receipts, Coupons, Talons or Registered Certificates issued in substitution for mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes, Receipts, Coupons, Talons or Registered Certificates. The Principal Agent shall at all reasonable times make such record available to the Issuer and any persons authorized by it for inspection and for the taking of copies thereof or extracts therefrom.
(5) All records and certificates made or given pursuant to this Clause 14 and Clause 15 shall make a distinction between Bearer Notes, Receipts, Coupons, Talons and Registered Certificates of each Series.
(6) The Principal Agent is authorized by the Issuer and instructed to (a) in the case of any Bearer Global Note which is a CGN, to endorse or to arrange for the endorsement of the relevant Bearer Global Note to reflect the reduction in the nominal amount represented by it by the amount so redeemed or purchased and cancelled and (b) in the case of any Bearer Global Note which is a NGN, to instruct Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg to make appropriate entries in their records to reflect such redemption or purchase and cancellation, as the case may be.
 
(1) The Issuer will cause a sufficient quantity of additional forms of Notes, Receipts, Coupons, Talons and Registered Certificates to be available, upon request to the Principal Agent or Registrar, respectively (in such capacity, the "Replacement Agent"), at its specified office for the purpose of issuing replacement Notes, Receipts, Coupons, Talons and Registered Certificates as provided below.
(2) The Replacement Agent will, subject to, and in accordance with, the Terms and Conditions and the following provisions of this Clause 15, authenticate (or in the case of a Bearer Global Note that is a Eurosystem-eligible NGN, instruct the common safekeeper to effectuate the same) and cause to be delivered any replacement Bearer Notes, Receipts, Registered Certificates, Coupons and Talons which the Issuer may determine to issue in place of Bearer Notes, Receipts, Registered Certificates, Coupons and Talons which have been lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed.

Note will only have attached to it Receipts, Coupons and Talons corresponding to those (if any) attached to the mutilated or defaced Bearer Note which is presented for replacement.

If the applicable Final Terms indicate that this Global Note is intended to be a New Global Note, the nominal amount of Notes represented by this Global Note shall be the aggregate amount from time to time entered in the records of both Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. ("Euroclear") and Clearstream Banking, socit anonyme ("Clearstream, Luxembourg" and, together with Euroclear, the "Relevant Clearing Systems"). The records of the Relevant Clearing Systems (which expression in this Global Note means the records that each Relevant Clearing System holds for its customers which reflect the amount of such customer's interest in the Notes) shall be conclusive evidence of the nominal amount of Notes represented by this Global Note and, for these purposes, a statement issued by a Relevant Clearing System (which statement shall be made available to the bearer upon request) stating the nominal amount of Notes represented by this Global Note at any time shall be conclusive evidence of the records of the Relevant Clearing System at that time.
If the applicable Final Terms indicate that this Global Note is intended to be a Classic Global Note, the nominal amount of the Notes represented by this Global Note shall be the amount stated in the applicable Final
 
Terms or, if lower, the nominal amount most recently recorded by or on behalf of the Issuer, in the relevant column in Part II, III or IV of Schedule 1 or in Schedule 2.
On any redemption, payment of an Installment Amount, delivery or purchase and cancellation of any of the Notes represented by this Global Note, the Issuer shall procure that:
(a) if the applicable Final Terms indicate that this Global Note is intended to be a New Global Note, details of such redemption, payment, delivery or purchase and cancellation (as the case may be) shall be entered pro rata in the records of the Relevant Clearing Systems and, upon any such entry being made, the nominal amount of the Notes recorded in the records of the Relevant Clearing Systems and represented by this Global Note shall be reduced by the principal amount of the Notes so redeemed or purchased and cancelled or by the amount of such installment so paid; or
(b) if the applicable Final Terms indicate that this Global Note is intended to be a Classic Global Note, details of such redemption, payment, delivery or purchase and cancellation (as the case may be) shall be entered in the relevant column in Part II, III or IV of Schedule 1 or Schedule 2 hereto recording any such redemption, payment, delivery or purchase and cancellation (as the case may be) and shall be signed by or on behalf of the Issuer.

Prior to the Exchange Date (as defined below), all payments (if any) on this Global Note will only be made to the bearer hereof to the extent that there is presented to the Principal Agent by Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear, a certificate, substantially in the form set out in Schedule 7 to the Agency Agreement, to the effect that it has received from or in respect of a person entitled to a particular principal amount of the Notes (as shown by its records) a certificate in or substantially in the form of the certificate as set out in Schedule 8 to the Agency Agreement. Payments or deliveries due in respect of Notes for the time being represented by this Global Note shall be made to the bearer of this Global Note and each payment so made will discharge the Issuer's obligations in respect thereof. Any failure to make the entries referred to in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall not affect such discharge. After the Exchange Date, the bearer of this Global Note will not be entitled to receive any payment of interest hereon.
On or after the Exchange Date (as defined below) this Global Note may be exchanged in whole or in part (free of charge) for, as specified in the Final Terms, either (a) if the applicable Final Terms indicate that this Global Note is intended to be a New Global Note, interests recorded in the records of the Relevant Clearing Systems in a Bearer Permanent Global Note or, if the applicable Final Terms indicate that this Global Note is intended to be a Classic Global Note, a Bearer Permanent Global Note, which, in either case, is in or substantially in the form set out in Schedule 2 to the Agency Agreement (together with the Final Terms attached to it), in each case upon notice being given by a Relevant Clearing System acting on the instructions of any holder of an interest in this Global Note or, (b) under certain limited circumstances, security printed Definitive Notes and, (if applicable) Coupons, Receipts and/or Talons in the form set out in Parts I, II, III, and IV respectively of Schedule 3 to the Agency Agreement (on the basis that all the appropriate details have been included on the face of such Definitive Notes and (if applicable) Coupons, Receipts and/or Talons and the Final Terms have been incorporated on such Definitive Notes) and subject to such notice period as is specified in the Final Terms. The "Exchange Date" for this Global Note will normally be the 40th calendar day after the later of the date on which the Issuer receives the proceeds of the sale of the Global Note and the closing date for the Global Note. However, if the Issuer, a Dealer or any distributor, as defined in Treasury Regulation Sec. 1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(D)(4), holds a Note represented by this Global Note as part of an unsold allotment or subscription for more than 40 calendar days after the later of the date on which the Issuer receives the proceeds of the sale of the Global Note and the closing date for the Global Note, the Exchange Date with respect to such Note will be the day after the date on which the Issuer, Dealer or distributor sells such Note.
This Global Note may be exchanged by the bearer hereof on any day (other than a Saturday or Sunday) on which banks are open for business in London. The Issuer shall procure that Definitive Notes and interests in the Bearer Permanent Global Note shall be so issued and delivered and (in the case of the Bearer Permanent Global
 
Note where the applicable Final Terms indicate that this Global Note is intended to be a New Global Note) recorded in the records of the Relevant Clearing System in exchange for only that portion of this Global Note in respect of which there shall have been presented to the Principal Agent by Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg a certificate, substantially in the form set out in Schedule 7 to the Agency Agreement, to the effect that it has received from or in respect of a person entitled to a beneficial interest in a particular principal amount of the Notes (as shown by its records) a certificate from such person in or substantially in the form of the certificate set out in Schedule 8 to the Agency Agreement, unless such certificate has already been given in accordance with the above provisions. The aggregate principal amount of interests in a Bearer Permanent Global Note issued upon an exchange of this Global Note subject to the terms hereof, will be equal to the aggregate principal amount of this Global Note submitted by the bearer hereof for exchange (to the extent that such principal amount does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of this Global Note).
On an exchange of the whole of this Global Note, this Global Note shall be surrendered to the Principal Agent. On an exchange of only part of this Global Note, the Issuer shall procure that:
(a) if the applicable Final Terms indicate that this Global Note is intended to be a New Global Note, details of such exchange shall be entered pro rata in the records of the Relevant Clearing Systems; or
(b) if the applicable Final Terms indicate that this Global Note is intended to be a Classic Global Note, details of such exchange shall be entered in the relevant space in Schedule 2 hereto recording such exchange and shall be signed by or on behalf of the Issuer and the principal amount of this Global Note and the Notes represented by this Global Note shall be reduced by the principal amount so exchanged.
If, following the issue of a Bearer Permanent Global Note in exchange for some of the Notes represented by this Global Note, further Notes represented by this Global Note are to be exchanged for interests in a Bearer Permanent Global Note, such exchange may be effected, subject as provided herein, without the issue of a new Bearer Permanent Global Note, (i) if the applicable Final Terms indicate that this Global Note is intended to be a New Global Note, recording the details of such increase in the records of the Relevant Clearing Systems, or (ii) if the applicable Final Terms indicate that this Global Note is not intended to be a New Global Note, by the Issuer or its agent endorsing Schedule 2 of the Bearer Permanent Global Note previously issued to reflect an increase in the aggregate principal amount of such Bearer Permanent Global Note by an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Bearer Permanent Global Note which would otherwise have been issued on such exchange.
Until the exchange of the whole of this Global Note as aforesaid, the bearer hereof shall in all respects (except as otherwise provided herein) be entitled to the same benefits as if such bearer were the bearer of Definitive Notes and (if applicable) Coupons, Receipts and/or Talons in the form set out in Parts I, II, III and Part IV, respectively, of Schedule 3 to the Agency Agreement.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Bearer Temporary Global Note, the Issuer irrevocably agrees, for the benefit of such Noteholders and their successors and assigns, that each Noteholder or its successors or assigns may file without the consent and to the exclusion of the bearer hereof, any claim, take any action or institute any proceeding to enforce, directly against the Issuer, the obligation of the Issuer hereunder to pay any amount due or to become due in respect of each Note represented by this Bearer Temporary Global Note which is credited to such Noteholder's securities account with Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg without the production of this Bearer Temporary Global Note; that the bearer hereof shall not theretofore have filed a claim, taken action or instituted proceedings to enforce the same in respect of such Note.
provided
Until exchanged in full for the Bearer Permanent Global Note, this Bearer Temporary Global Note in all respects shall be entitled to the same benefits under, and subject to the same terms and conditions of, the Agency Agreement as the Bearer Permanent Global Note authenticated and delivered thereunder, except that neither the Holder hereof nor the beneficial owners of this Bearer Temporary Global Note shall be entitled to receive payment hereon on or after the Exchange Date.
This Bearer Temporary Global Note shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, United States of America, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.
 
This Bearer Temporary Global Note shall not become valid or obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been duly signed by or on behalf of the Principal Agent acting in accordance with the Agency Agreement. If the applicable Final Terms indicate that this Global Note is intended to be held in a manner which would allow Eurosystem eligibility, this Global Note shall not become valid or obligatory for any purpose until it is duly effectuated by the entity appointed as common safekeeper by the Relevant Clearing Systems.

So long as any of the Notes are represented by a Bearer Global Note or a Registered Global Certificate held on behalf of the Relevant Clearing System, each person who is shown in the records of the Relevant Clearing System as the holder of a particular nominal amount of such Notes (any certificate or other document issued by the Relevant Clearing System as to the nominal amount of Notes standing on the account of any person shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, except in the case of manifest error) shall be treated by the Issuer, the Principal Agent, the Registrar, any Transfer Agent, and any other Paying Agent as the holder of such nominal amount of such Notes for all purposes, except with respect to the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest, or any other amounts payable on, or deliveries in respect of, the Notes, the bearer of the relevant Bearer Global Note or, in the case of a Registered Global Note, the person or persons for the time being shown in the Register as at the Record Date maintained by the Registrar as the Noteholder or Noteholders, shall be treated by the Issuer, the Principal Agent, and any Paying Agent as the holder of such Notes in accordance with and subject to the terms of the relevant Global Note (the expressions "" and "" and related expressions shall be construed accordingly). Interests in Notes which are represented by a Bearer Global Note or a Registered Global Certificate will be transferable only in accordance with the rules and procedures for the time being

The Issuer will issue Notes in the Specified Denomination(s) set forth in the applicable Final Terms. However, the minimum denomination permitted for each Note will be such denomination as may be allowed or required by the relevant central bank (or equivalent body) or any laws or regulations applicable to the Specified Currency.

In the case of a transfer of part only of a holding of Registered Notes represented by one Registered Certificate, a new Registered Certificate shall be issued to the transferee (following the transferee's surrender of any existing Registered Certificate in respect of Notes of that Series) in respect of the part transferred and a further new Registered Certificate in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred shall be issued to the transferor.
 
In the case of an exercise of an Issuer's or Noteholder's option in respect of, or a partial redemption of, a holding of Registered Notes represented by a single Registered Certificate, a new Registered Certificate shall be issued to the Noteholder to reflect the exercise of such option or in respect of the balance of the holding not redeemed. In the case of a partial exercise of an option resulting in Registered Notes of the same holding having different terms, separate Registered Certificates shall be issued in respect of those Notes of that holding that have the same terms. New Registered Certificates shall only be issued against surrender of the existing certificates to the Registrar or any Transfer Agent. In the case of a transfer of Registered Notes to a person who is already a holder of Registered Notes, a new Registered Certificate representing the enlarged holding shall only be issued against surrender of the Registered Certificate representing the existing holding.
 
Each Registered Certificate to be issued pursuant to Condition 2(b) or (c) shall be available for delivery within three business days after receipt of the request for exchange, form of transfer or Put Notice (as defined herein) or surrender of the Registered Certificate for exchange, as applicable. Delivery of the new Registered Certificate shall be made at the specified office of the Transfer Agent or of the Registrar (as the case may be) to whom delivery or surrender of such request for exchange, form of transfer, Put Notice or Registered Certificate shall have been made or, at the option of the Noteholder making such delivery or surrender as aforesaid and as specified in the relevant request for exchange, form of transfer, Put Notice or otherwise in writing, be mailed by uninsured mail at the risk of the Noteholder entitled to the new Registered Certificate to such address as may be so specified, unless such Noteholder requests otherwise and pays in advance to the Transfer Agent or Registrar the costs of such other method of delivery and/or such insurance as it may specify.

Senior Indebtedness shall continue to be Senior Indebtedness and shall be entitled to the benefits of such subordination irrespective of any amendment, modification, or waiver of any term of the Senior Indebtedness. There is no right of acceleration in the case of a default in the payment of interest on the Subordinated Notes or in the performance of any other obligation of the Issuer under the Subordinated Notes.
The Issuer shall not make any payment on account of principal of, premium, if any, interest, or any other amounts payable on, or deliveries in respect of, its Subordinated Notes or purchase any of its Subordinated Notes, either directly or indirectly, if (1) any default or Event of Default with respect to any of its Senior Indebtedness shall have occurred and be continuing and (2) it shall have received written notice thereof from the holders of at least 10.00 per cent. in principal amount of any kind or category of any of its Senior Indebtedness (or the representative or representatives of such holders).
Until all of the Issuer's Senior Indebtedness is paid in full, the holders of the Subordinated Notes will be subrogated (equally and ratably with the holders of all of the Issuer's indebtedness which, by its express terms, ranks equally with its Subordinated Notes, and is entitled to like rights of subrogation) to the rights of the holders of the Issuer's Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of its assets.
If the Issuer repays any of its Subordinated Notes before the required date or in connection with a distribution of its assets to creditors pursuant to a dissolution, winding up, liquidation, or reorganization, any principal, premium, if any, interest, or any other amounts payable or deliveries due will be paid or delivered to the holders of the Issuer's Senior Indebtedness before any holders of its Subordinated Notes are paid. In addition, if such amounts were previously paid to the holders of the Subordinated Notes, the holders of its Senior Indebtedness shall have first rights to such amounts previously paid.
No modification or amendment of the subordination provisions of Subordinated Notes and any related coupons in a manner adverse to the holders of Senior Indebtedness may be made without the consent of the holders of all of the Issuer's outstanding Senior Indebtedness.

In the case of Fixed-Rate Notes, Bearer Notes should be presented for payment together with all related unmatured Coupons (which expression shall for this purpose include Coupons to be issued upon exchange of matured Talons). Failure to present the above will result in the amount of any missing unmatured Coupon (or, in the case of payment not being made in full, the same proportion of the amount of such missing unmatured Coupon as the sum so paid bears to the sum due) being deducted from the sum due for payment. Each amount of principal so deducted will be paid as described above against surrender of the relative missing Coupon at any time before the expiration of five years after the Relevant Date (as defined in Condition 9) in respect of such principal (whether or not such Coupon would otherwise have become void under Condition 9) or, if later, five years from the date on which such Coupon would otherwise have become due. Upon any Bearer Note becoming due and payable prior to its Maturity Date, all relevant unmatured Talons, if any, will become void and no further Coupons will be issued in respect of that Bearer Note.

Upon the date on which any Bearer Note becomes due and repayable, unmatured Receipts, if any, relating thereto (whether or not attached), shall become void and no payment shall be made in respect thereof. Payment of the final installment will be made as provided in Condition 5(a) above against surrender of the relevant Bearer Notes.
If the due date for redemption of any Bearer Note is not a Fixed Interest Payment Date or an Interest Payment Date, interest, if any, accrued in respect of such Bearer Note, from (and including) the preceding Fixed Interest Payment Date or Interest Payment Date or, as the case may be, the Interest Commencement Date, shall be payable only against surrender of the relevant Bearer Note.
Except as provided in Condition 5(c), payments of principal, premium, if any, interest, or any other amounts payable on, or deliveries in respect of, a Bearer Global Note, will be made as specified above for Bearer Notes and otherwise as specified in the relevant Bearer Global Note outside the United States and its possessions against presentation or surrender, as the case may be, of such Bearer Global Note, and payments on any Bearer Note will be made at the specified office of any Paying Agent outside the United States and its possessions. The Paying Agent will record on each Bearer Global Note in CGN form each payment made against presentation or surrender of such Bearer Global Note, distinguishing between any payment of principal, premium, if any, interest, or any other amounts payable, and such record shall be prima facie evidence that the payment has been made.

Subject thereto, in the case of Notes held by a Relevant Clearing System, the Relevant Clearing System will confirm to the Principal Agent the ISIN and number of Notes the subject of such notice, and the details for the delivery of the Physical Delivery Amount of each Note. Upon receipt of such confirmation, the Principal Agent will inform the Issuer and the Delivery Agent thereof. In the case of Notes held by a Relevant Clearing System, the Relevant Clearing System will on the Delivery Date debit the securities account of the relevant Noteholder with the relevant Notes.
 
Any determination as to whether an Asset Transfer Notice is duly completed and in proper form shall be made by the Relevant Clearing System in consultation with the Principal Agent (in the case of Notes held by a Relevant Clearing System) or the Principal Agent (in the case of Notes that are not held by a Relevant Clearing System) after consulting with the Issuer and the Delivery Agent, and shall be conclusive and binding on the Issuer, the Principal Agent, the Delivery Agent, and the relevant Noteholder. Subject as set out below, any Asset Transfer Notice so determined to be incomplete or not in proper form, or which is not copied or sent as provided in Condition 5(h)(A)(1) above, shall be null and void. If such Asset Transfer Notice is subsequently corrected to the satisfaction of the Relevant Clearing System or the Principal Agent, as applicable, it shall be deemed to be a new Asset Transfer Notice submitted at the time such correction was delivered to the Relevant Clearing System or the Principal Agent, as applicable.
The Relevant Clearing System (or the Principal Agent in the case of Notes held outside a Relevant Clearing System) shall use its best efforts promptly to notify
 
the Noteholder submitting an Asset Transfer Notice if, in consultation with the Principal Agent (in the case of Notes held by a Relevant Clearing System) after consulting with the Issuer and the Delivery Agent, it has determined that such Asset Transfer Notice is incomplete or not in proper form. In the absence of negligence or willful misconduct on its part, none of the Issuer, the Agents, or the Relevant Clearing System shall be liable to any person with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken in connection with such determination or the notification of such determination to a Noteholder.
No Asset Transfer Notice may be withdrawn after receipt thereof by either the Relevant Clearing System or the applicable Paying Agent, as provided above. After delivery of an Asset Transfer Notice, the relevant Noteholder may not transfer the Notes which are the subject of such notice.

Delivery Date
If a Noteholder fails to give an Asset Transfer Notice as provided herein on or prior to the Physical Delivery Cut-Off Date, then the Physical Delivery Amount will be delivered as soon as practicable after the Interest Payment Date, Maturity Date, or other relevant date as specified in the applicable Final Terms, as the case may be, (in which case, such date of delivery shall be the Delivery Date) at the risk of such Noteholder in the manner provided below. For the avoidance of doubt, in such circumstances such Noteholder shall not be entitled to any payment, whether of interest or otherwise, as a result of such Delivery Date falling after the Interest Payment Date, Maturity Date, or such other relevant date as specified in the applicable Final Terms and no liability in respect thereof shall attach to the Issuer, the Calculation Agent, or the Delivery Agent.
The Issuer shall, at the risk of the relevant Noteholder, deliver or procure the delivery of the Physical Delivery Amount for each Note, pursuant to the details specified in the Asset Transfer Notice or in such commercially reasonable manner as the Issuer shall in its sole discretion determine and notify to the person designated by the Noteholder in the relevant Asset Transfer Notice, provided that in the case of Notes held by a Relevant Clearing System, all deliveries are expected to be made through such Relevant Clearing System.
All Expenses arising from the delivery of the Physical Delivery Amount in respect of such Notes shall be for the account of the relevant Noteholder, and no delivery of the Physical Delivery Amount shall be made until all Expenses have been paid to the satisfaction of the Issuer by the relevant Noteholder.
 
 
Notes held by the same Noteholder will be aggregated for the purpose of determining the aggregate Physical Delivery Amounts in respect of such Notes, provided that the aggregate Physical Delivery Amounts in respect of the same Noteholder will be rounded down to the nearest whole unit of the Relevant Asset or each of the Relevant Assets, as the case may be, in such manner as the Calculation Agent shall determine.
Therefore, fractions of the Relevant Asset or of each of the Relevant Assets, as the case may be, will not be delivered and no cash adjustment will be made in respect thereof.
Following the Delivery Date of a share certificate in respect of any Share, all dividends on the relevant Shares to be delivered will be payable to the party that would receive such dividend according to market practice for a sale of the Shares executed on the Delivery Date and to be delivered in the same manner as such relevant Shares. Any such dividends (net of any Expenses) to be paid to a Noteholder will be paid to the account specified by the Noteholder in the relevant Asset Transfer Notice as referred to in Condition 5(h)(A)(1).

Asset(s).
In the case of Definitive Notes held outside of a Relevant Clearing System where Physical Settlement is applicable, the relevant Reference Assets (if any) shall be delivered to the Noteholder by the Delivery Agent on behalf of the Issuer.
 
If, in the opinion of the Calculation Agent, delivery of the Physical Delivery Amount using the method of delivery specified in the applicable Final Terms or such commercially reasonable manner as the Calculation Agent has determined is not practicable by reason of a Settlement Disruption Event having occurred and continuing on the Delivery Date, then the Delivery Date shall be postponed to the first following Settlement Business Day in respect of which there is no
 
such Settlement Disruption Event, provided that, the Issuer may elect in its sole discretion to satisfy its obligations in respect of the relevant Note by delivering or procuring the delivery of the Physical Delivery Amount using such other commercially reasonable manner as it may select and in such event the Delivery Date shall be such day as the Issuer deems appropriate in connection with delivery of the Physical Delivery Amount in such other commercially reasonable manner. For the avoidance of doubt, where a Settlement Disruption Event affects some but not all of the Relevant Assets comprising the Physical Delivery Amount, the Delivery Date for the Relevant Assets not affected by the Settlement Disruption Event will be the originally designated Delivery Date. For so long as delivery of the Physical Delivery Amount is not practicable by reason of a Settlement Disruption Event, then in lieu of physical settlement and notwithstanding any other provision hereof the Issuer may elect in its sole and absolute discretion to satisfy its obligations in respect of the relevant Note by payment to the relevant Noteholder of the Disruption Cash Redemption Amount on the fifth Business Day following the date that notice of such election is given to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 14. Payment of the Disruption Cash Redemption Amount will be made in such manner as shall be notified to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 14. The Calculation Agent shall give notice as soon as practicable to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 14 that a Settlement Disruption Event has occurred. No Noteholder shall be entitled to any payment in respect of the relevant Note in the event of any delay in the delivery of the Physical Delivery Amount due to the occurrence of a Settlement Disruption Event and no liability in respect thereof shall attach to the Issuer, the Calculation Agent, or the Delivery Agent.

A holder of a Registered Note may, by an instrument in writing in the form available from the specified office of a Transfer Agent in the English language executed by or on behalf of the holder and delivered to the Transfer Agent at least 24 hours before the time fixed for a meeting, appoint a Proxy to act on such holders' behalf in connection with that meeting. A Proxy need not be a Noteholder. A corporation which holds a Registered Note may by delivering to a Transfer Agent at least 24 hours before the time fixed for a meeting a certified copy of a resolution of its directions or other governing body (with, if it is not in English, a certified translation into English) authorize any person to act as its representative in connection with that meeting.
3. The Principal Agent may at any time and, upon a requisition in writing of Noteholders holding not less than 33% in principal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding, shall convene a meeting of the Noteholders and if the Principal Agent makes default for a period of seven days in convening such a meeting the same may be convened by the Issuer or the requisitionists. Whenever the Principal Agent is about to convene any such meeting it shall forthwith give notice in writing to the Issuer and the Dealers of the day, time and place thereof and of the nature of the business to be transacted thereat. Every such meeting shall be held at such time and place in the City of New York or London as the Principal Agent may approve.
4. Notice of every meeting of Noteholders shall be published on behalf and at the expense of the Issuer in accordance with Condition 14. Such notice shall set forth the time and the place of such meeting and in general terms the action proposed to be taken at such meeting, and shall be published at least twice, the first publication to be not less than 21 nor more than 180 calendar days prior to the date fixed for the meeting. Such notice shall include a statement to the effect that Notes may be deposited with Paying Agents for the purpose of obtaining voting certificates or appointing proxies not less than 24 hours before the time fixed for the meeting or that, in the case of corporations, they may appoint representatives by resolution of their directors or other governing body. A copy of the notice shall be sent by post to the Issuer (unless the meeting is convened by the Issuer).
5. In case at any time the Issuer or the holders of at least 33% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding shall have requested the Principal Agent to call a meeting of Noteholders, by written request setting forth in reasonable detail the action proposed to be taken at the meeting, and the Principal Agent shall not have given the first notice of such meeting within 21 calendar days after receipt of such request or shall not thereafter proceed to cause the meeting to be held as provided herein, then the Issuer or Noteholders of Notes in the amount above specified may determine the time and the place in either of the locations designated in paragraph 3 hereof for such meeting and may call such meeting by giving notice thereof as provided in paragraph 4 hereof.
6. Any person (who may but need not be a Noteholder) nominated in writing by the Issuer shall be entitled to the chair at every such meeting but if no such nomination is made or if at any meeting the person nominated shall not be present within 15 minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting the Noteholders present shall choose one of their number to be Chairman. To be entitled to vote at any meeting of Noteholders, a
 
person shall be (i) a Noteholder of one or more Notes, or (ii) a Proxy. The only persons who shall be entitled to be present or to speak at any meeting of Noteholders shall be the persons entitled to vote at such meeting and their counsel and any representatives of the Principal Agent and its counsel and any representatives of the Issuer and its counsel.
7. At any such meeting, one or more persons present holding Notes or voting certificates or being proxies and holding or representing in the aggregate not less than a majority in principal amount of the Notes shall (except for the purpose of passing an Extraordinary Resolution) form a quorum for the transaction of business and no business (other than the choosing of a Chairman) shall be transacted at any meeting unless the requisite quorum be present at the commencement of business. The quorum at any such meeting for passing an Extraordinary Resolution shall (subject as provided below) be one or more persons present holding Notes or voting certificates or being proxies and holding or representing in the aggregate 67% in principal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding, , at any meeting the business of which includes any of the following matters (each of which shall only be capable of being effected after having been approved by an Extraordinary Resolution) namely:
provided
that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the quorum shall be one or more persons present holding Notes or voting certificates or being Proxies and holding or representing in the aggregate not less than two-thirds in principal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding. An Extraordinary Resolution passed at any meeting of the holders of Notes will be binding on all holders of Notes whether or not they are present at the meeting, and on all holders of Coupons appertaining to such Notes.
8. In the absence of a quorum within 30 minutes of the time appointed for any such meeting, the meeting shall, if convened at the request of the Noteholders (as provided in Section 5 hereof), be dissolved. In any other case, the meeting shall be adjourned for a period of not less than 10 calendar days as determined by the chairman of the meeting prior to the adjournment of such adjourned meeting. Notice of the reconvening of any adjourned meeting shall be given as provided in paragraph 4 hereof except that such notice need be published only once but must be given not less than five calendar days prior to the date on which the meeting is scheduled to be reconvened. Subject to the foregoing, at the reconvening of any meeting adjourned for a lack of a quorum the persons entitled to vote 33% in principal amount of the Notes shall constitute a quorum for the taking of any action set forth in the notice of the original meeting. Notice of the reconvening of an adjourned meeting shall state expressly the percentage of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that shall constitute a quorum. At a meeting or an adjourned meeting duly reconvened and at which a quorum is present as aforesaid, any resolution and all matters (except as limited by Condition 15) shall be effectively passed and decided if passed or decided by the persons entitled to vote a majority in principal amount of the Notes represented and voting at such meeting, provided that such amount shall be not less than 33% in principal amount of the Notes outstanding. Any Noteholder who has executed and delivered an instrument in writing appointing a person as his Proxy shall be deemed to be present for
 
the purposes of determining a quorum and be deemed to have voted; , , that such Noteholder shall be considered as present or voting only with respect to the matters covered by such instrument in writing. Any resolution effectively passed or decision taken at any meeting of the Noteholders duly held in accordance with this paragraph 8 shall be binding on all Noteholders whether or not present or represented at the meeting and whether or not notation of such decision is made upon the Notes.
provided
however
9. Notice of any adjourned meeting at which an Extraordinary Resolution is to be submitted shall be given in the same manner as notice of an original meeting but as if 10 were substituted for 21 in paragraph 4 above and such notice shall (except in cases where the proviso to paragraph 6 above shall apply when it shall state the relevant quorum) state that one or more persons present holding Notes or voting certificates or being proxies at the adjournment meeting whatever the principal amount of the Notes held or represented by them will form a quorum. Subject as aforesaid it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjourned meeting.
10. Every question submitted to a meeting shall be decided in the first instance by a show of hands and in case of equality of votes the Chairman shall both on a show of hands and on a poll have a casting vote in addition to the vote or votes (if any) to which he may be entitled as a Noteholder or as a holder of a voting certificate or as a Proxy.
11. At any meeting, unless a poll is (before or on the declaration of the results of the show of hands) demanded by the Chairman or the Issuer or by one or more persons present holding Notes or voting certificates or being Proxies and holding or representing in the aggregate not less than two percent in principal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding, a declaration by the Chairman that a resolution has been carried or carried by a particular majority or lost or not carried by a particular majority shall be conclusive evidence of the fact without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favor of or against such resolution.
12. Subject to paragraph 14 below, if at any such meeting a poll is so demanded it shall be taken in such manner and subject as hereinafter provided either at once or after an adjournment as the Chairman directs and the result of such poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded as at the date of the asking of the poll. The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of the meeting for the transaction of any business other than the motion on which the poll has been demanded.
13. The Chairman may with the consent of (and shall if directed by) any such meeting adjourn the same from time to time and from place to place but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting except business which might lawfully (but for lack of required quorum) have been transacted at the meeting from which the adjournment took place.
14. Any poll demanded at any such meeting on the election of a Chairman or on any question of adjournment shall be taken at the meeting without adjournment.
15. Any director or officer of the Issuer and its lawyers and other professional advisers may attend and speak at any meeting. Save as aforesaid, but without prejudice to the proviso to the definition of "outstanding" in sub-clause 1(b) of this Agreement, no person shall be entitled to attend and speak nor shall any person be entitled to vote at any meeting of the Noteholders or join with others in requisitioning the convening of such a meeting unless he either produces the Note or Notes of which he is the holder or a voting certificate or is a Proxy. Neither the Issuer nor any of its subsidiaries shall be entitled to vote at any meeting in respect of Notes held by it for the benefit of any such company and no other person shall be entitled to vote at any meeting in respect of Notes held by it for the benefit of any such company. Nothing herein contained shall prevent any of the Proxies named in any block voting instruction from being a director, officer or representative of or otherwise connected with the Issuer.
16. Subject as provided in paragraph 15 hereof at any meeting:
(A) on a show of hands every person who is present in person and produces a Note or voting certificate or is a Proxy shall have one vote; and
(B) on a poll every person who is so present shall have one vote in respect of:
 
(i) in the case of a meeting of the holders of Notes all of which are denominated in a single currency, each minimum integral amount of such currency; and
(ii) in the case of a meeting of the holders of Notes denominated in more than one currency, each U.S. $1.00 or, in the case of a Note denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars, the equivalent of U.S. $l.00 in such currency at the Principal Agent's spot buying rate for the relevant currency against U.S. Dollars at or about 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the date of publication of the notice of the relevant meeting (or of the original meeting of which such meeting is an adjournment), or such other amount as the Principal Agent shall in its absolute discretion stipulate in principal amount of Notes so produced or represented by the voting certificate so produced or in respect of which he is a Proxy.
Without prejudice to the obligation of the proxies named in any block voting instructions, any person entitled to more than one vote need not use all his votes or cast all the votes to which he is entitled in the same way.
17. The proxies named in any block voting instruction need not be Noteholders.
18. Each block voting instruction together (if so requested by the Issuer) with proof satisfactory to the Issuer of its due execution on behalf of the relevant Paying Agent shall be deposited at such place as the Principal Agent shall approve not less than 24 hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the proxies named in the block voting instruction propose to vote and in default the block voting instruction shall not be treated as valid unless the Chairman of the meeting decides otherwise before such meeting or adjourned meeting proceeds to business. A certified copy of each block voting instruction shall be deposited with the Principal Agent before the commencement of the meeting or adjourned meeting, but the Principal Agent shall not thereby be obliged to investigate or be concerned with the validity of or the authority of the proxies named in any such block voting instruction.
19. Any vote given in accordance with the terms of a block voting instruction shall be valid notwithstanding the previous revocation or amendment of the block voting instruction or of any of the Noteholders' instructions pursuant to which it was executed, no intimation in writing of such revocation or amendment shall have been received from the relevant Paying Agent by the Issuer at its registered office (or such other place as may have been approved by the Principal Agent of the purpose) by the time being 24 hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the block voting instruction is to be used.

If the Notes/Certificate referred to above are to be returned to the undersigned under Clause 12(6) of the Amended and Restated Agency Agreement dated July 25, 2008 among Bank of America Corporation, as issuer, The Bank of New York Mellon, as principal agent, The Bank of New York (Luxembourg) S.A., as transfer agent and registrar, and the other agents named therein (the "Agency Agreement"), they should be returned by post to (See Note (1) below):
 
 
 
 
 
Notes
(1) The Agency Agreement provides that Notes or authorities so returned will be sent by post, uninsured and at the risk of the Noteholder, unless the Noteholder otherwise requests and pays the costs of such insurance in advance to the relevant Paying Agent.
(2) This Asset Transfer Notice is not valid unless all of the paragraphs requiring completion are duly completed.
(3) The Paying Agent or Transfer Agent with whom the above-mentioned Bearer Notes or Registered Certificates are deposited will not in any circumstances be liable to the depositing Noteholder or any other person for any loss or damage arising from any act, default or omission of such Paying Agent or Transfer Agent in relation to the said Bearer Notes or Registered Certificates or any of them unless such loss or damage was caused by the fraud or gross negligence of such Paying Agent or Transfer Agent or its directors, officers or employees.
 
These provisions are applicable separately to each Series of Notes.
1. Each Registered Certificate shall represent an integral number of Registered Notes.
2. Unless otherwise requested by the holder and agreed by the relevant Issuer and save as provided in the Terms and Conditions, each holder of more than one Registered Note shall be entitled to receive only one Registered Certificate in respect of its holding.
3. Unless otherwise requested by the joint holders and agreed by the relevant Issuer and save as provided in the Terms and Conditions, the joint holders of one or more Registered Notes shall be entitled to receive only one Registered Certificate in respect of their joint holding which shall, except where they otherwise direct, be delivered to the joint holder whose name appears first in the register of the holders of Registered Notes in respect of the joint holding. All references to "Noteholder", "Transferor" and "Transferee" shall include joint holders, transferors and transferees.
4. The executors or administrators of a deceased holder of Registered Notes (not being one of several joint holders) and, in the case of the death of one or more of joint holders, the survivor or survivors of such joint holders shall be the only persons recognised by the relevant Issuer as having any title to such Registered Notes.
5. Any person becoming entitled to Registered Notes in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the holder of such Registered Notes may, upon producing such evidence that such person holds the position in respect of which that person proposes to act under this paragraph or of his title as the Transfer Agent or the Registrar shall require (including legal opinions), be registered as the holder of such Registered Notes or, subject to the preceding paragraphs as to transfer, may transfer such Registered Notes. The Issuer, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar may retain any amount payable upon the Registered Notes to which any person is so entitled until such person shall be so registered or shall duly transfer the Registered Notes.
6. The Registered Note(s) are transferable by execution of the form of transfer at Schedule 15 of this Agency Agreement (as defined below) under the hand of the Transferor or, where the Transferor is a corporation or other entity, either under its common seal or under the hand of two of its officers duly authorized in writing. In each case, the form of transfer must be duly completed and executed and duly stamped (where applicable) and must be accompanied by the Registered Certificate in respect of such Registered Note and such documents, evidence and information as may be required pursuant to the Terms and Conditions and such other evidence as the Issuer, the Registrar or the Transfer Agent may reasonably require to prove the title of the Transferor or the Transferor's right to transfer the Registered Note(s) and, if the form of transfer is executed by some other person on the Transferor's behalf or in the case of the execution of a form of transfer on behalf of a corporation by its officers, the authority of that person or those persons to do so. In the case of a transfer of part only of a holding of Registered Notes represented by one Registered Certificate to a person who is already a holder of Registered Notes, the Registrar shall only issue a new Registered Certificate representing the enlarged holding against surrender of the existing Registered Certificate, and a further new Registered Certificate in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred shall be issued to the Transferor.
7. All transfers of, and exercises of options relating to and deliveries of Registered Certificates representing, Registered Notes shall be made in accordance with the Terms and Conditions.
8. Without prejudice to any applicable restrictions on transfer, upon acceptance for transfer of an interest in Notes evidenced by a Registered Global Certificate for individual Registered Definitive Certificates as provided herein, the Registrar shall record the entries in the Register in respect of the Registered Notes accordingly.
 
All capitalized terms used in this Schedule 14 shall have the meanings given to them in the Agency Agreement.
