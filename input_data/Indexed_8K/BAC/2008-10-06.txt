CHARLOTTE  Bank of America Corporation today reported third quarter 2008 net income of $1.18 billion, or $0.15 per share, down from $3.70 billion, or $0.82 per share, a year earlier.
The company also announced two initiatives to raise capital, targeting an 8 percent Tier 1 Capital ratio. The company intends to sell common stock with a target of raising $10 billion. In addition, the Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend on common stock of $0.32 to be paid on December 26, 2008 to shareholders of record on December 5, 2008. Assuming the current number of issued and outstanding shares, the reduction from $0.64 paid in recent quarters would add more than $1.4 billion to capital each quarter.
"These are the most difficult times for financial institutions that I have experienced in my 39 years in banking," said Kenneth D. Lewis, chairman and chief executive officer. "We believe it is prudent to raise capital to very substantial levels in this uncertain environment. Both economic and financial market conditions have changed significantly in the last two months. We were willing to operate at capital levels over the short-term that were good, but not at our targeted levels, given projections two months ago. We now believe it is important to be at or near our 8 percent Tier 1 capital ratio target given the recessionary conditions and outlook for still weaker economic performance which we expect to drive higher credit losses and depress earnings. We believe that achieving higher capital levels today will position our company to provide credit to those consumers and businesses that are attracted to our strength and stability.
"We know many investors in our stock are quite disappointed with a dividend reduction," Lewis continued. "It is not a decision we made lightly. However, we cannot pay out what we have not earned. Our goal is to resume dividend increases from the new level as soon as our earnings performance warrants.
"All that said, our company continues to be profitable, and we have been able in the last year to make a number of moves that should significantly enhance our earnings when economic and financial market conditions improve. Our diversity and scale give us strength to deal with the current issues that few competitors can match. I have never been more optimistic about the long-term prospects of Bank of America."
Lower earnings in the third quarter compared to a year earlier were driven by a significant increase in provision expense, as credit costs continued to rise, partially offset by advances in various income categories largely as a result of the acquisition of Countrywide Financial Corporation on July 1, 2008 and LaSalle Bank. Countrywide results were not included in prior period results.
Bank of America is clearly benefiting from consumer and business flight to safety, as shown by year-over-year increases in loans and especially deposits. While consumer credit costs continued to increase in line with economic conditions, the company continued to increase the number of customer accounts and make progress in such categories as investment banking.
Third Quarter Selected Business Developments
 
 
 
 
Third Quarter 2008 Financial Summary
Revenue and Expense
Revenue net of interest expense on a fully taxable-equivalent basis rose 21 percent to $19.90 billion from $16.47 billion a year earlier.
Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis rose 33 percent to $11.92 billion from $8.99 billion in the third quarter of 2007 due to the acquisitions of LaSalle and Countrywide, loan and deposit growth, and the impact of rate movements. The net interest yield increased 32 basis points to 2.93 percent due to increased yields on market-based activity driven by the steepening of the yield curve and the mix of products.
Noninterest income increased 7 percent to $7.98 billion from $7.48 billion a year earlier. The company booked a $630 million charge for providing support to cash funds and losses of $313 million related to auction-rate securities. Noninterest income was adversely impacted by $1.8 billion in writedowns and charges associated with market disruptions, which included Global Corporate and Investment Banking's portion of the losses associated with auction-rate securities. Service charges income rose due in part to the increase in deposits. Mortgage banking income and insurance income also rose due to the acquisition of Countrywide.
Noninterest expense rose 34 percent to $11.66 billion, largely reflecting the addition of Countrywide and LaSalle. Pretax merger and restructuring charges related to acquisitions were $247 million compared with $84 million a year earlier. The efficiency ratio, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was 58.60 percent.
Credit Quality
Credit quality continued to weaken during the quarter with more rapid deterioration noted recently. The economy has moved to a recessionary environment and the risk of a prolonged recession has increased. Consumers are experiencing higher levels of stress from depreciating home prices, rising unemployment and tighter credit conditions. Higher levels of bankruptcies are occurring and delinquencies and losses have increased in all consumer portfolios.
Increased loss and delinquency trends first experienced in the home equity and homebuilder portfolios have now spread into the first mortgage, unsecured consumer lending and credit card portfolios. Deterioration has been more pronounced in California and Florida, which have been hit harder by home price depreciation and rising unemployment than in other markets. Commercial losses in sectors other than real estate and small business also increased, but remain below normalized ranges.
The company added almost $2 billion to the allowance for loan and lease losses during the quarter through provision. The additions were mainly for consumer loans,
including the unsecured consumer lending, credit card and residential mortgage portfolios. The current coverage ratios and amounts shown below include the addition of Countrywide.
 
 
 
 
 
Capital Management
Total shareholders' equity was $161.04 billion at September 30. Period-end assets were $1.83 trillion. The Tier 1 capital ratio estimate is 7.50 percent, down from 8.25 percent at June 30, 2008. The ratio was 8.22 percent a year earlier.
Bank of America paid a cash dividend of $0.64 per share in the quarter. The company also issued about 109 million common shares, including 107 million shares for the acquisition of Countrywide and 2 million shares related to employee stock options and ownership plans. No shares were repurchased during the quarter. Period-end common shares issued and outstanding were 4.56 billion for the third quarter, up from 4.45 billion for the second quarter of 2008 and 4.44 billion in the year ago quarter.
Transition update
The transition will reach a significant milestone in the fourth quarter with expected major systems conversions. In addition, the cost saves achieved in connection with the transaction will exceed original projections.
LaSalle
The transition at , which was acquired on July 1, is on track. The company today reached a major milestone by announcing in conjunction with a number of state attorneys general a proactive home retention program that will
Countrywide
modify troubled mortgages using principal reductions for nearly 400,000 Countrywide customers nationwide (see separate press release issued earlier today).
The combined company modified loans for more than 73,000 customers during the third quarter, up from 14,000 in the similar period in 2007.
Countrywide added $259 million in operating earnings to Bank of America this quarter, which was accretive to earnings per share by $0.06. The transition team is on track to reach targeted cost savings, which have been increased from original projections to $900 million after-tax, and expect to fully realize the benefits by 2011.
Bank of America agreed on September 15, 2008 to acquire . The company has begun to announce the senior management team of the combined company and the transition teams are beginning to map out their activities.

Reconciliation to GAAP financial measures
Supplemental financial data presented on an operating basis is a basis of presentation not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) that excludes merger and restructuring charges. We believe that the exclusion of merger and restructuring charges, which represent events outside our normal operations, provides a meaningful period-to-period comparison and is more reflective of normalized operations.
Return on average common shareholders' equity and return on average tangible shareholders' equity utilize non-GAAP allocation methodologies. Return on average common shareholders' equity measures the earnings contribution of a unit as a percentage of the shareholders' equity allocated to that unit. Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures the earnings contribution of the Corporation as a percentage of shareholders' equity reduced by goodwill. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity (i.e., capital) at the individual unit level and are integral components in the analytics for resource allocation. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue. We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation.
Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. See the tables below for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the three months ended September 30, 2008, June 30, 2008, March 31, 2008, December 31, 2007 and September 30, 2007, and the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007.

Investing in our common stock involves risks, including the risks described below, that are specific to our shares of common stock and risks that could affect us, our business and our industry. Before purchasing any shares of our common stock, you should consider carefully the risks and other information set forth in a prospectus supplement and the attached prospectus pursuant to which we offer common stock, as well as the risks described in the documents incorporated by reference in the prospectus supplement and the attached prospectus, including those set forth under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007.
There can be no assurance that recently enacted legislation authorizing the U.S. government to purchase large amounts of illiquid mortgages and mortgage-backed securities from financial institutions will help stabilize the U.S. financial system.
On October 3, 2008, President Bush signed into law the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the "EESA"). The legislation was the result of a proposal by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to the U.S. Congress on September 20, 2008 in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions. Pursuant to the EESA, the U.S. Treasury will have the authority to, among other things, purchase up to $700 billion of mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets. There can be no assurance, however, as to the actual impact that the EESA will have on the financial markets, including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced. The failure of the EESA to help stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, access to credit or the trading price of our common stock.
Difficult market conditions have adversely affected our industry.
Given the significance of our business in the United States, we are particularly exposed to downturns in the U.S. economy. Dramatic declines in the housing market over the past year, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures, unemployment and under-employment, have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, including government-sponsored entities as well as major commercial and investment banks. These write-downs, initially of mortgage-backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative and cash securities, in turn, have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital, to merge with larger and stronger institutions and, in some cases, to fail. Reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties, many lenders and institutional investors have reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers, including to other financial institutions. This market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence, increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity generally. The resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets has adversely affected our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not expect that the difficult conditions in the financial markets are likely to improve in the near future. A worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial institutions industry.In particular, we may face the following risks in connection with these events:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Current levels of market volatility are unprecedented.
The capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than 12 months. In recent weeks, the volatility and disruption has reached unprecedented levels. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers' underlying financial strength. If current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access capital and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.
Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
Any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets.
Although our long-term debt is currently rated investment grade by the major rating agencies, the ratings of that debt have been downgraded during 2008 by all of the major rating agencies. These rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings of our long-term debt are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. In light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets, there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings. Our failure to maintain those ratings could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital.
We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of a merger with Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.
On September 15, 2008, we announced that we had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 15, 2008, with Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. ("Merrill Lynch"). Pursuant to the merger agreement, our newly-formed wholly-owned merger subsidiary will, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, merge into Merrill Lynch (the "Merrill Lynch merger"), with Merrill Lynch continuing as the surviving entity and our wholly-owned subsidiary. Completion of the Merrill Lynch merger is subject to certain customary conditions, including, among others, approval of the stockholders of both Bank of America and Merrill Lynch and receipt of regulatory approvals.
 
If the Merrill Lynch merger is completed, its success will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the businesses of Bank of America and Merrill Lynch. However, to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings, we must successfully combine the businesses of Bank of America and Merrill Lynch. If we are not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.
Bank of America and Merrill Lynch have operated and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate, independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company's ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. Integration efforts between the two companies will also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of Merrill Lynch and Bank of America during such pre-merger transition period and for an undetermined period after consummation of the merger.
Many of the difficult market conditions that we face have adversely impacted Merrill Lynch as well.
Merrill Lynch and its business are subject to many of the same difficulties resulting from the market turmoil and tightening of credit as we are. Merrill Lynch has exposure to the mortgage market through securities, derivatives, loans and loan commitments, including CDOs and sub-prime mortgages or related securities, with respect to which Merrill Lynch has entered into credit derivatives with various counterparties, including financial guarantors. Like us, Merrill Lynch also faces counterparty risk. Valuation of these exposures will continue to be impacted by external market factors, including default rates, rating agency actions, and the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the continued availability of these transactions. Merrill Lynch's ability to mitigate its risk by selling or hedging its exposures is also limited by the market environment, and its future results may continue to be materially impacted by the valuation adjustments applied to these positions. Many of the risks discussed above relating to the financial institutions industry, the difficult market conditions that exist in our industry, the volatility of the capital and credit markets and our credit risks apply to Merrill Lynch as well. Certain of these risks may have a differing impact, which in certain cases may be, or may have been, more adverse with respect to Merrill Lynch than with respect to us. In addition, Merrill Lynch may face risks in addition to those that we face.
