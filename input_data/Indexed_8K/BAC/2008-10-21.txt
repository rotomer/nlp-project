The Corporation reports results, specifically , on a managed basis. This basis of presentation excludes the Corporation's securitized mortgage and home equity portfolios for which the Corporation retains servicing. Reporting on a managed basis is consistent with the way that management evaluates the results of . Managed basis assumes that securitized loans were not sold and presents earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold (i.e., held loans) are presented. Loan securitization is an alternative funding process that is used by the Corporation to diversify funding sources. Loan securitization removes loans from the Consolidated Balance Sheet through the sale of loans to an off-balance sheet qualified special purpose entity which is excluded from the Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).

Securitized loans continue to be serviced by the business and are subject to the same underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring as held loans. In addition, retained excess servicing income is exposed to similar credit risk and repricing of interest rates as held loans. managed income statement line items differ from a held basis reported as follows:
