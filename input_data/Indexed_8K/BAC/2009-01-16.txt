CHARLOTTE  Bank of America Corporation today reported full-year 2008 profit of $4.01 billion compared with net income of $14.98 billion a year earlier.
Earnings after preferred dividends and available to common shareholders were $2.56 billion, or $0.55 per diluted share, down from $14.80 billion, or $3.30 per share.
In the fourth quarter of 2008, the company had a net loss of $1.79 billion compared with net income of $268 million a year earlier. The net loss applicable to common shareholders was $2.39 billion, or $0.48 per diluted share, down from net income of $215 million, or $0.05 per share, in the same period in 2007. Results include Countrywide Financial, which Bank of America purchased on July 1, but not Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., which was acquired on January 1, 2009.
Fourth quarter results were driven by escalating credit costs, including additions to reserves, and significant writedowns and trading losses in the capital markets businesses. These actions reflect the deepening economic recession and extremely challenging financial environment, both of which significantly intensified in the last three months of 2008.

Global Consumer and Small Business Banking and Global Wealth and Investment Management were profitable, paced by Bank of America's successful and expanding deposit business. Negative results in Capital Markets and Advisory Services masked the profitability in Business Lending and Treasury Services within Global Corporate and Investment Banking.
Bank of America ended 2008 with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 9.15 percent.
Merrill Lynch preliminary results indicate a fourth-quarter net loss of $15.31 billion, or $9.62 per diluted share, driven by severe capital markets dislocations. (See the section of this news release and supplemental earnings information provided on investor.bankofamerica.com for further details.)
Transition Update
In view of the continuing severe conditions in the markets and economy, the U.S. government agreed to assist in the Merrill acquisition by making a further investment in Bank of America of $20 billion in preferred stock carrying an 8 percent dividend rate.
In addition, the government has agreed to provide protection against further losses on $118 billion in selected capital markets exposure, primarily from the former Merrill Lynch portfolio. Under the agreement, Bank of America would cover the first $10 billion in losses and the government would cover 90 percent of any subsequent losses. Bank of America would pay a premium of 3.4 percent of those assets for this program.
On a pro forma basis this would boost the company's Tier 1 capital ratio to approximately 10.70 percent.
In light of continuing severe economic and financial market conditions, the Bank of America Board of Directors has declared a first quarter dividend of $.01 per share payable March 27, 2009 to shareholders of record as of March 6, 2009.
Combined, these actions strengthen Bank of America and will allow the company to continue business levels that both support the U.S. economy and create future value for shareholders.
Bank of America extended more than $115 billion in new credit in the fourth quarter. It is increasing staff in its mortgage unit to meet a surge in demand that began late in December as mortgage rates fell. The company continues to prudently extend credit to commercial and consumer borrowers throughout its product line.

Fourth Quarter 2008 Financial Summary
Revenue and Expense
Revenue net of interest expense on a fully taxable-equivalent basis rose 19 percent to $15.98 billion from $13.45 billion a year earlier.
More
Page 4
Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis rose 37 percent to $13.41 billion from $9.82 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007 on higher market based income, the favorable rate environment, loan growth and the acquisition of Countrywide. The net interest yield improved 70 basis points to 3.31 percent.
Noninterest income declined 29 percent to $2.57 billion from $3.64 billion a year earlier. Mortgage banking income, gains on sales of debt securities, insurance premiums and service charges increased. The increases were more than offset by sales and trading losses in the Capital Markets and Advisory Services business.
Noninterest expense rose 5 percent to $10.95 billion from a year earlier mainly because of the addition of Countrywide which was partially offset by lower personnel costs. Pretax merger and restructuring charges related to acquisitions were $306 million compared with $140 million a year earlier. Given the capital markets disruptions, the company's efficiency ratio remains above normal levels.
Credit Quality
Credit quality deteriorated further during the quarter as the recession worsened. Consumers continued to experience high levels of stress from declining home prices, rising unemployment and tighter credit conditions. These factors led to higher losses and an increase in delinquencies in all consumer portfolios.
Declining home values, a slowdown in consumer spending and continued turmoil in the global financial markets negatively impacted the commercial portfolios. Commercial losses increased during the quarter driven by higher broad-based losses in the non-real estate domestic portfolios, the homebuilder portfolio, and several large defaults by foreign financial services borrowers.
Nonperforming assets were $18.23 billion or 1.96 percent of total loans, leases and foreclosed properties, compared with $13.58 billion, or 1.45 percent, at September 30 and $5.95 billion, or 0.68 percent, at December 31, 2007.
Total managed net losses were $7.40 billion, or 2.84 percent, of total average managed loans and leases compared with $6.11 billion, or 2.32 percent, in the third quarter and $3.28 billion, or 1.34 percent, in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Net charge-offs were $5.54 billion, or 2.36 percent of total average loans and leases compared with $4.36 billion, or 1.84 percent, in the third quarter and $1.99 billion, or 0.91 percent, in the fourth quarter of 2007.
More
Page 5
The provision for credit losses was $8.54 billion, up from $6.45 billion in the third quarter and $3.31 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007. The company added $2.99 billion to the allowance for loan and lease losses during the quarter. The additions were across most consumer portfolios reflecting economic stress on consumers. Reserves were also increased on commercial portfolios.
Capital Management
Total shareholders' equity was $177.05 billion at December 31. Period-end assets were $1.82 trillion. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 9.15 percent, up from 7.55 percent at September 30, 2008. The Tier 1 ratio was 6.87 percent a year earlier.
Bank of America issued 455 million common shares for $9.88 billion, $15 billion of preferred stock issued to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and did not repurchase any shares in the period. Period-end common shares issued and outstanding were 5.02 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008, 4.56 billion for the third quarter of 2008 and 4.44 billion in the year ago quarter. The company paid a cash dividend of $0.32 per common share and recorded $472 million in preferred dividends during the quarter. An additional $131 million of preferred dividends were deducted in the calculation of net income applicable to common shareholders.
In January 2009, an additional $10 billion of preferred stock (part of the original $25 billion assigned to Bank of America and Merrill Lynch) was issued to the U.S. Department of the Treasury as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The company also issued approximately 1.4 billion shares of common stock associated with the acquisition of Merrill Lynch.
Full-Year 2008 Financial Summary
Revenue and Expense
Revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis increased 8 percent to $73.98 billion from $68.58 billion a year earlier.
Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis increased to $46.55 billion from $36.19 billion in 2007 on higher market based income, consumer and commercial loan growth, the favorable rate environment and the addition of Countrywide and LaSalle. The net interest yield widened 38 basis points to 2.98 percent reflecting the more favorable interest rate environment and product mix.
Noninterest income fell 15 percent to $27.42 billion from $32.39 billion in 2007. Writedowns in the wake of market disruptions of $10.47 billion reduced results. Higher mortgage banking income, service charges and insurance premiums along with an increase in gains on sales of debt securities partially offset the decline.
More
Page 6
Noninterest expense increased 11 percent to $41.53 billion from $37.52 billion a year ago mainly due to the addition of Countrywide. The increase was partially offset by lower incentive compensation. Given the capital markets disruptions, the company's efficiency ratio remains above normal levels.
Credit Quality
Provision expense increased $18.44 billion to $26.83 billion in 2008 because of higher net charge-offs and additions to the reserve. The majority of the reserve additions were in the consumer and small business portfolios as the housing markets weakened and the economy slowed. Reserves on commercial portfolios were increased as the homebuilder and commercial domestic portfolios within Global Corporate and Investment Banking deteriorated
.
Total managed net losses were $22.90 billion during 2008, or 2.27 percent of total average managed loans and leases, compared with $11.25 billion or 1.29 percent during the prior year. Net charge-offs totaled $16.23 billion, or 1.79 percent of average loans and leases, compared with $6.48 billion, or 0.84 percent in 2007. Portfolios directly tied to housing, including home equity, residential mortgage and homebuilders drove a significant portion of the increase. The weaker economy also drove higher levels of net losses across the Card Services portfolios as well as the commercial portfolios.
Capital Management
For 2008, Bank of America recorded $10.26 billion in dividends to common shareholders and $1.32 billion to preferred shareholders. The company also issued approximately 580 million common shares, including 455 million during the fourth quarter and 107 million related to the Countrywide acquisition. In addition, Bank of America obtained nearly $35 billion in additional capital in connection with preferred stock issuances throughout the year.

Global Corporate and Investment Banking
 
Global Corporate and Investment Banking had a net loss of $14 million on significant writedowns, higher credit costs and lower net revenue. A 48 percent increase in net interest income and higher service charges and investment banking income were more than offset by market disruption charges of $10.47 billion, which were $6.45 billion a year earlier. Included in those charges were CDO-related writedowns of $4.78 billion, down from $5.65 billion during 2007, and leveraged-loan writedowns of $1.08 billion, compared with $196 million a year earlier.
The provision for credit losses increased $2.42 billion to $3.08 billion. Net charge-offs rose from low 2007 levels and with the exception of homebuilders were across a broad range of borrowers and industries. Reserves were increased due to deterioration in the homebuilder, commercial domestic and dealer-related portfolios.

Page 10
 
Global Corporate and Investment Banking reported a net loss of $2.44 billion for the quarter, compared with a net loss of $2.77 billion last year. The net loss narrowed on lower market disruption losses, higher net interest income due to lower short term rates, wider spreads and increased customer balances, and investment banking income, offset by higher credit costs.
Capital Markets and Advisory Services had negative net revenue of $4.64 billion in the period.
Market disruption-related impacts of $4.61 billion in the quarter include:

Global Wealth and Investment Management
 
Net income declined 28 percent to $1.42 billion as support for certain cash funds increased and credit costs rose.
Net revenue increased 3 percent from the 2007 addition of U.S. Trust and LaSalle and organic loan and deposit growth. The increase was offset by support to certain cash funds, writedowns related to auction rate securities and weaker equity markets.
The provision for credit losses increased $650 million to $664 million as a result of additions to the reserve and higher net charge-offs reflecting housing market deterioration and the slowing economy.

Page 12
 
Fourth quarter net income for Global Wealth and Investment Management increased 65 percent to $511 million compared with a year earlier due to higher net revenue and lower expenses. Net revenue increased 12 percent to $1.98 billion as higher net interest income driven by growth in loans and deposits was partially offset by weaker equity markets. Expenses declined 2 percent on lower incentive compensation.
All Other

All Other had a net loss of $1.63 billion for 2008 compared with net income of $3.15 billion a year earlier. For the fourth quarter the net loss of $693 million compared with net income of $830 million a year earlier. The declines are attributable to lower equity investment income, higher credit costs and increased merger and restructuring charges which more than offset gains on the sales of debt securities. Results were also adversely impacted by the absence of earnings due to the sale of certain businesses and foreign operations during 2007. Credit costs rose, primarily in the residential mortgage portfolio due to deterioration in the housing markets and the impacts of a slowing economy.

The Corporation reports results, specifically , on a managed basis. This basis of presentation excludes the Corporation's securitized mortgage and home equity portfolios for which the Corporation retains servicing. Reporting on a managed basis is consistent with the way that management evaluates the results of . Managed basis assumes that securitized loans were not sold and presents earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold (i.e., held loans) are presented. Loan securitization is an alternative funding process that is used by the Corporation to diversify funding sources. Loan securitization removes loans from the Consolidated Balance Sheet through the sale of loans to an off-balance sheet qualified special purpose entity which is excluded from the Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).
