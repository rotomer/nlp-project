Issuance of Preferred Stock and Warrants to the Treasury
On January 15, 2009, Bank of America Corporation (the "Registrant") entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with the United States Department of the Treasury (the "Treasury"), pursuant to which the Registrant sold (i) 800,000 shares of the Registrant's Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series R (the "Series R Preferred Stock") and (ii) a warrant (the "Warrant") to purchase 150,375,940 shares of the Registrant's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), for an aggregate purchase price of $20,000,000,000 in cash. The Purchase Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
The Series R Preferred Stock will qualify as Tier 1 capital and will pay cumulative dividends at a rate of 8% per annum. The Series R Preferred Stock may not be redeemed by the Registrant until the Registrant has redeemed its Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series N and Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series Q. The restrictions on redemption are set forth in the Certificate of Designations described in Item 5.03 below.
The Warrant has a 10-year term and is immediately exercisable upon its issuance, with an exercise price, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, equal to $13.30 per share of the Common Stock. The Warrant is attached as Exhibit 4.2 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
Under the Purchase Agreement, the Registrant agreed to certain compensation limitations applicable to its senior executive officers and certain other senior managers, and amended its benefit plans to the extent necessary to effect such limitations.
The Series R Preferred Stock and the Warrant were issued in a private placement exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Upon the request of the Treasury at any time, the Registrant has agreed to promptly enter into a deposit arrangement pursuant to which the Series R Preferred Stock may be deposited and depositary shares ("Depositary Shares"), representing fractional shares of Series R Preferred Stock, may be issued. The Registrant has agreed to register or designate a registration statement for the Series R Preferred Stock, the Warrant, the shares of Common Stock underlying the Warrant (the "Warrant Shares") and Depositary Shares, if any, as soon as practicable after the date of the issuance of the Series R Preferred Stock and the Warrant. Neither the Series R Preferred Stock nor the Warrant will be subject to any contractual restrictions on transfer.
Government Guarantee of Certain Assets of the Registrant
Also on January 15, 2009, the Registrant reached an agreement on a summary of terms with the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board (the "Federal Reserve") and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC," and together with the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, the "USG") under which the USG will provide loss sharing on approximately $118 billion of the Registrant's assets.
Under the terms of this arrangement, the Registrant will be responsible for the first $10 billion of eligible losses on the guaranteed assets. Any additional eligible losses will be borne 90% by the USG and 10% by the Registrant. As a result of the USG loss sharing, the covered asset portfolio will have a new risk weighting of 20%.
As a fee for this arrangement, the Registrant will issue preferred stock and warrants to Treasury and the FDIC. In addition, with respect to the non-recourse loan facility provided by the Federal Reserve, the Registrant will pay a fee of 20 basis points per year on the undrawn portion of the lending commitment and will pay interest at a rate equal to the overnight indexed swap rate plus 300 basis points on drawn amounts.
The summary of terms of the USG arrangement is attached as Exhibit 10.2 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The information set forth under "Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement" is incorporated herein by reference into this Item 3.02.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Registrant's ability to declare or pay dividends or distributions on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for consideration, shares of its Junior Stock (as defined below) and Parity Stock (as defined below) is subject to restrictions, including restrictions against paying a quarterly cash dividend per share of more than $0.01 on the Common Stock, without the prior approval of the Treasury. The redemption, purchase or other acquisition of trust preferred securities of the Registrant or its affiliates also will be restricted and shall require the prior approval of the Treasury. These restrictions will terminate on the earlier of (a) the third anniversary of the date of issuance of the Series R Preferred Stock and (b) the date on which the Series R Preferred Stock has been redeemed in whole or the Treasury has transferred all of the Series R Preferred Stock to third parties. The restrictions described in this paragraph are set forth in the Purchase Agreement.
In addition, pursuant to the Certificate of Designations, the ability of the Registrant to declare or pay dividends or distributions on, or repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for consideration, shares of its Junior Stock and Parity Stock will be subject to restrictions in the event that the Registrant fails to declare and pay full dividends (or declare and set aside a sum sufficient for payment thereof) on its Series R Preferred Stock. These restrictions are set forth in the Certificate of Designations described in Item 5.03.
"Junior Stock" means the Common Stock and any other class or series of stock of the Registrant the terms of which expressly provide that it ranks junior to the Series R Preferred Stock as to dividend rights and/or rights on liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Registrant. "Parity Stock" means any class or series of stock of the Registrant the terms of which do not expressly provide that such class or series will rank senior or junior to the Series R Preferred Stock as to dividend rights and/or rights on liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Registrant (in each case without regard to whether dividends accrue cumulatively or non-cumulatively).
 
The information set forth under "Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement" is incorporated herein by reference into this Item 5.02.
 
On January 16, 2009, the Registrant filed a Certificate of Designations (the "Certificate of Designations") with the Delaware Secretary of State for the purpose of amending its Certificate of Incorporation to fix the designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights of the Series R Preferred Stock.

Initial Number
(B) the Exercise Price payable upon exercise of the Warrant shall be adjusted by multiplying such Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the date of the agreement on pricing of such shares (or of such convertible securities) by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant prior to such date and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant immediately after the adjustment described in clause (A) above.
For purposes of the foregoing, the aggregate consideration receivable by the Company in connection with the issuance of such shares of Common Stock or convertible securities shall be deemed to be equal to the sum of the net offering price (including the Fair Market Value of any non-cash consideration and after deduction of any related expenses payable to third parties) of all such securities plus the minimum aggregate amount, if any, payable upon exercise or conversion of any such convertible securities into shares of Common Stock; and

In the case of adjustment for a cash dividend that is, or is coincident with, a regular quarterly cash dividend, the Per Share Fair Market Value would be reduced by the per share amount of the portion of the cash dividend that would constitute an Ordinary Cash Dividend.

which the denominator shall be the product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Pro Rata Repurchase minus the number of shares of Common Stock so repurchased and (ii) the Market Price per share of Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the first public announcement by the Company or any of its Affiliates of the intent to effect such Pro Rata Repurchase. In such event, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be increased to the number obtained by dividing (x) the product of (1) the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant before such adjustment, and (2) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the Pro Rata Repurchase giving rise to this adjustment by (y) the new Exercise Price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. For the avoidance of doubt, no increase to the Exercise Price or decrease in the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be made pursuant to this Section 13(D).
(E) . In case of any Business Combination or reclassification of Common Stock (other than a reclassification of Common Stock referred to in Section 13(A)), the Warrantholder's right to receive Shares upon exercise of this Warrant shall be converted into the right to exercise this Warrant to acquire the number of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) which the Common Stock issuable (at the time of such Business Combination or reclassification) upon exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to such Business Combination or reclassification would have been entitled to receive upon consummation of such Business Combination or reclassification; and in any such case, if necessary, the provisions set forth herein with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the Warrantholder shall be appropriately adjusted so as to be applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, to the Warrantholder's right to exercise this Warrant in exchange for any shares of stock or other securities or property pursuant to this paragraph. In determining the kind and amount of stock, securities or the property receivable upon exercise of this Warrant following the consummation of such Business Combination, if the holders of Common Stock have the right to elect the kind or amount of consideration receivable upon consummation of such Business Combination, then the consideration that the Warrantholder shall be entitled to receive upon exercise shall be deemed to be the types and amounts of consideration received by the majority of all holders of the shares of common stock that affirmatively make an election (or of all such holders if none make an election).
Business Combinations
(F) . All calculations under this Section 13 shall be made to the nearest one-tenth (1/10th) of a cent or to the nearest one- hundredth (1/100th) of a share, as the case may be. Any provision of this Section 13 to the contrary notwithstanding, no adjustment in the Exercise Price or the number of Shares into which this Warrant is exercisable shall be made if the amount of such adjustment would be less than $0.01 or one-tenth (1/10th) of a share of Common Stock, but any such amount shall be carried forward and an adjustment with respect thereto shall be made at the time of and together with any subsequent adjustment which, together with such amount and any other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate $0.01 or 1/10th of a share of Common Stock, or more.
Rounding of Calculations; Minimum Adjustments
(G) . In any case in which the provisions of this Section 13 shall require that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date for an event, the Company
Timing of Issuance of Additional Common Stock Upon Certain Adjustments
may defer until the occurrence of such event (i) issuing to the Warrantholder of this Warrant exercised after such record date and before the occurrence of such event the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise by reason of the adjustment required by such event over and above the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise before giving effect to such adjustment and (ii) paying to such Warrantholder any amount of cash in lieu of a fractional share of Common Stock; , , that the Company upon request shall deliver to such Warrantholder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such Warrantholder's right to receive such additional shares, and such cash, upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.
provided
however
(H) . For so long as the Original Warrantholder holds this Warrant or any portion thereof, if any event occurs as to which the provisions of this Section 13 are not strictly applicable or, if strictly applicable, would not, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, fairly and adequately protect the purchase rights of the Warrants in accordance with the essential intent and principles of such provisions, then the Board of Directors shall make such adjustments in the application of such provisions, in accordance with such essential intent and principles, as shall be reasonably necessary, in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors, to protect such purchase rights as aforesaid. The Exercise Price or the number of Shares into which this Warrant is exercisable shall not be adjusted in the event of a change in the par value of the Common Stock or a change in the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Company.
Other Events
(I) . Whenever the Exercise Price or the number ofShares into which this Warrant is exercisable shall be adjusted as provided in Section 13, the Company shall forthwith file at the principal office of the Company a statement showing in reasonable detail the facts requiring such adjustment and the Exercise Price that shall be in effect and the number of Shares into which this Warrant shall be exercisable after such adjustment, and the Company shall also cause a copy of such statement to be sent by mail, first class postage prepaid, to each Warrantholder at the address appearing in the Company's records.
Statement Regarding Adjustments
 
(J) . In the event that the Company shall propose to takeany action of the type described in this Section 13 (but only if the action of the type described in this Section 13 would result in an adjustment in the Exercise Price or the number of Shares into which this Warrant is exercisable or a change in the type of securities or property to be delivered upon exercise of this Warrant), the Company shall give notice to the Warrantholder, in the manner set forth in Section 13(I), which notice shall specify the record date, if any, with respect to any such action and the approximate date on which such action is to take place. Such notice shall also set forth the facts with respect thereto as shall be reasonably necessary to indicate the effect on the Exercise Price and the number, kind or class of shares or other securities or property which shall be deliverable upon exercise of this Warrant. In the case of any action which would require the fixing of a record date, such notice shall be given at least 10 days prior to the date so fixed, and in case of all other action, such notice shall be given at least 15 days prior to the taking of such proposed action. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of any such action.
Notice of Adjustment Event
 
(K) . As a condition precedent to the taking of any action which would require an adjustment pursuant to this Section
Proceedings Prior to Any Action Requiring Adjustment
13, the Company shall take any action which may be necessary, including obtaining regulatory, New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ Stock Market or other applicable national securities exchange or stockholder approvals or exemptions, in order that the Company may thereafter validly and legally issue as fully paid and nonassessable all shares of Common Stock that the Warrantholder is entitled to receive upon exercise of this Warrant pursuant to this Section 13.
(L) . Any adjustments pursuant to this Section 13 shall be made successively whenever an event referred to herein shall occur. If an adjustment in Exercise Price made hereunder would reduce the Exercise Price to an amount below par value of the Common Stock, then such adjustment in Exercise Price made hereunder shall reduce the Exercise Price to the par value of the Common Stock.
Adjustment Rules
14. . At any time following the date on which the shares of Common Stock of the Company are no longer listed or admitted to trading on a national securities exchange (other than in connection with any Business Combination), the Original Warrantholder may cause the Company to exchange all or a portion of this Warrant for an economic interest (to be determined by the Original Warrantholder after consultation with the Company) of the Company classified as permanent equity under U.S. GAAP having a value equal to the Fair Market Value of the portion of the Warrant so exchanged. The Original Warrantholder shall calculate any Fair Market Value required to be calculated pursuant to this Section 14, which shall not be subject to the Appraisal Procedure.
Exchange
15. . The Company will not, by amendment of its Charter or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Company, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Warrant and in taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights of the Warrantholder.
