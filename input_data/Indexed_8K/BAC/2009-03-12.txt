Exhibit 1.1
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
This Agreement is supplemental to the Distribution Agreement (the "Distribution Agreement") dated as of April 10, 2008, as supplemented, among the Company and the Selling Agents party thereto. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, the Initial Purchasers shall purchase the Notes, as principals, in accordance with the terms hereof. All capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Distribution Agreement.
The terms of the Notes shall be as set forth in the form or forms of Pricing Supplement attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A-1 (each, a "Pricing Supplement") and in the form or forms of Final Term Sheet attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A-2. For purposes of this Agreement and the Distribution Agreement, (a) the "Disclosure Package," as to each series of the Notes, shall also include, in addition to the documents referenced in the Distribution Agreement, the applicable Final Term Sheet and (b) the "Initial Sale Time" for the Notes shall be 4:10 p.m. on March 9, 2009.
The Notes are intended to constitute "FDIC-guaranteed debt," as such term is defined in 12 C.F.R  370.2(i). All references herein to the "TLG Program" are to the regulations of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") at 12 C.F.R. Part 370 and any amendments or additional rules and regulations of the FDIC promulgated in connection with the TLG Program under the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program.
This Agreement hereby appoints each Initial Purchaser that is not a party to the Distribution Agreement as a new Selling Agent (each a "New Selling Agent") in accordance with the provisions of Section 1(f) of the Distribution Agreement for the purposes of the issue of the Notes. Each New Selling Agent has delivered to the Company its address for notice hereunder, and under the Distribution Agreement and the Administrative Procedures, as set forth in Exhibit B hereto.
In consideration of the Company appointing the New Selling Agents as Selling Agents in respect of the Notes under the Distribution Agreement, each New Selling Agent hereby undertakes, for the benefit of the Company and each of the other Selling Agents, that, in relation to each series of the Notes, it will perform and comply with all the duties and obligations to be assumed by a Selling Agent under the Distribution Agreement, a copy of which it acknowledges it has received from the Company. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Distribution Agreement, each of the New Selling Agents shall be vested with all authority, rights, powers, duties and obligations of a Selling Agent in relation to the issue of the Notes as if originally named as a Selling Agent under the Distribution Agreement, provided that following the Settlement Date (as defined below) of the Notes, each of the New Selling Agents shall have no further such authority, rights, powers, duties or obligations, except such as may have accrued or been incurred prior to, or in connection with, the issuance of the Notes.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the purpose of this Agreement, "Commitment" means, in relation to an Initial Purchaser, the amount set forth opposite its name in Schedule 1, to the extent not reduced or terminated under this Agreement.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If any of the foregoing conditions is not satisfied on or before the Settlement Date, this Agreement shall terminate on such date and the parties hereto shall be under no further liability arising out of this Agreement (except for the liability of the Company in relation to expenses as provided in the Distribution Agreement and except for any liability arising before or in relation to such termination), provided that BAS, on behalf of the Initial Purchasers, may in its discretion waive any of the aforesaid conditions or any part of them.
 
The Company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If the sale of any of the Notes provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Selling Agents set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Selling Agents, the Company will reimburse the Selling Agents severally upon demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of such Notes.
 
If any one or more Selling Agents shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Notes agreed to be purchased by such Selling Agent or Selling Agents hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under the Distribution Agreement and/or this Agreement, the remaining Selling Agents shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which they have agreed to purchase such Notes, as the case may be, bear to the aggregate amount of Notes agreed to be purchased by all the remaining Selling Agents) the Notes which the defaulting Selling Agent or Selling Agents agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate amount of Notes which the defaulting Selling Agent or Selling Agents agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Notes that the Selling Agents have agreed to purchase, the remaining Selling Agents shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of such Notes, and if such non-defaulting Selling Agents do not purchase all such Notes, the agreement of the Selling Agents to purchase such Notes will terminate without liability to any non-defaulting Selling Agent or the Company. In the event of a default by any Selling Agent as set forth in this Section 8, the Settlement Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as BAS shall determine in order
 
that the required changes in either Disclosure Package or the Pricing Supplement or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in the Distribution Agreement or this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Selling Agent of its liability, if any, to the Company and any non-defaulting Selling Agent for damages occasioned by its default.
 
This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which, taken together, shall constitute one and the same agreement and any party may enter into this Agreement by executing a counterpart.
 
This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles of conflict of laws.
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding of our agreement, please sign and return to us the enclosed duplicate hereof, whereupon this letter and your acceptance shall represent a binding agreement among the Company and the several Initial Purchasers.
 
The foregoing Agreement is
hereby confirmed and accepted
as of the date specified above:
 
 
For itself and the other
several Initial Purchasers
 
 
 
 
 
 
FDIC Guarantee
This section provides summary information regarding the guarantee of the notes by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"). The details of the FDIC's guarantee are provided in the FDIC's regulations, 12 CFR Part 370, and at the FDIC's website, www.fdic.gov/tlgp. The regulations governing the guarantee and the terms and conditions of the guarantee are subject to change. These regulations, terms and conditions are subject to the interpretation of the FDIC, which also may change. The following information is based on the final regulations adopted effective November 21, 2008. In addition, as described in a Press Release dated February 10, 2009 (the "February 10, 2009 Press Release"), the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Chairman of the FDIC, the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision announced a Financial Stability Plan that includes, among other items, a proposal to extend the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (the "TLG program") through October 31,
 
2009, subject to additional premiums and promulgation of final rules relating to the Financial Stability Plan. The February 10, 2009 Press Release indicates that further information will be posted at www.financialstability.gov. The internet addresses provided above are included as inactive textual references only. The information on those websites shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in this term sheet.
On October 14, 2008, the FDIC created the TLG program, and the FDIC adopted final rules related to the TLG program effective November 21, 2008. Under the TLG program, the FDIC will guarantee the newly-issued senior unsecured debt of participating eligible entities, including insured depository institutions and eligible holding companies of insured depository institutions. We are an eligible entity under the TLG program, and a participant under the TLG program. As a participant, our senior unsecured debt may be guaranteed by the FDIC if it satisfies the TLG program's criteria. From time to time, we may issue debt securities that are not eligible for the FDIC guarantee and that will not be guaranteed. We will provide purchasers of our debt instruments with a written statement indicating if the debt instruments we are offering are FDIC-guaranteed under the TLG program.
TLG Program.
As a participant in the TLG program, we are eligible to issue FDIC-guaranteed debt up to an issuance limit, provided we comply with the terms and conditions of the TLG program, including payment of fees, delivery of notice to the FDIC of the issuance of guaranteed debt, providing certain disclosures, and certification to the FDIC that such issuance is within our issuance limit. As required by the TLG program, we have entered into a master agreement with the FDIC that governs certain aspects of the TLG program. If we are not in compliance with the TLG program, we would be unable to issue additional FDIC-guaranteed debt; however, the outstanding FDIC-guaranteed notes would not lose the benefit of the FDIC guarantee. Under the final rules as of the date of this term sheet, the TLG program guarantees eligible debt issued through June 30, 2009 that matures on or prior to June 30, 2012. According to the February 10, 2009 Press Release, the TLG program may be extended to guarantee eligible debt issued through October 31, 2009.
The notes are our senior unsecured debt obligations, are guaranteed by the FDIC under the TLG program, and are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. If we fail to pay interest or principal when due on the notes, the FDIC will pay holders of those notes the unpaid, then due amount of interest or principal. An event of default under the senior indenture, including a payment default, will not entitle the holders of the notes or the TLGP representative (as defined below) to accelerate the maturity of FDIC-guaranteed notes for so long as we or the FDIC are making timely payments of interest and principal.
Guarantee.
Under the TLG program, we may not use the proceeds from the offering of the notes guaranteed by the FDIC under the TLG program to prepay indebtedness that is not guaranteed by the FDIC.
Use of Proceeds.
We have appointed the senior trustee as the authorized representative to take action on behalf of holders of the notes guaranteed under the TLG program (the "TLGP representative"). The TLGP representative has agreed to make a demand of the FDIC upon our failure to pay interest or principal on the notes when due. As provided in the FDIC's regulations, a holder will also have the option to elect not to be represented by the TLGP representative. Upon our failure to pay interest or principal, the TLGP representative and a holder that has elected not to be so represented must follow the FDIC's required procedures for making a demand under the guarantee.
Claims Process.
In addition to the procedures described below, the TLGP representative will be required when making a demand, to the extent not previously provided in the master agreement, to provide the FDIC with information regarding its authority, including: its financial and organizational capacity to act as
 
representative, its exclusive authority to act on behalf of each holder of the notes and its fiduciary responsibility to the holder of the notes when acting as such, as established by the senior indenture, and its authority to make the assignment of each holder's right, title, and interest in the notes to the FDIC.
Any demand under the guarantee must be accompanied by a proof of claim, satisfactory in form and content to the FDIC, which includes evidence of the occurrence of a payment default and the claimant's ownership of the applicable notes. Upon the commencement of guarantee payments by the FDIC, the claimant must provide to the FDIC an assignment, satisfactory in form and content to the FDIC, of the holder's right, title and interest in the notes to the FDIC and the transfer to the FDIC of any payments from us with respect to the notes. The assignment must also grant to the FDIC the right to receive any and all distributions on the note from the proceeds of any bankruptcy. If a holder receives a payment on a note from a bankruptcy, any obligation of the FDIC under the guarantee would be reduced proportionally. Demands must be made by the TLGP representative or by a holder of the notes that elects not to be represented by the TLGP representative within 60 days of the occurrence of the payment default.
Upon payment by the FDIC of any amount under the guarantee, the FDIC will be subrogated to the rights of the recipient holder of the notes against us, including in respect of any insolvency proceeding, to the extent of such payment.
In addition to the appointment of the senior trustee as authorized representative for the holders of the notes, the master agreement requires additional provisions that are included in a supplement to the senior indenture that will govern the notes, including:
Indenture Supplement.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Supplemental Risk Factors
For more information regarding risks that may materially affect our business and results, please refer to the information under the caption "Item 1A. Risk Factors," in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.
If we fail to make a payment of interest or principal on FDIC-guaranteed notes, your notes will be governed by the rules of the TLG program.
If we fail to make a payment of interest or principal, you will be required to follow the regulations of the TLG program, which supersede your rights under the senior indenture as described in the prospectus for the notes. We have appointed the senior trustee as the TLGP representative under a supplemental indenture for the FDIC-guaranteed notes. The authorized representative will be responsible, upon our failure to make a required payment of interest or principal, to make a demand of the FDIC under the guarantee. In addition, any holder of FDIC-guaranteed notes may elect to not be so represented, as provided by the terms of the TLG program. If a holder of FDIC-guaranteed makes the decision to represent itself under the applicable regulations, it will be required to provide the proof of claim and other documentation, in form and content satisfactory to the FDIC, necessary to receive payment under the guarantee. If a demand is not made under the TLG program by the authorized representative within 60 days of our failure to pay interest or principal, the obligations of the FDIC will terminate as to the FDIC-guaranteed notes and the holder of FDIC-guaranteed notes will have no rights against the FDIC for the guaranteed amount.
Payments by the FDIC under its guarantee may be delayed.
There is no designated period within which the FDIC is required to make the guarantee payments after it receives the required written demand. As a result, if the FDIC is required to make such payments, they could be paid at a time that is significantly later than the date that the payment is otherwise due under the terms of the FDIC-guaranteed notes.
The determination of the FDIC on any matter related to the FDIC claims process will be final and binding on you and us, subject to judicial review.
The determination by the FDIC on any matter relating to the FDIC claims process will be a final administrative determination, which will be final and binding on all concerned, including the holders of the FDIC-guaranteed notes. Holders of the FDIC-guaranteed notes will have the right to challenge the FDIC's determination only by commencing an action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina within 60 days after the FDIC makes its determination.
The TLG program is new and is subject to change.
The TLG program is a new program, and was enacted under final rules that the FDIC adopted effective November 21, 2008. According to the February 10, 2009 Press Release, the TLG program may be extended to guarantee eligible debt issued through October 31, 2009, subject to additional premiums and promulgation of final rules relating to the Financial Stability Plan. To our knowledge, no claims have been made or paid under the TLG program, and the FDIC's procedures under the TLG program have not yet been fully documented. The rules governing the TLG program may be amended, and are subject to evolving interpretation by the FDIC after the date of this term sheet. As a result, your ability to obtain payment on the FDIC-guaranteed notes under the FDIC's guarantee is subject to rules, interpretations,
 
procedures, and practices of the FDIC that could be changed at any time in the future. Any developments of this kind may be adverse to holders of the FDIC-guaranteed notes.
Our summary of the FDIC's guarantee and the risks of purchasing the FDIC-guaranteed notes in reliance on that guarantee, as set forth in this term sheet, are based solely on the final rules adopted by the FDIC as of the date of this term sheet. Purchasers of the FDIC-guaranteed notes should refer to the FDIC's website, www.fdic.gov/tlgp, and the U.S. Treasury website, www.financialstability.gov, for additional information about the TLG program and related claim procedures.

3. The Notes have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authentication by the Trustee, when issued and paid for in accordance with the terms of the Distribution Agreement, the Written Terms Agreement and the Indenture, will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
4. The Master Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming acceptance by the FDIC, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
5. The Registration Statement was automatically effective upon filing pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Securities Act, and we are not aware that any stop order suspending the effectiveness thereof has been issued or any proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened under the Securities Act.

In addition, we have participated in conferences with your representatives, with representatives of the Company, its counsel and its accountants, and with representatives of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. and its accountants prior to the merger, concerning the Registration Statement, each Disclosure Package, and the Prospectus and have considered the matters required to be stated therein and the statements contained therein, although we have not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of such statements (other than as stated in paragraphs 7 and 8 above).

This pricing supplement describes two series of our senior notes that will be issued under our Medium-Term Note Program, Series L. We refer to our Senior Three-Month LIBOR Notes, due June 2012 as the "floating rate notes," and to our 2.375% Senior Notes, due June 2012 as the "fixed rate notes."
 
Both series of notes mature on June 22, 2012. We will pay interest on the floating rate notes for each quarterly interest period at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus a spread of 0.20%, except that the interest rate in effect for the first interest period will be based on an interpolated rate between two-week LIBOR and one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 0.20%. The notes are unsecured and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and senior indebtedness outstanding from time to time. We do not intend to list either series of the notes on any securities exchange.
 
This debt is guaranteed under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program and is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. The details of the FDIC guarantee are provided in the FDIC's regulations, 12 CFR Part 370, and at the FDIC's website, www.fdic.gov/tlgp. The expiration date of the FDIC's guarantee is the earlier of the maturity date of the debt or June 30, 2012.
 
Investing in the notes involves risks. For an explanation of some of these risks, see "Risk Factors" beginning on page S-4 of the attached prospectus supplement, and "Risk Factors" beginning on page 8 of the attached prospectus. The FDIC guarantee is subject to additional risks as described on page PS-6 under the caption "Supplemental Risk Factors."
 
None of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any state securities commission, or any other regulatory body has approved or disapproved of these notes or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this pricing supplement, the attached prospectus supplement, or the attached prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

FDIC Guarantee
 
This section provides summary information regarding the guarantee of the notes by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"). The details of the FDIC's guarantee are provided in the FDIC's regulations, 12 CFR Part 370, and at the FDIC's website, www.fdic.gov/tlgp. The regulations governing the guarantee and the terms and conditions of the guarantee are subject to change. These regulations, terms and conditions are subject to the interpretation of the FDIC, which also may change. The following information is based on the final regulations adopted effective November 21, 2008. In addition, as described in a Press Release dated February 10, 2009 (the "February 10, 2009 Press Release"), the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Chairman of the FDIC, the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision jointly announced a Financial Stability Plan that includes, among other items, a proposal to extend the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (the "TLG program") through October 31, 2009, subject to the payment of additional premiums and the promulgation of final rules relating to the Financial Stability Plan. The February 10, 2009 Press Release indicates that further information will be posted at www.financialstability.gov. The internet addresses provided above are included as inactive textual references only. The information on those websites shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in this pricing supplement.
 
On October 14, 2008, the FDIC created the TLG program, and the FDIC adopted final rules related to the TLG program effective November 21, 2008. Under the TLG program, the FDIC will guarantee the newly-issued senior unsecured debt of participating eligible entities, including insured depository institutions and eligible holding companies of insured depository institutions. We are an eligible entity under the TLG program, and a participant under the TLG program. As a participant, our senior unsecured debt may be guaranteed by the FDIC if it satisfies the TLG program's criteria. From time to time, we may issue debt securities that are not eligible for the FDIC guarantee and that will not be guaranteed. We will provide purchasers of our debt instruments with a written statement indicating if the debt instruments we are offering are FDIC-guaranteed under the TLG program.
TLG Program.
 
As a participant in the TLG program, we are eligible to issue FDIC-guaranteed debt up to an issuance limit, provided we comply with the terms and conditions of the TLG program, including payment of fees, delivery of notice to the FDIC of the issuance of guaranteed debt, providing certain disclosures, and certification to the FDIC that such issuance is within our issuance limit. As required by the TLG program, we have entered into a master agreement with the FDIC that governs certain aspects of the TLG program. If we are not in compliance with the TLG program, we would be unable to issue additional FDIC-guaranteed debt; however, the outstanding FDIC-guaranteed notes would not lose the benefit of the FDIC guarantee. Under the final rules as of the date of this pricing supplement, the TLG program guarantees eligible debt issued through or prior to June 30, 2009 that matures on or prior to June 30, 2012. According to the February 10, 2009 Press Release, the TLG program may be extended to guarantee eligible debt issued on or prior to October 31, 2009.
 
The notes are our senior unsecured debt obligations, are guaranteed by the FDIC under the TLG program, and are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. If we fail to pay interest or principal when due on either series of the notes, the FDIC will pay holders of those notes the unpaid, then due amount of interest or principal. An event of default under the senior indenture, including a payment default, will not entitle the holders of the notes or the TLGP Representative (defined below) to accelerate the maturity of either series of the FDIC-guaranteed notes for so long as we or the FDIC are making timely payments of interest and principal.
Guarantee.
 
Under the TLG program, we may not use the proceeds from the offering of the notes guaranteed by the FDIC under the TLG program to prepay indebtedness that is not guaranteed by the FDIC.
Use of Proceeds.
 
Claims Process.
We have appointed the senior trustee as the authorized representative under the TLG program (the "TLGP representative") to take action on behalf of holders of each series of the notes
 
guaranteed under the TLG program. The TLGP representative has agreed to make a demand of the FDIC upon our failure to pay interest or principal on either series of the notes when due. As provided in the FDIC's regulations, a holder of the notes will also have the option to elect not to be represented by the TLGP representative. Upon our failure to pay interest or principal, the TLGP representative and a holder of the notes that has elected not to be so represented must follow the FDIC's required procedures for making a demand under the guarantee.
 
In addition to the procedures described below, the TLGP representative will be required when making a demand, to the extent not previously provided in the master agreement, to provide the FDIC with information regarding its authority, including: its financial and organizational capacity to act as representative, its exclusive authority to act on behalf of each holder of the notes and its fiduciary responsibility to the holder of the notes when acting as such, as established by the senior indenture, and its authority to make the assignment of each holder's right, title, and interest in the notes to the FDIC.
 
Any demand under the guarantee must be accompanied by a proof of claim, satisfactory in form and content to the FDIC, which includes evidence of the occurrence of a payment default and the claimant's ownership of the applicable notes. Upon the commencement of guarantee payments by the FDIC, the claimant must provide to the FDIC an assignment, satisfactory in form and content to the FDIC, of the holder's right, title and interest in the notes to the FDIC and the transfer to the FDIC of any payments from us with respect to the notes. The assignment must also grant to the FDIC the right to receive any and all distributions on the note from the proceeds of any bankruptcy. If a holder receives a payment on a note from a bankruptcy, any obligation of the FDIC under the guarantee would be reduced proportionally. Demands must be made by the TLGP representative or by a holder of the notes that elects not to be represented by the TLGP representative within 60 days of the occurrence of the payment default.
 
Upon payment by the FDIC of any amount under the guarantee, the FDIC will be subrogated to the rights of the recipient holder of the notes against us, including in respect of any insolvency proceeding, to the extent of such payment.
 
In addition to the appointment of the senior trustee as TLGP representative for the holders of the notes, the master agreement requires additional provisions that are included in a supplement to the senior indenture that will govern each series of the notes, including:

Supplemental Risk Factors
 
You should review carefully the information in this pricing supplement and the attached prospectus supplement and prospectus about the FDIC-guaranteed notes. For more information regarding risks that may materially affect our business and results, please refer to the information filed by us with the SEC under the caption "Item 1A. Risk Factors," in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, which is incorporated by reference in this pricing supplement.
 
If we fail to make a payment of interest or principal on FDIC-guaranteed notes, your notes will be governed by the rules of the TLG program.
 
If we fail to make a payment of interest or principal, you will be required to follow the regulations of the TLG program, which supersede your rights under the senior indenture as described in the prospectus. We have appointed the senior trustee as the TLGP representative under a supplemental indenture for the FDIC-guaranteed notes. The TLGP representative will be responsible, upon our failure to make a required payment of interest or principal, to make a demand of the FDIC under the guarantee. In addition, any holder of FDIC-guaranteed notes may elect to not be so represented, as provided by the terms of the TLG program. If a holder of FDIC-guaranteed notes makes the decision to represent itself under the applicable regulations, it will be required to provide the proof of claim and other documentation, in form and content satisfactory to the FDIC, necessary to receive payment under the guarantee. If a demand is not made under the TLG program by the TLGP representative within 60 days of our failure to pay interest or principal, the obligations of the FDIC will terminate as to the applicable series of the FDIC-guaranteed notes and the holder of FDIC-guaranteed notes will have no rights against the FDIC for the guaranteed amount.
 
Payments by the FDIC under its guarantee may be delayed.
 
There is no designated period within which the FDIC is required to make the guarantee payments after it receives the required written demand. As a result, if the FDIC is required to make such payments, they could be paid at a time that is significantly later than the date that the payment is otherwise due under the terms of the FDIC-guaranteed notes.
 
The determination of the FDIC on any matter related to the FDIC claims process will be final and binding on you and us, subject to judicial review.
 
The determination by the FDIC on any matter relating to the FDIC claims process will be a final administrative determination, which will be final and binding on all concerned, including the holders of the applicable series of the FDIC-guaranteed notes. Holders of the FDIC-guaranteed notes will have the right to challenge the FDIC's determination only by commencing an action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina within 60 days after the FDIC makes its determination.
 
The TLG program is new and is subject to change.
 
The TLG program is a new program, and was enacted under final rules that the FDIC adopted effective November 21, 2008. According to the February 10, 2009 Press Release, the TLG program may be extended to guarantee eligible debt issued on or prior to October 31, 2009, subject to the payment of additional premiums and the promulgation of final rules relating to the Financial Stability Plan. To our knowledge, no claims have been made or paid under the TLG program, and the FDIC's procedures under the TLG program have not yet been fully documented. The rules governing the TLG program may be amended, and are subject to evolving interpretation by the FDIC after the date of this pricing supplement. As a result, your ability to obtain payment on the FDIC-guaranteed notes under the FDIC's guarantee is subject to rules, interpretations, procedures, and practices of the FDIC that could be changed at any time in the future. Any developments of this kind may be adverse to holders of the FDIC-guaranteed notes.
 
Our summary of the FDIC's guarantee and the risks of purchasing the FDIC-guaranteed notes in reliance on that guarantee, as set forth in this pricing supplement, are based solely on the final rules adopted by the FDIC as of the date appearing on the front cover. Purchasers of the FDIC-guaranteed notes should refer to the FDIC's website, www.fdic.gov/tlgp, and the U.S. Treasury website, www.financialstability.gov, for additional information about the TLG program and related claim procedures.
 
Supplemental Information Concerning the Plan of Distribution
 
On March 9, 2009, we entered into an agreement with the selling agents identified below for the purchase and sale of the notes. We have agreed to sell to each of the selling agents, and each of the selling agents has agreed to purchase from us, the principal amount of the notes shown opposite its name in the table below at the applicable public offering price set forth above.
 
 
The selling agents may sell each series of the notes to certain dealers at the applicable public offering price, less a concession which will not exceed 0.15% of their principal amount. The selling agents and those dealers may resell the notes to other dealers at a reallowance discount which will not exceed 0.10% of their principal amount.
 
After the initial offering of the notes, the concessions and reallowance discounts for either series of the notes may change.
 
We estimate that the total offering expenses for the notes, excluding the selling agents' commissions, will be approximately $425,000. In addition, we will pay an assessment fee at an equivalent rate of 100 basis points per annum on the principal amount of the notes to the FDIC for the FDIC's guarantee.

SECTION 1. This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of senior notes of the Issuer to be issued in one or more series under the Indenture dated January 1, 1995, as supplemented from time to time (the "Indenture"), between Bank of America Corporation (the "Issuer") and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (the "Trustee"), and to which Indenture reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Issuer and the Trustee thereunder and the holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The term Trustee shall include any additional or successor trustee or agents appointed in such capacity by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.
General.
This Note is one of the Notes issued pursuant to the Prospectus Supplement dated April 10, 2008 to the Prospectus dated May 5, 2006 (referred to collectively herein as the "Prospectus") for the offer and sale of the Issuer's senior and subordinated medium-term notes, Series L (the "Notes"). The Notes may have different issue and maturity dates, bear interest at different rates and vary in such other ways as provided in the Indenture and described in the Prospectus. The specific terms of each issuance of Notes will be described in a Pricing Supplement.
The Issuer has initially appointed the Trustee to act as the U.S. Issuing and Paying Agent, Security Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes. This Note may be presented or surrendered for payment, and notices, designations or requests in respect of payments with respect to this Note may be served, at the corporate trust office of the Trustee, located at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York, 10286, or such other location as may be specified by the Trustee and notified to the Issuer and the registered holder of this Note.
The Trustee has been designated as the duly authorized representative of the holder of the Notes for purposes of making claims and taking other permitted or required actions under the TLG Program (the "Representative"). Any Holder may elect not to be represented by the Representative by providing written notice of such election to the Representative.
Unless specified otherwise in the Pricing Supplement, this Note will not be subject to a sinking fund.
SECTION 2. .
Interest Provisions
(a) .
Fixed Rate Notes
Intentionally omitted.
 
(b) . The Issuer will pay interest on the principal amount specified on the face of this Note (as adjusted in accordance with Schedule 1 hereto) on each Interest Payment Date specified in the Pricing Supplement and at Maturity, commencing on the first Interest Payment Date succeeding the Original Issue Date specified above, until payment of such principal sum has been made or duly provided for.
Floating Rate Notes
Payments of interest hereon will include interest accrued from, and including, the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest on this Note (or any predecessor Note) has been paid or duly provided for (or, unless otherwise specified in the Pricing Supplement, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for, from, and including, the Original Issue Date) to, but excluding, the relevant Interest Payment Date or Maturity Date, as the case may be (each such period, an "Interest Period").
The Base Rate (as defined herein) with respect to this Note is the London interbank offered rate, or "LIBOR."
Except as described below, this Note will bear interest at the rate determined by reference to the appropriate interest rate basis (the "Base Rate") and Index Maturity, each as specified in the Pricing Supplement, plus the Spread specified in the Pricing Supplement. The interest rate in effect during an Interest Period will be the rate determined by the Calculation Agent specified in the Pricing Supplement on the "calculation date" by reference to the Interest Determination Date (as described below).
The "calculation date" pertaining to any Interest Determination Date will be the date by which the Calculation Agent specified in the Pricing Supplement computes the amount of interest owed on this Note for the related Interest Period. Unless otherwise specified in the Pricing Supplement, the "calculation date" will be the earlier of (a) the tenth calendar day after the related Interest Determination Date or, if that date is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day; or (b) the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or the Stated Maturity Date or the date of redemption or the date of prepayment, as the case may be.
The interest rate in effect on each day shall be (a) if such day is an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date pertaining to such Interest Reset Date or (b) if such day is not an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the immediately preceding Interest Reset Date. Unless otherwise specified herein or in the Pricing Supplement, if any Interest Reset Date specified in the Pricing Supplement (including the Initial Interest Reset Date, as specified in the Pricing Supplement) falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that, if the next Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, the Interest Reset Date will be the immediately preceding Business Day. The Interest Reset Dates are subject to adjustment as described below.
The "Interest Determination Date" will be the second London Banking Day preceding the related Interest Reset Date.
 
Unless otherwise specified in the Pricing Supplement, if any Interest Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the related payment of interest will be made on the next succeeding Business Day. However, if an Interest Payment Date falls on a date that is not a Business Day, and the next Business Day is in the next calendar month, the Interest Payment Date will be the immediately preceding Business Day. In each such case, except for the Interest Payment Date falling on the Maturity Date, the Interest Periods and the Interest Reset Dates will be adjusted accordingly to calculate the amount of interest payable on this Note. Unless otherwise specified in the Pricing Supplement, if the Maturity Date of this Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the related payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, this Note will be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date such payments were due, and no additional interest will accrue in respect of the amount so payable for the period from and after the Maturity Date.
Accrued interest on this Note is calculated by multiplying the principal amount of the Note by an accrued interest factor. The accrued interest factor is the sum of the interest factors calculated for each day in the period for which accrued interest is being calculated. The daily interest factor will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the Interest Period divided by 360.
All amounts used in or resulting from any calculation on this Note will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent or more being rounded upward. Unless otherwise specified in the Pricing Supplement, all percentages resulting from any calculation are rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percent, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward. For example, 9.876545% (or .09876545) will be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655).
Notwithstanding the calculations determined as specified below, the interest rate hereon shall not be greater than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or less than the Minimum Interest Rate, if any, specified in the Pricing Supplement.
The Calculation Agent shall calculate the interest rate hereon in accordance with the procedures described below on or before each calculation date. At the request of the registered holder hereof, the Calculation Agent will provide to such holder the interest rate hereon then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate which will become effective as of the next Interest Reset Date.
. LIBOR for any Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the offered rates for deposits in the relevant Index Currency having the Index Maturity described in the Pricing Supplement, commencing on the related Interest Reset Date, as the rates appear on the LIBOR Reuters page designated in the Pricing Supplement as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on that Interest Determination Date, if at least two offered rates appear on the designated LIBOR page, except that, if the designated LIBOR Reuters page only provides for a single rate, that single rate will be used.
Determination of LIBOR
If fewer than two of the rates described above appears on that page or no rate appears on any page on which only one rate normally appears, then the Calculation Agent will determine LIBOR as follows:

New Notes so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Issuer, to any provisions contained in any such modification, amendment or supplement may be prepared by the Issuer, authenticated by the Trustee and delivered in exchange for this Note.
SECTION 9.

Obligations Unconditional.
SECTION 10. The Issuer may not consolidate or merge with or into any other person, or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any person, unless (i) the resulting or acquiring entity, if other than the Issuer, is organized and validly existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, and shall expressly assume all the Issuer's obligations under the Indenture; and (ii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, the Issuer (or any resulting or acquiring entity, if other than the Issuer) is not in default in the performance of any covenant or condition under the Indenture.
Successor to Issuer.
Upon consolidation, merger, sale or transfer as described above, the resulting or acquiring entity shall be substituted for the Issuer in the Indenture with the same effect as if it had been an original party to the Indenture, and the successor entity may exercise the Issuer's right and powers under the Indenture.
SECTION 11. This Note, and any Note issued in exchange or substitution herefor or in place hereof, or upon registration of transfer, exchange or partial redemption or repayment of this Note, may be issued only in an Authorized Denomination as specified in the Pricing Supplement.

Registration of Transfer.
 
This Note may be exchanged in whole, but not in part, for security-printed definitive Notes, only under the circumstances described in the Indenture and (a) The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depository for the DTC global note or DTC ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, if so required by applicable law or regulation, and, in either case, a successor depository is not appointed by the Issuer within 90 days after receiving such notice or becoming aware that DTC is no longer so registered; or (b) the Issuer, in its sole discretion, elects to issue definitive registered notes; or (c) after the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to this Note, beneficial owners representing a majority in principal amount of the Notes represented by this Note advise the relevant clearing system through its participants to cease acting as a depository for this Note.
In any such instance, an owner of a beneficial interest in this Note will be entitled to physical delivery in definitive form of Notes equal in principal amount to such beneficial interest and to have such Notes registered in its name. Unless otherwise set forth above, Notes so issued in definitive form will be issued in Authorized Denominations only and will be issued in registered form only, without coupons.
Subject to the terms of the Indenture, if the Notes are held in definitive form, a holder may exchange its Notes for other Notes of the same series in an equal aggregate principal amount and in Authorized Denominations.
Notes in definitive form may be presented for registration of transfer at the office of the Security Registrar or at the office of any transfer agent that the Issuer may designate and maintain. The Security Registrar or the transfer agent will make the transfer or registration only if it is satisfied with the documents of title and identity of the person making the request. The Issuer may change the Security Registrar or the transfer agent or approve a change in the location through which the Security Registrar or transfer agent acts at any time, except that the Issuer will be required to maintain a security registrar and transfer agent in each place of payment for the Notes of this series. At any time, the Issuer may designate additional transfer agents for the Notes of this series.
The Issuer will not be required to (a) issue, exchange, or register the transfer of this Note if it has exercised its right to redeem the Notes of the series of which this Note is a part for a period of 15 calendar days before the redemption date, or (b) exchange or register the transfer of any Notes of the series of which this Note is a part that were selected, called, or are being called for redemption, except the unredeemed portion of the Notes of the series of which this Note is a part, if being redeemed in part.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Issuer, the Trustee, and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may treat the person in whose name this Note is

This pricing supplement describes two series of our senior notes that will be issued under our Medium-Term Note Program, Series L. We refer to our Senior Three-Month LIBOR Notes, due June 2012 as the "floating rate notes," and to our 2.375% Senior Notes, due June 2012 as the "fixed rate notes."
 
Both series of notes mature on June 22, 2012. We will pay interest on the floating rate notes for each quarterly interest period at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus a spread of 0.20%, except that the interest rate in effect for the first interest period will be based on an interpolated rate between two-week LIBOR and one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 0.20%. The notes are unsecured and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and senior indebtedness outstanding from time to time. We do not intend to list either series of the notes on any securities exchange.
 
This debt is guaranteed under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program and is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. The details of the FDIC guarantee are provided in the FDIC's regulations, 12 CFR Part 370, and at the FDIC's website, www.fdic.gov/tlgp. The expiration date of the FDIC's guarantee is the earlier of the maturity date of the debt or June 30, 2012.
 
Investing in the notes involves risks. For an explanation of some of these risks, see "Risk Factors" beginning on page S-4 of the attached prospectus supplement, and "Risk Factors" beginning on page 8 of the attached prospectus. The FDIC guarantee is subject to additional risks as described on page PS-6 under the caption "Supplemental Risk Factors."

FDIC Guarantee
 
This section provides summary information regarding the guarantee of the notes by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"). The details of the FDIC's guarantee are provided in the FDIC's regulations, 12 CFR Part 370, and at the FDIC's website, www.fdic.gov/tlgp. The regulations governing the guarantee and the terms and conditions of the guarantee are subject to change. These regulations, terms and conditions are subject to the interpretation of the FDIC, which also may change. The following information is based on the final regulations adopted effective November 21, 2008. In addition, as described in a Press Release dated February 10, 2009 (the "February 10, 2009 Press Release"), the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Chairman of the FDIC, the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision jointly announced a Financial Stability Plan that includes, among other items, a proposal to extend the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (the "TLG program") through October 31, 2009, subject to the payment of additional premiums and the promulgation of final rules relating to the Financial Stability Plan. The February 10, 2009 Press Release indicates that further information will be posted at www.financialstability.gov. The internet addresses provided above are included as inactive textual references only. The information on those websites shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in this pricing supplement.
 
On October 14, 2008, the FDIC created the TLG program, and the FDIC adopted final rules related to the TLG program effective November 21, 2008. Under the TLG program, the FDIC will guarantee the newly-issued senior unsecured debt of participating eligible entities, including insured depository institutions and eligible holding companies of insured depository institutions. We are an eligible entity under the TLG program, and a participant under the TLG program. As a participant, our senior unsecured debt may be guaranteed by the FDIC if it satisfies the TLG program's criteria. From time to time, we may issue debt securities that are not eligible for the FDIC guarantee and that will not be guaranteed. We will provide purchasers of our debt instruments with a written statement indicating if the debt instruments we are offering are FDIC-guaranteed under the TLG program.
TLG Program.
 
As a participant in the TLG program, we are eligible to issue FDIC-guaranteed debt up to an issuance limit, provided we comply with the terms and conditions of the TLG program, including payment of fees, delivery of notice to the FDIC of the issuance of guaranteed debt, providing certain disclosures, and certification to the FDIC that such issuance is within our issuance limit. As required by the TLG program, we have entered into a master agreement with the FDIC that governs certain aspects of the TLG program. If we are not in compliance with the TLG program, we would be unable to issue additional FDIC-guaranteed debt; however, the outstanding FDIC-guaranteed notes would not lose the benefit of the FDIC guarantee. Under the final rules as of the date of this pricing supplement, the TLG program guarantees eligible debt issued through or prior to June 30, 2009 that matures on or prior to June 30, 2012. According to the February 10, 2009 Press Release, the TLG program may be extended to guarantee eligible debt issued on or prior to October 31, 2009.
 
The notes are our senior unsecured debt obligations, are guaranteed by the FDIC under the TLG program, and are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. If we fail to pay interest or principal when due on either series of the notes, the FDIC will pay holders of those notes the unpaid, then due amount of interest or principal. An event of default under the senior indenture, including a payment default, will not entitle the holders of the notes or the TLGP Representative (defined below) to accelerate the maturity of either series of the FDIC-guaranteed notes for so long as we or the FDIC are making timely payments of interest and principal.
Guarantee.
 
Under the TLG program, we may not use the proceeds from the offering of the notes guaranteed by the FDIC under the TLG program to prepay indebtedness that is not guaranteed by the FDIC.
Use of Proceeds.
 
Claims Process.
We have appointed the senior trustee as the authorized representative under the TLG program (the "TLGP representative") to take action on behalf of holders of each series of the notes
 
guaranteed under the TLG program. The TLGP representative has agreed to make a demand of the FDIC upon our failure to pay interest or principal on either series of the notes when due. As provided in the FDIC's regulations, a holder of the notes will also have the option to elect not to be represented by the TLGP representative. Upon our failure to pay interest or principal, the TLGP representative and a holder of the notes that has elected not to be so represented must follow the FDIC's required procedures for making a demand under the guarantee.
 
In addition to the procedures described below, the TLGP representative will be required when making a demand, to the extent not previously provided in the master agreement, to provide the FDIC with information regarding its authority, including: its financial and organizational capacity to act as representative, its exclusive authority to act on behalf of each holder of the notes and its fiduciary responsibility to the holder of the notes when acting as such, as established by the senior indenture, and its authority to make the assignment of each holder's right, title, and interest in the notes to the FDIC.
 
Any demand under the guarantee must be accompanied by a proof of claim, satisfactory in form and content to the FDIC, which includes evidence of the occurrence of a payment default and the claimant's ownership of the applicable notes. Upon the commencement of guarantee payments by the FDIC, the claimant must provide to the FDIC an assignment, satisfactory in form and content to the FDIC, of the holder's right, title and interest in the notes to the FDIC and the transfer to the FDIC of any payments from us with respect to the notes. The assignment must also grant to the FDIC the right to receive any and all distributions on the note from the proceeds of any bankruptcy. If a holder receives a payment on a note from a bankruptcy, any obligation of the FDIC under the guarantee would be reduced proportionally. Demands must be made by the TLGP representative or by a holder of the notes that elects not to be represented by the TLGP representative within 60 days of the occurrence of the payment default.
 
Upon payment by the FDIC of any amount under the guarantee, the FDIC will be subrogated to the rights of the recipient holder of the notes against us, including in respect of any insolvency proceeding, to the extent of such payment.
 
In addition to the appointment of the senior trustee as TLGP representative for the holders of the notes, the master agreement requires additional provisions that are included in a supplement to the senior indenture that will govern each series of the notes, including:
Indenture Supplement.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
U.S. Federal Income Taxes
 
For a brief description of the tax effects of an investment in the notes, see "U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations" on page S-12 of the attached prospectus supplement and page 61 of the attached prospectus.
 
Supplemental Risk Factors
 
You should review carefully the information in this pricing supplement and the attached prospectus supplement and prospectus about the FDIC-guaranteed notes. For more information regarding risks that may materially affect our business and results, please refer to the information filed by us with the SEC under the caption "Item 1A. Risk Factors," in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, which is incorporated by reference in this pricing supplement.
 
If we fail to make a payment of interest or principal on FDIC-guaranteed notes, your notes will be governed by the rules of the TLG program.
 
If we fail to make a payment of interest or principal, you will be required to follow the regulations of the TLG program, which supersede your rights under the senior indenture as described in the prospectus. We have appointed the senior trustee as the TLGP representative under a supplemental indenture for the FDIC-guaranteed notes. The TLGP representative will be responsible, upon our failure to make a required payment of interest or principal, to make a demand of the FDIC under the guarantee. In addition, any holder of FDIC-guaranteed notes may elect to not be so represented, as provided by the terms of the TLG program. If a holder of FDIC-guaranteed notes makes the decision to represent itself under the applicable regulations, it will be required to provide the proof of claim and other documentation, in form and content satisfactory to the FDIC, necessary to receive payment under the guarantee. If a demand is not made under the TLG program by the TLGP representative within 60 days of our failure to pay interest or principal, the obligations of the FDIC will terminate as to the applicable series of the FDIC-guaranteed notes and the holder of FDIC-guaranteed notes will have no rights against the FDIC for the guaranteed amount.
 
Payments by the FDIC under its guarantee may be delayed.
 
There is no designated period within which the FDIC is required to make the guarantee payments after it receives the required written demand. As a result, if the FDIC is required to make such payments, they could be paid at a time that is significantly later than the date that the payment is otherwise due under the terms of the FDIC-guaranteed notes.
 
The determination of the FDIC on any matter related to the FDIC claims process will be final and binding on you and us, subject to judicial review.
 
The determination by the FDIC on any matter relating to the FDIC claims process will be a final administrative determination, which will be final and binding on all concerned, including the holders of the applicable series of the FDIC-guaranteed notes. Holders of the FDIC-guaranteed notes will have the right to challenge the FDIC's determination only by commencing an action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina within 60 days after the FDIC makes its determination.
 
The TLG program is new and is subject to change.
 
The TLG program is a new program, and was enacted under final rules that the FDIC adopted effective November 21, 2008. According to the February 10, 2009 Press Release, the TLG program may be extended to guarantee eligible debt issued on or prior to October 31, 2009, subject to the payment of additional premiums and the promulgation of final rules relating to the Financial Stability Plan. To our knowledge, no claims have been made or paid under the TLG program, and the FDIC's procedures under the TLG program have not yet been fully documented. The rules governing the TLG program may be amended, and are subject to evolving interpretation by the FDIC after the date of this pricing supplement. As a result, your ability to obtain payment on the FDIC-guaranteed notes under the FDIC's guarantee is subject to rules, interpretations, procedures, and practices of the FDIC that could be changed at any time in the future. Any developments of this kind may be adverse to holders of the FDIC-guaranteed notes.
 
Our summary of the FDIC's guarantee and the risks of purchasing the FDIC-guaranteed notes in reliance on that guarantee, as set forth in this pricing supplement, are based solely on the final rules adopted by the FDIC as of the date appearing on the front cover. Purchasers of the FDIC-guaranteed notes should refer to the FDIC's website, www.fdic.gov/tlgp, and the U.S. Treasury website, www.financialstability.gov, for additional information about the TLG program and related claim procedures.
 
Supplemental Information Concerning the Plan of Distribution
 
On March 9, 2009, we entered into an agreement with the selling agents identified below for the purchase and sale of the notes. We have agreed to sell to each of the selling agents, and each of the selling agents has agreed to purchase from us, the principal amount of the notes shown opposite its name in the table below at the applicable public offering price set forth above.
 
 
The selling agents may sell each series of the notes to certain dealers at the applicable public offering price, less a concession which will not exceed 0.15% of their principal amount. The selling agents and those dealers may resell the notes to other dealers at a reallowance discount which will not exceed 0.10% of their principal amount.
 
After the initial offering of the notes, the concessions and reallowance discounts for either series of the notes may change.
 
We estimate that the total offering expenses for the notes, excluding the selling agents' commissions, will be approximately $425,000. In addition, we will pay an assessment fee at an equivalent rate of 100 basis points per annum on the principal amount of the notes to the FDIC for the FDIC's guarantee.
 
Additional Selling Restrictions
 
In addition to the representations, agreements, and restrictions set forth in the attached prospectus supplement under "Supplemental Plan of DistributionSelling Restrictions," the following representations, agreements, and restrictions will apply to the notes.

Successor to Issuer.
Upon consolidation, merger, sale or transfer as described above, the resulting or acquiring entity shall be substituted for the Issuer in the Indenture with the same effect as if it had been an original party to the Indenture, and the successor entity may exercise the Issuer's right and powers under the Indenture.
