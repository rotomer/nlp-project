ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS
     Bank of America Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Bank of America"), is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K for the purpose of updating the description of its Common Stock and Preferred Stock (each, as defined below). That description has been filed previously with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended), and updated and amended from time to time. To the extent the following description is inconsistent with prior filings, it modifies and supersedes those filings.
     
The statements in this description of Bank of America capital stock are brief summaries of, and are subject to the provisions of, Bank of America's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, preferred stock certificates of designation and the relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law.
Description of Common Stock
     Under Bank of America's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation"), Bank of America has 10 billion shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), authorized for issuance. Approximately 6.40 billion shares of Common Stock were outstanding on March 31, 2009. The Common Stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "BAC." The Common Stock also is listed on the London Stock Exchange, and certain shares of the Common Stock are listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. As of March 31, 2009, approximately 1.22 billion shares of Common Stock were reserved for issuance in connection with various Bank of America employee and director benefit plans, the conversion of Bank of America's outstanding convertible securities and other purposes. After taking into account the reserved shares of Common Stock, Bank of America had approximately 2.38 billion authorized shares of Common Stock available for issuance as of March 31, 2009.
Voting and Other Rights
     Holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share. Generally, a director is elected if the votes cast for the nominee's election exceed the votes cast against the nominee's election. However, the directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any stockholders' meeting for which the secretary of Bank of America receives a notice that a stockholder has nominated a person for election as a director in compliance with Bank of America's advance notice requirements for stockholder nominees and such nomination has not been timely withdrawn. There are no cumulative voting rights.
     In general, a majority of votes cast on a matter is sufficient to take action upon routine matters; however, (1) amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding stock; and (2) a merger or dissolution of Bank of America or the sale of all or substantially all of Bank of

America's assets must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the then-outstanding voting shares.
     In the event of Bank of America's liquidation, holders of Common Stock will be entitled to receive pro rata any assets legally available for distribution to Bank of America stockholders, subject to any prior rights of any Preferred Stock then outstanding.
     The Common Stock does not have any preemptive rights, redemption privileges, sinking fund privileges, or conversion rights. All the outstanding shares of Common Stock are, and upon proper conversion of any convertible securities, all of the shares of Common Stock into which these securities are converted will be, validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable.
     Computershare Trust Company, N.A. is the transfer agent and registrar for the Common Stock.
Dividends
     Subject to the preferential rights of any holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, the holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends or distributions, whether payable in cash or otherwise, as the Bank of America board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for these payments. Stock dividends, if any are declared, may be paid from authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock.
     Bank of America's ability to pay dividends on its Common Stock is limited by the terms of the Series N Preferred Stock, Series Q Preferred Stock, and Series R Preferred Stock (each, as defined below) which were issued under the Troubled Asset Relief Program ("TARP"). Such restrictions are fully described under "Series N Preferred Stock," "Series Q Preferred Stock," and "Series R Preferred Stock" below.
     As a bank holding company, the ability of Bank of America to pay dividends will be affected by the ability of its banking subsidiaries to pay dividends. The ability of such banking subsidiaries, as well as of Bank of America, to pay dividends in the future currently is, and could be further, influenced by bank regulatory requirements and capital guidelines.
Description of Preferred Stock
     Bank of America has 100 million shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Preferred Stock"), authorized and may issue Preferred Stock in one or more series, each with such preferences, designations, limitations, conversion rights, and other rights as Bank of America may determine.

of those declared dividends, Bank of America will allocate the dividend payments on a pro rata basis among the holders of the shares of Series L Preferred Stock and the holders of any capital stock ranking equally with the Series L Preferred Stock.
     Each share of the Series L Preferred Stock may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into 20 shares of Common Stock (which reflects an initial conversion price of $50.00 per share of Common Stock) plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, subject to anti-dilution adjustments.
Conversion Right.
     On or after January 30, 2013, Bank of America may, at its option, at any time or from time to time, cause some or all of the Series L Preferred Stock to be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then-applicable conversion rate if, for 20 trading days during any period of 30 consecutive trading days, the closing price of Common Stock exceeds 130% of the then-applicable conversion price of the Series L Preferred Stock.
Conversion at Our Option.
     If, prior to the conversion date, a make-whole acquisition occurs, Bank of America will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate in respect of any conversions of the Series L Preferred Stock that occur during the period beginning on the effective date of the make-whole acquisition and ending on the date that is 30 days after the effective date by a number of additional shares of common stock. The amount of the make-whole adjustment, if any, will be based upon the price per share of the Common Stock and the effective date of the make-whole acquisition. Subject to certain exceptions, a "make-whole acquisition" occurs in the event of (1) the acquisition by a person or group of more than 50% of the voting power of the Common Stock, or (2) Bank of America's consolidation or merger where Bank of America is not the surviving entity.
Conversion Upon Certain Acquisitions.
     In lieu of receiving the make-whole shares described above, if the reference price (as described below) in connection with a make-whole acquisition is less than the applicable conversion price (a "fundamental change"), a holder may elect to convert each share of its Series L Preferred Stock during the period beginning on the effective date of the fundamental change and ending on the date that is 30 days after the effective date of such fundamental change at an adjusted conversion price equal to the greater of (1) the "reference price," which is the price per share of Common Stock paid in the event of a fundamental change, and (2) $19.95, which is 50% of the closing price of Common Stock on January 24, 2008, the date of the initial offering of the Series L Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment (the "base price"). If the reference price is less than the base price, holders of the Series L Preferred Stock will receive a maximum of 50.1253 shares of Common Stock per share of Series L Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment, which may result in a holder receiving value that is less than the liquidation preference of the Series L Preferred Stock.
Conversion Upon Fundamental Change.
     The conversion rate for the Series L Preferred Stock may be adjusted in the event of, among other things, (1) stock dividend distributions, (2) subdivisions, splits, and combinations of Common Stock, (3) issuance of stock purchase rights, (4) debt or asset distributions, (5) increases in cash dividends, and (6) tender or exchange offers for Common Stock.
