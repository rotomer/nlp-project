CHARLOTTE  Bank of America Corporation today reported second-quarter 2009 net income of $3.2 billion. After deducting preferred dividends of $805 million, including $713 million paid to the U.S. government, diluted earnings per share were $0.33.
Those results compared with net income of $3.4 billion, or diluted earnings per share of $0.72 during the year-ago period.
For the first half of 2009, Bank of America earned $7.5 billion, or $0.75 per share.
Results were driven by continued strong revenue performance in the wholesale capital markets businesses as well as in home loans complemented by the previously announced gains on the sale of China Construction Bank (CCB) shares and the sale of the company's merchant processing business to a joint venture. These positives were somewhat offset by continuing high credit costs, including additions to the reserve for loan and lease losses, as well as significant negative credit valuation adjustments on certain liabilities including the Merrill Lynch structured notes and the impact of a special Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) assessment.
Bank of America finished the second quarter with its strongest capital position in recent memory, with a Tier 1 Capital ratio of 11.93 percent as well as a leading liquidity position among global banks.

"Having positive net income in an extremely challenging environment speaks to the diversity and strength of our business model as well as the extraordinary effort put forth by all of our associates," said Kenneth D. Lewis, chief executive officer and president. "Our goals during this difficult time have been to enhance the strength of our balance sheet and capital position and to continue to improve our earning power while dealing with the credit issues facing our industry due to the recession.
"Difficult challenges lie ahead from continued weakness in the global economy, rising unemployment and deteriorating credit quality that will affect our performance for the rest of the year and into 2010," Lewis said. "However, we are convinced that Bank of America will weather the storm and emerge as an acknowledged leader in financial services in the United States and around the world."
"Most importantly, we continue to serve our customers and clients around the world every day, helping them with their accounts, meeting their financial needs and adding new business," Lewis added.

Transition Update
The integration is on track and meeting expected goals. The company in 2009 expects to achieve in excess of 40 percent of the previously announced goal of approximately $7 billion in cost savings, ahead of the original goal of 25 percent for the year.
Merrill Lynch
Since June 1, approximately 6,500 affluent banking-only clients in Bank of America have been referred to Merrill Lynch financial advisors. Of that group, approximately 1,400 now have added an investment relationship with the company. Merrill Lynch financial advisors referred more than 1,100 clients to the commercial bank of Bank of America.
The transition and related cost savings are on track.
Countrywide

Second Quarter 2009 Financial Summary
Revenue and Expense
Revenue net of interest expense on a fully taxable-equivalent basis rose 60 percent to $33.1 billion compared with $20.7 billion a year ago.
Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis rose 9 percent to $11.9 billion from $10.9 billion in the second quarter of 2008 due to an improved rate environment and the addition of Countrywide and Merrill Lynch. These improvements were partially offset by a shift in loan mix and the sale of securities. Net interest yield narrowed 28 basis points to 2.64 percent due to the addition of lower yielding assets from Countrywide and Merrill Lynch, sales of securities, and a shift in loan mix, partially offset by the favorable rate environment.
Noninterest income rose to $21.1 billion from $9.8 billion a year earlier. Higher mortgage banking income, trading account profits and investment and brokerage services income reflected the addition of Merrill Lynch and Countrywide. Additionally, the increase was driven by a $5.3 billion pretax gain on the sale of CCB shares. Bank of America continues to own approximately 11 percent of the common shares of CCB. Noninterest income in the period also included a $3.8 billion pretax gain from the completed sale of the merchant processing business to a joint venture. These increases were partially offset by $3.6 billion in losses related to mark-to-market adjustments on the Merrill Lynch structured notes as a result of narrowing credit spreads during the quarter. Card income declined due to higher credit losses on securitized credit card loans and lower fee income.
Noninterest expense increased to $17.0 billion from $9.7 billion a year earlier. This reflects higher personnel and general operating expenses, driven in part by the Merrill Lynch and Countrywide acquisitions and the FDIC special assessment. Pretax merger and restructuring charges rose to $829 million from $212 million a year earlier.
The efficiency ratio on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was 51.44 percent compared with 46.60 percent a year earlier.
Pretax, pre-provision income on a fully-taxable equivalent basis was $16.1 billion compared with $11.1 billion a year earlier.
Credit Quality
Credit quality deteriorated further as the economic environment weakened. Consumers remained under significant stress as unemployment and underemployment increased and individuals spent longer periods without work. These conditions led to higher losses in almost all consumer portfolios compared with the prior quarter.

Page 5
Declining home values and reduced spending by consumers and businesses negatively impacted the commercial portfolios resulting in broad-based increases in criticized and nonperforming loans. Commercial loan losses rose from the prior quarter as commercial domestic and small business portfolios were impacted in sectors dependent on discretionary consumer spending. Losses in the commercial real estate portfolio also increased.
The provision for credit losses was $13.4 billion, flat with the first quarter. Credit losses were higher than the prior quarter and reserves, which were increased by $4.7 billion, were added across most consumer portfolios and the commercial portfolio reflecting the impact of the weak economy. Nonperforming assets were $31.0 billion compared with $25.6 billion at March 31, 2009, reflecting the continued deterioration in economic conditions. The 2009 coverage ratios and amounts shown in the following table include Merrill Lynch.

Capital Management
Total shareholders' equity was $255.2 billion at June 30. Period-end assets were $2.3 trillion. The Tier 1 Capital ratio was 11.93 percent, up from 10.09 percent at March 31, 2009 and from 8.25 percent a year ago. The Tier 1 Common Ratio was 6.90 percent, compared with 4.49 percent at March 31, 2009 and 4.78 percent at June 30, 2008. The Tangible Common Equity ratio was 4.67 percent, up from 3.13 percent at March 31, 2009 and 3.24 percent a year earlier. Tangible book value per share of common stock was $11.66, compared with $10.88 at March 31, 2009 and $11.87 a year earlier.
During the quarter the bank increased its Tier 1 common capital by nearly $40 billion, easily exceeding the $33.9 billion Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) buffer set by the Federal Reserve in May. Actions contributing toward that goal during the quarter included: issuing shares of common stock; exchanging certain non-government preferred stock for common stock; the sale of a portion of shares in CCB; and the sale of the company's merchant processing business to a joint venture.
During the quarter, Bank of America issued 1.25 billion, or $13.5 billion of common shares. Bank of America exchanged the equivalent of $14.8 billion of non-government preferred shares for approximately 1 billion shares of common stock through private exchanges and a tender offer. A cash dividend of $0.01 per common share was paid. The company recorded $1.4 billion in preferred dividends, partially offset by $576 million related to the exchange of preferred stock in the calculation of net income available to common shareholders. Period-end common shares issued and outstanding were 8.65 billion for the second quarter of 2009, 6.40 billion for the first quarter of 2009 and 4.45 billion for the year-ago quarter.

net income fell 59 percent from a year ago on lower revenue and higher noninterest expense. Revenue declined as a result of lower residual net interest income allocation related to asset and liability management activities and spread compression due to declining interest rates. Noninterest expense rose mainly from the FDIC special assessment.
Deposits
Average customer deposits rose 24 percent, or $79.9 billion, from a year earlier on strong organic growth, the transfer of client deposits from Global Wealth and Investment Management and the acquisition of Countrywide.

swung to a net loss of $1.6 billion as credit costs rose in the weakening economies in the U.S., Europe and Canada. Managed net revenue declined 2 percent to $7.3 billion mainly due to lower fee income partially offset by higher net interest income, as lower funding costs outpaced the decline in average managed loans.
Global Card Services
Provision expense increased to $7.7 billion from a year earlier as the consumer card and consumer lending portfolios deteriorated due to the economic conditions and a rising level of bankruptcies. Also contributing were reserve additions related to maturing securitizations.
Noninterest expense fell 17 percent on lower operating and marketing costs.

The net loss in narrowed as higher revenue was mostly offset by increased credit costs and noninterest expense. Net revenue rose mainly due to the acquisition of Countrywide and higher mortgage banking income as lower interest rates spurred an increase in refinance activity.
Home Loans and Insurance
The provision for credit losses increased to $2.7 billion driven by economic weakness and falling home prices.
Noninterest expense increased to $2.8 billion mostly due to the acquisition of Countrywide.

net income rose to $2.5 billion, benefitting from a $3.8 billion pretax gain generated by the sale of the company's merchant processing business to a joint venture, the addition of Merrill Lynch and strong deposit growth. Higher revenue was partially offset by the challenging credit environment and the FDIC special assessment.
Global Banking
The provision for credit losses increased to $2.6 billion, driven by loan loss reserve increases and higher losses within the commercial domestic portfolio, which were across a broad range of borrowers and industries. Also contributing to the increase were higher losses and reserve additions in the commercial real estate portfolio for deterioration across various property types.

net income increased $1.1 billion. The increase was driven by the addition of Merrill Lynch and lower market disruption related charges of $900 million  a portion of the $1.3 billion total for the company. Net revenue was strong during the period, excluding the credit valuation adjustment on derivative liabilities and market disruption charges, surpassing record first quarter 2009 revenue. Noninterest expense was higher as a result of the addition of Merrill Lynch.

All Other net income increased to $757 million. Higher equity investment income related to the gain on the sale of CCB shares and increased gains on the sale of debt securities were partially offset by fair value adjustments related to certain Merrill Lynch structured notes and other-than-temporary-impairment charges related to non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations. The provision for credit losses rose primarily due to continued deterioration in the residential mortgage portfolio. Noninterest expense increased mostly on merger and restructuring charges related to the Merrill Lynch acquisition.

The Corporation reports on a managed basis. Reporting on a managed basis is consistent with the way that management evaluates the results of . Managed basis assumes that securitized loans were not sold and presents earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold (i.e., held loans) are presented.

Loan securitization is an alternative funding process that is used by the Corporation to diversify funding sources.
Loan securitization removes loans from the Consolidated Balance Sheet through the sale of loans to an off-balance sheet qualified special purpose entity which is excluded from the Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).
The performance of the managed portfolio is important in understanding results as it demonstrates the results of the entire portfolio serviced by the business. Securitized loans continue to be serviced by the business and are subject to the same underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring as held loans. In addition, retained excess servicing income is exposed to similar credit risk and repricing of interest rates as held loans. managed income statement line items differ from a held basis reported as follows:

The Corporation reports on a managed basis. Reporting on a managed basis is consistent with the way that management evaluates the results of . Managed basis assumes that securitized loans were not sold and presents earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold (i.e., held loans) are presented. Loan securitization is an alternative funding process that is used by the Corporation to diversify funding sources. Loan securitization removes loans from the Consolidated Balance Sheet through the sale of loans to an off-balance sheet qualified special purpose entity which is excluded from the Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).

Securitized loans continue to be serviced by the business and are subject to the same underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring as held loans. In addition, retained excess servicing income is exposed to similar credit risk and repricing of interest rates as held loans. managed income statement line items differ from a held basis reported as follows:
