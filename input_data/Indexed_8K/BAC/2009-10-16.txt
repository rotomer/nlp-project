CHARLOTTE  Bank of America Corporation today reported a third-quarter 2009 net loss of $1.0 billion. After deducting preferred dividends of $1.2 billion, including $893 million related to dividends paid to the U.S. government, the diluted loss per share was $0.26.
Those results compared with net income of $1.2 billion, or diluted earnings per share of $0.15, during the year-ago period.
Through the first nine months of the year the company had net income of $6.5 billion, or $0.39 per share after preferred dividends, compared with $5.8 billion, or $1.09 per share a year earlier.

Results were negatively impacted by continued weakness in the U.S. and global economies and stress on the consumer, which continues to result in high credit costs. Earnings in the quarter were affected by $2.6 billion in pretax mark-to-market and credit valuation adjustments on certain liabilities, including the Merrill Lynch structured notes, and a $402 million pretax charge to pay the U.S. government to terminate its asset guarantee term sheet. Despite the loss in the period, the company strengthened its reserves, capital position and liquidity through efficient balance sheet and capital management.
"The company's core performance was impacted by a number of non-core items," said Chief Executive Officer and President Kenneth D. Lewis. "The market's improved view of Bank of America's credit cost the company due to non-cash marks on liabilities.
"Excluding those items, our revenue continued to hold up well," Lewis said. "Obviously, credit costs remain high, and that is our major financial challenge going forward. However, we are heartened by early positive signs, such as the leveling of delinquencies among our credit card customers."

Third-Quarter 2009 Financial Summary
Revenue and Expense
Revenue net of interest expense on a fully taxable-equivalent basis rose 32 percent to $26.4 billion from $19.9 billion a year ago.
 
More
Page 4
 
Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was $11.8 billion compared with $11.9 billion in the third quarter of 2008. The decline was a result of securities sales and lower loan levels. The decrease was partially offset by a favorable rate environment, the addition of Merrill Lynch and higher deposit levels. The net interest yield narrowed 32 basis points to 2.61 percent mainly due to the previously mentioned factors and also was impacted by lower-yielding assets related to the Merrill Lynch acquisition.
Noninterest income rose to $14.6 billion from $8.0 billion a year earlier. Higher trading account profits, investment and brokerage services fees and investment banking income reflected the addition of Merrill Lynch. These increases, as well as gains on the sale of debt securities, were partially offset by $1.8 billion in losses related to mark-to-market adjustments on the Merrill Lynch structured notes, as the company's credit spreads narrowed during the quarter, and $714 million in credit valuation adjustments on derivative liabilities. Card income declined $1.6 billion mainly from higher credit losses on securitized credit card loans and lower fee income.
Noninterest expense increased to $16.3 billion from $11.7 billion a year earlier. Personnel costs and other general operating expenses rose, driven in part by the Merrill Lynch acquisition. The increase was partially offset by a change in compensation that delivers a greater portion of incentive pay over time. The increase also includes the $402 million pretax charge to pay the U.S. government to terminate its asset guarantee term sheet. Pretax merger and restructuring charges rose to $594 million from $247 million a year earlier.
The efficiency ratio on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was 61.84 percent compared with 58.60 percent a year earlier.
Pretax, pre-provision income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was $10.1 billion compared with $8.2 billion a year earlier.
Credit Quality
Deterioration in credit quality slowed compared with the prior quarter, however, credit costs remained high as most economies around the world remained weak. Consumers continued to be under stress as unemployment and underemployment rose and individuals spent longer periods without work. However, the increases in losses slowed in almost all consumer portfolios from the prior quarter.

Declining home and commercial property values and reduced spending by consumers and businesses negatively impacted the commercial portfolios resulting in broad-based increases in criticized and nonperforming loans. The rate of the increases, however, was below the levels experienced in recent quarters. Commercial losses rose from the prior quarter driven primarily by higher charge-offs in the non-homebuilder portion of the commercial real estate portfolio. Higher losses in the commercial domestic portfolio occurred across a broad range of borrowers and industries.
The provision for credit losses was $11.7 billion, $1.7 billion lower than the second quarter and $5.3 billion higher than the same period last year. The addition of $2.1 billion to the reserve for credit losses was lower than the second quarter as delinquencies improved in the unsecured consumer portfolios. This was partially offset by higher reserve additions on the impaired consumer portfolios obtained through acquisitions. Net charge-offs were $923 million higher than the prior quarter, though the pace of the increase slowed. Nonperforming assets were $33.8 billion compared with $31.0 billion at June 30, 2009, reflecting a slower rate of increase than in recent quarters. The 2008 coverage ratios and amounts shown in the following table do not include Merrill Lynch.

net income fell 49 percent from a year ago as revenue declined and noninterest expense rose. Revenue declined as a result of lower residual net interest income allocation related to asset and liability management activities and spread compression due to declining interest rates. Noninterest expense increased as a result of higher FDIC insurance costs.
Deposits
Average customer deposits rose 11 percent, or $40.7 billion, from a year ago due to the transfer of certain client deposits from Global Wealth and Investment Management and strong organic growth. The increase was partially offset by the expected decline in higher-yielding Countrywide deposits.
Global Card Services
 
 
 
The net loss in widened to $1.0 billion as credit costs continued to rise amid weak economies in the U.S., Europe and Canada. Managed net revenue declined 5 percent to $7.3 billion mainly due to lower fee income. The decline was partially offset by higher net interest income, as lower funding costs outpaced the decline in average managed loans.
Global Card Services
The provision for credit losses increased to $7.0 billion from a year earlier due to higher net losses driven by economic conditions and higher bankruptcies. The increase in losses was partially offset by reductions in the reserves as a result of improving delinquencies. This compares with reserve additions in the year-ago quarter.
Noninterest expense fell 18 percent on lower operating and marketing costs.

Home Loans and Insurance
 
 
 
The net loss in widened to $1.6 billion as credit costs continued to increase. Net revenue decreased 2 percent as higher income from loan production was more than offset by lower servicing revenue driven by unfavorable mortgage servicing rights hedge performance.
Home Loans and Insurance
The provision for credit losses increased to $2.9 billion driven by continued economic weakness and lower home prices. Reserves were increased due to further deterioration in the Countrywide purchased impaired portfolio.
Noninterest expense rose to $3.0 billion mostly due to increased compensation costs and other expenses related to higher production volume and higher delinquencies.

Global Banking
 
 
 
net income fell to $40 million. Strong deposit growth and the impact of the Merrill Lynch acquisition were more than offset by higher credit and FDIC insurance costs.
Global Banking
The provision for credit losses increased to $2.3 billion as net charge-offs continued to rise within the commercial real estate and domestic portfolios. Also contributing were reserve additions in the commercial real estate portfolio. These increases reflect deterioration across a broad range of industries and property types.
 
 
Note: Total investment banking income in the quarter of $1.3 billion was shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets based on an internal fee-sharing arrangement among the two segments. Debt and equity issuance fees primarily led to an increase from the year-ago quarter while advisory fees increased 71 percent, reflecting the larger investment banking platform from the Merrill Lynch acquisition.

net income increased $2.8 billion driven by the addition of Merrill Lynch and a more favorable trading environment. Revenue was strong in the period, partially offset by $714 million in credit valuation adjustments on derivative liabilities. Market disruption charges had a reduced impact compared with the prior year. Noninterest expense increased due to the Merrill Lynch acquisition.

net income rose to $271 million driven by the addition of Merrill Lynch and a decline in support for certain cash funds. This was partially offset by higher credit costs, lower net interest income partly due to the transfer of certain client balances to the Deposits and the Home Loans and Insurance segments.
Global Wealth and Investment Management
Net revenue increased to $4.1 billion as investment and brokerage service income rose due to the addition of Merrill Lynch and the level of support for certain cash funds declined.
The provision for credit losses increased to $515 million primarily driven by a single large commercial charge-off and reserve increases in the consumer real estate and commercial portfolios reflecting the weak economy.

All Other
 
(Dollars in millions)
 
 
 
The net loss in widened to $1.6 billion. Increased gains on the sale of debt securities and higher equity investment income were offset by mark-to-market adjustments related to certain Merrill Lynch structured notes and other-than-temporary impairment charges related to non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations. Excluding the securitization impact to show Global Card Services on a managed basis, the provision for credit losses increased compared with the same period last year due to higher losses in the residential mortgage portfolio and reserve additions on the Countrywide purchased impaired portfolio. Noninterest expense increased due to merger and restructuring charges related to the Merrill Lynch acquisition and a pretax charge to pay the U.S. government to terminate its asset guarantee term sheet.
All Other
All Other consists primarily of equity investments, the residential mortgage portfolio associated with asset and liability management (ALM) activities, the residual impact of the cost allocation process, merger and restructuring charges, intersegment eliminations, fair-value adjustments related to certain Merrill Lynch structured notes and the results of certain consumer finance, investment management and commercial lending businesses that are being liquidated. All Other also includes the offsetting securitization impact to present Global Card Services on a managed basis. For more information and detailed reconciliation, please refer to the data pages supplied with this press release. Effective January 1, 2009, All Other includes the results of First Republic Bank, which was acquired as part of the Merrill Lynch acquisition.

Reconciliation to GAAP financial measures
The Corporation evaluates its business utilizing non-GAAP ratios including the tangible common equity ratio. The tangible common equity ratio represents common shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. This measure is used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity (i.e., capital). We believe the use of this non-GAAP measure provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation.
Other companies may define or calculate the tangible common equity ratio and the tangible book value per share of common stock differently. See the tables below for corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures at September 30, 2009, June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008.

The Corporation reports on a managed basis. Reporting on a managed basis is consistent with the way that management evaluates the results of Managed basis assumes that securitized loans were not sold and presents earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold (i.e., held loans) are presented. Loan securitization is an alternative funding process that is used by the Corporation to diversify funding sources. Loan securitization removes loans from the Consolidated Balance Sheet through the sale of loans to an off-balance sheet qualified special purpose entity which is excluded from the Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).

The performance of the managed portfolio is important in understanding results as it demonstrates the results of the entire portfolio serviced by the business. Securitized loans continue to be serviced by the business and are subject to the same underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring as held loans. In addition, retained excess servicing income is exposed to similar credit risk and repricing of interest rates as held loans. managed income statement line items differ from a held basis reported as follows:

The Corporation reports results on a managed basis which is consistent with the way that management evaluates the results of . Managed basis assumes that securitized loans were not sold and presents earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold (i.e., held loans) are presented. Loan securitization is an alternative funding process that is used by the Corporation to diversify funding sources. Loan securitization removes loans from the Consolidated Balance Sheet through the sale of loans to an off-balance sheet qualified special purpose entity which is excluded from the Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).
Global Card Services'
Global Card Services
The performance of the managed portfolio is important in understanding ' results as it demonstrates the results of the entire portfolio serviced by the business. Securitized loans continue to be serviced by the business and are subject to the same underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring as held loans. In addition, excess servicing income is exposed to similar credit risk and repricing of interest rates as held loans. ' managed income statement line items differ from a held basis reported as follows:

- Most significant remaining losses against existing reserves expected to be realized over the next few quarters
- Continued refinement of loss estimates reflects increased frequency and severity performance versus expectations
- Loss estimates were offset by improvements in the home price forecast and benefits from modification efforts
o Remaining mark and allowance of $4.6 billion coupled with the charge-offs reflect a 29% reduction on the unpaid principal balance (UPB)
o Loans with $33 billion of UPB in the impaired portfolio have experienced no charge-offs and over $27 billion of this amount is current
- Of the roughly $6 billion loans that are noncurrent, but have had no charge-offs, approximately one third are early stage delinquent
o The loans that have experienced charge-offs are carried at net realizable value of approximately $6 billion
