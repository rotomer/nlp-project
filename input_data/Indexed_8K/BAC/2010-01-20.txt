CHARLOTTE  Bank of America Corporation today reported full-year 2009 net income of $6.3 billion, compared with net income of $4.0 billion in 2008. Including preferred stock dividends and the negative impact from the repayment of the U.S. government's $45 billion preferred stock investment in the company under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), income applicable to common shareholders was a net loss of $2.2 billion, or $0.29 per diluted share.
Those results compared with 2008 net income applicable to common shareholders of $2.6 billion, or $0.54 per diluted share.
In the fourth quarter of 2009, the company's net loss narrowed to $194 million from a loss of $1.8 billion a year earlier. Including dividends on preferred stock and the one-time $4.0 billion negative impact associated with repaying TARP, income applicable to common shareholders in the period was a net loss of $5.2 billion, or $0.60 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $2.4 billion, or $0.48 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter.
Results in the fourth quarter reflected continued elevated credit costs, although lower than in the third quarter of 2009. While net interest income declined from the year-ago quarter as a result of lower asset liability management portfolio levels and reduced loan demand, noninterest income was up sharply due to an improvement in trading and significantly higher income from investment and brokerage services, equity investments and investment banking.

"While it's disappointing to report a loss for the fourth quarter, there were a number of important accomplishments worth noting," said Chief Executive Officer and President Brian T. Moynihan. "First, we repaid the American taxpayer, with interest, for the TARP investment. Second, we have taken steps to strengthen our balance sheet through successful securities offerings. And third, all of our non-credit businesses recorded positive contributions to our results.
"As we look at 2010, we are encouraged by signs the economy is improving, as we have seen in the stabilization of our credit costs, particularly in the consumer businesses. That said, economic conditions remain fragile and we expect high unemployment levels to continue, creating an ongoing drag on consumer spending and growth."

Fourth-Quarter 2009 Financial Summary
Revenue and Expense
Revenue net of interest expense on a fully taxable-equivalent basis rose 59 percent to $25.4 billion from $16.0 billion a year ago, reflecting in part the addition of Merrill Lynch.
 
More
Page 4
 
Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis declined 11 percent to $11.9 billion, compared with $13.4 billion a year earlier. The decrease was a result of lower asset liability management portfolio levels, reduced loan levels and the unfavorable impact of higher nonperforming loans. This was partially offset by the addition of Merrill Lynch. The net interest yield narrowed 69 basis points to 2.62 percent.
Noninterest income rose to $13.5 billion from $2.6 billion a year earlier. Higher trading account profits, investment and brokerage services fees and investment banking income reflected the addition of Merrill Lynch and significantly lower market disruption losses. The current quarter also included a $1.1 billion gain on the company's investment in BlackRock as a result of its purchase of Barclay's asset management business. These increases were partially offset by $1.6 billion in losses mostly related to mark-to-market adjustments on the Merrill Lynch structured notes, as the company's credit spreads improved during the quarter. Card income declined $1.3 billion mainly due to higher credit losses on securitized credit card loans and lower fee income.
Noninterest expense increased to $16.4 billion from $10.9 billion a year earlier. Personnel costs and other general operating expenses rose, driven in part by the Merrill Lynch acquisition. Pretax merger and restructuring charges rose to $533 million from $306 million a year earlier.
The efficiency ratio on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was 64.47 percent, compared with 68.51 percent a year earlier.
Pretax, pre-provision income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was $9.0 billion compared with $5.0 billion a year earlier. The company had a tax benefit of $1.2 billion in the quarter compared with a benefit of $2.0 billion the same period last year.
Credit Quality
Credit quality showed signs of improvement in most portfolios compared with the prior quarter, although credit costs remained high as global economic conditions remained challenging. Rising unemployment and underemployment kept consumers under stress and individuals spent longer periods without work. Losses, however, declined in most consumer portfolios from the prior quarter.
The impact of the weak economy on the commercial portfolios moderated somewhat with criticized loans decreasing and the growth of nonperforming loans slowing. Losses in the homebuilder portfolio dropped from the prior quarter and losses in the commercial domestic portfolio declined across a broad range of borrowers and industries.

Net charge-offs were $1.2 billion lower than the prior quarter, driven by improvements across most consumer portfolios. Net charge-offs declined from the previous quarter for the first time in nearly four years. Nonperforming assets were $35.7 billion, compared with $33.8 billion at September 30, 2009, reflecting a slower rate of increase than in recent quarters.
The provision for credit losses was $10.1 billion, $1.6 billion lower than the third quarter and $1.6 billion higher than the same period a year earlier. The $1.7 billion addition to the reserve for credit losses was lower than the third quarter, driven by lower additions on the purchased impaired consumer portfolios obtained through acquisitions and improved delinquencies in certain consumer and small business portfolios. These decreases were partially offset by additions to increase reserve coverage on the consumer credit card portfolio. The 2008 coverage ratios and amounts shown in the following table do not include Merrill Lynch, which was acquired on January 1, 2009.

Capital Management
 
 
 
 
Capital ratios were impacted from the prior quarter primarily due to the issuance of equity and repayment of TARP
.
During the quarter, a cash dividend of $0.01 per common share was paid and the company reported $5.0 billion in preferred dividends. Period-end common shares issued and outstanding were 8.65 billion for the fourth and third quarters of 2009 and 5.02 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008.
During the fourth quarter, Bank of America sold 1.286 billion common equivalent securities, generating gross proceeds of $19.3 billion. The offering was priced at $15.00 per depository share and its proceeds, along with existing corporate funds, were used to repurchase all the preferred stock issued to the U.S. Department of the Treasury to repay the TARP investment.
Full-Year 2009 Financial Summary
Revenue and Expense
Revenue net of interest expense on a fully taxable-equivalent basis rose 63 percent to $120.9 billion from $74.0 billion a year ago, reflecting in part the addition of Countrywide and Merrill Lynch.
Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was $48.4 billion, compared with $46.6 billion for 2008. The increase was a result of increased deposit levels, a favorable rate environment, the acquisitions of Merrill Lynch and Countrywide, offset in part by asset liability management portfolio levels, lower consumer loan balances and an increase in nonperforming loans. The net interest yield narrowed 33 basis points to 2.65 percent.

Noninterest income rose to $72.5 billion from $27.4 billion a year earlier. Higher trading account profits, equity investment income, investment and brokerage services fees and investment banking income reflected the addition of Merrill Lynch and significantly lower market disruption losses. These increases, as well as the increase in mortgage banking income related to the Countrywide acquisition and gains on the sale of debt securities, were partially offset by $4.9 billion in net losses mostly related to mark-to-market adjustments on the Merrill Lynch structured notes, as the company's credit spreads improved, and approximately $800 million in net credit valuation adjustments on derivative liabilities. Card income declined $5.0 billion mainly from higher credit losses on securitized credit card loans and lower fee income.
Noninterest expense increased to $66.7 billion from $41.5 billion a year earlier. Personnel costs and other general operating expenses rose due to the full-year impact of Countrywide and the addition of Merrill Lynch. Pretax merger and restructuring charges rose to $2.7 billion from $935 million a year earlier.
The efficiency ratio on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was 55.16 percent compared with 56.14 percent a year earlier.
Pretax, pre-provision income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was $54.2 billion compared with $32.4 billion a year earlier. For the year, the company recognized a tax benefit of $1.9 billion, compared with a tax expense of $420 million in 2008. The decrease in tax expense was due to certain tax benefits, as well as a shift in the geographic mix of the company's earnings driven by the addition of Merrill Lynch.
Credit Quality
Weakness in global economies drove higher credit costs in 2009. The provision for credit losses was $48.6 billion, $21.7 billion higher than 2008, reflecting higher net charge-offs and additions to reserves. Higher reserve additions resulted from further deterioration on the purchased impaired consumer portfolios obtained through acquisitions, broad-based deterioration in the core commercial portfolio and the impact of deterioration in the housing markets on the residential mortgage portfolio.
Net charge-offs were $17.5 billion higher than the prior year across all portfolios. Nonperforming assets were $35.7 billion, compared with $18.2 billion at December 31, 2008. The 2008 ratios and amounts shown in the following table do not include Merrill Lynch, which was acquired on January 1, 2009.

Capital Management
Bank of America increased its Tier 1 common capital by $57 billion through multiple capital actions taken during 2009 that included issuing shares of common stock, issuing common equivalent securities, exchanging certain non-government preferred stock for common stock and asset sales.
Tangible common equity benefited from the positive impact of market movement on available-for-sale securities.
During the year, cash dividends of $0.04 per common share were paid and the company reported $8.5 billion in preferred dividends including the cost associated with TARP repayment.

2009 Business Segment Results
Deposits
 
(Dollars in millions)
 
 
 
net income fell 55 percent from a year ago as revenue declined and noninterest expense rose. Revenue declined mainly due to lower residual net interest income impacted by the corporation's asset liability management activities and spread compression as interest rates declined. Noninterest expense increased as a result of higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) insurance and special assessment costs.
Deposits
Average customer deposits rose 14 percent, or $49.2 billion, from a year ago due to strong organic growth and the transfer of certain client deposits from Global Wealth and Investment Management. Organic growth was driven by the continuing need of customers to manage their liquidity as illustrated by growth in higher spread deposits from new money, as well as movement from certificates of deposit to other products. The increase was partially offset by the expected decline in higher-yielding Countrywide deposits.
Fourth-quarter net income fell 62 percent to $595 million compared with the same period last year due to a decline in revenue and an increase in noninterest expense. These period-over-period changes were driven by the same factors as described in the full year discussion above. The decline in revenue included the impact of implementing new initiatives aimed at assisting customers who are economically stressed by reducing the amount of their banking fees. Overdraft fees declined $160 million as a result of these initiatives.

Global Card Services
 
(Dollars in millions)
 
 
 
reported a net loss of $5.6 billion as credit costs continued to rise, reflecting weak economies in the U.S., Europe and Canada. Managed net revenue declined 6 percent to $29.3 billion mainly due to lower fee income and the absence of one-time gains that positively impacted 2008 results. The decline was partially offset by higher net interest income, as lower funding costs outpaced the decline in average managed loans. The revenue decline also was partially driven by enrolling customers who are experiencing financial stress in various card modification programs.
Global Card Services
Provision expense increased to $30.1 billion from a year earlier as economic conditions led to higher losses in the consumer card and consumer lending portfolios, including a higher level of bankruptcies. Reserve additions related to maturing securitizations and increased coverage on the consumer credit card portfolio also contributed to the increase. These increases were partially offset by reserve reductions in consumer lending and lower reserve additions for the small business portfolio resulting from improved delinquencies.
Noninterest expense declined 13 percent on lower operating and marketing costs.

The fourth-quarter net loss of $1.0 billion was due to higher credit costs and lower managed revenues driven by the impact of the weak economyNet revenue fell 11 percent compared with a year ago as net interest and fee income declined, partially offset by lower operating and marketing costs. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, the company helped more than 200,000 customers by reducing their rates and providing them more affordable payment terms.
.
Home Loans and Insurance
 
(Dollars in millions)
 
 
 
n/m = not meaningful
The net loss in widened to $3.8 billion as higher credit costs continued to negatively impact results. Net revenue increased 82 percent primarily driven by the full-year benefit of Countrywide and higher loan production income from increased refinance activity.
Home Loans and Insurance
The provision for credit losses rose to $11.2 billion, driven by continued economic weakness and lower home prices. Reserves were increased mainly due to further deterioration in the purchased impaired portfolio.
Noninterest expense rose to $11.7 billion mostly due to the full-year impact of Countrywide as well as increased compensation costs and other expenses related to higher production volume and higher delinquencies. Part of the increase in expenses was a result of more than doubling the staff and other costs in the home retention group.

Page 12
 
The fourth-quarter net loss increased 40 percent to $993 million compared with the year-ago quarter. Net revenue rose mostly on higher income from loan production. The increase was partially offset by lower servicing revenue driven by unfavorable mortgage servicing rights results. Higher production volume and delinquencies led to increased expenses. Provision for credit losses increased due to the same factors as described in the full-year discussion above.
Global Banking

net income declined to $3.0 billion. Strong deposit growth and the impact of the Merrill Lynch acquisition were more than offset by increased credit costs and higher FDIC insurance and special assessment costs.
Global Banking
The provision for credit losses rose to $8.8 billion driven by higher net charge-offs and additions to reserves in the commercial real estate and commercial domestic portfolios. These increases reflect deterioration across a broad range of industries, property types and borrowers.

Fourth-quarter net income declined 74 percent to $264 million compared with a year earlier due to higher credit, FDIC insurance and compensation costs. Provision for credit losses rose due to higher net charge-offs and reserve additions within the commercial real estate portfolio. Net revenue increased due to the impact of the Merrill Lynch acquisition.
Note: 2009 investment banking income of $5.6 billion was shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets based on an internal fee-sharing arrangement between the two segments. This represents a more than twofold increase from a year earlier, reflecting the company's larger investment banking platform.
Global Markets
 
(Dollars in millions)

net income increased $12.1 billion driven by the addition of Merrill Lynch and a more favorable trading environment. Revenue increased to $20.6 billion due to improved market conditions and the reduced impact of market disruption charges compared with the prior year. Noninterest expense increased due to the Merrill Lynch acquisition. The increase was partially offset by a change in compensation that delivers a greater portion of incentive pay over time.

reported net income of $478 million. Higher equity investment income and increased gains on the sale of debt securities were offset by $4.9 billion mark-to-market losses mainly related to certain Merrill Lynch structured notes as credit spreads improved. Results were also impacted by other-than-temporary impairment charges related to non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations. Excluding the securitization impact to show Global Card Services on a managed basis, the provision for credit losses increased compared with the same period last year due to higher losses in the residential mortgage portfolio. Noninterest expense increased due to merger and restructuring charges related to the Merrill Lynch acquisition and a pretax charge to pay the U.S. government to terminate its asset guarantee term sheet.
All Other
All Other consists primarily of equity investments, the residential mortgage portfolio associated with asset and liability management (ALM) activities, the residual impact of the cost allocation process, merger and restructuring charges, intersegment eliminations, fair-value adjustments related to certain Merrill Lynch structured notes and the results of certain consumer finance, investment management and commercial lending businesses that are being liquidated. All Other also includes the offsetting securitization impact to present Global Card Services on a managed basis. For more information and detailed reconciliation, please refer to the data pages supplied with this press release. Effective January 1, 2009, All Other includes the results of First Republic Bank, which was acquired as part of the Merrill Lynch acquisition.

Reconciliation to GAAP financial measures
The Corporation evaluates its business based upon ratios that utilize tangible equity which is a non-GAAP measure. The tangible equity ratio represents shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible common equity ratio represents common shareholders' equity plus Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per share of common stock represents ending common shareholders' equity plus Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by ending common shares outstanding plus the number of common shares issued upon conversion of Common Equivalent Securities. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity (i.e., capital). We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation.
Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. See the tables below for corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures at December 31, 2009, September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008.

The Corporation reports results on a managed basis which is consistent with the way that management evaluates the results of Managed basis assumes that securitized loans were not sold and presents earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold (i.e., held loans) are presented. Loan securitization is an alternative funding process that is used by the Corporation to diversify funding sources. Loan securitization removes loans from the Consolidated Balance Sheet through the sale of loans to an off-balance sheet qualified special purpose entity which is excluded from the Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).

Securitized loans continue to be serviced by the business and are subject to the same underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring as held loans. In addition, retained excess servicing income is exposed to similar credit risk and repricing of interest rates as held loans. managed income statement line items differ from a held basis reported as follows:

Loan securitization is an alternative funding process that is used by the Corporation to diversify funding sources. Loan securitization removes loans from the Consolidated Balance Sheet through the sale of loans to an off-balance sheet qualified special purpose entity which is excluded from the Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).

Recurring charge-offs peaked and are trending down
$487 million in remaining purchase accounting marks and the additional reserves of $3.9 billion leaves a total of $4.4 billion for purchased impaired loans from the Countrywide acquisition
Loss estimates increased due to further deterioration as well as reassessing modification benefits to reflect experience partially offset by improvements in the home price forecast
Remaining mark and allowance of $4.4 billion coupled with the charge-offs reflect a 30% reduction on the original unpaid principal balance (UPB)
Loans with $31 billion of UPB in the purchased impaired portfolio have experienced no charge-offs and over $25 billion of this amount is current
Of the roughly $6 billion loans that are noncurrent, but have had no charge-offs, approximately one third are early stage delinquent
The loans that have experienced charge-offs are carried at net realizable value of approximately $7 billion
Charge-offs shown do not flow through GAAP charge-offs as they were considered as part of the original purchase accounting and are broken out by original product classifications even if loans were modified into another product type
The original credit mark taken on the acquired Countrywide purchased impaired loans was $11.9 billion and has been reduced by charge-offs and TDRs removed from the impaired portfolio
Additional allowance was established through provision expense in 4Q08 of $750 million, 1Q09 of $853 million, 2Q09 $621 million , $1.3 billion in 3Q09 and $537 million in 4Q09

Adjusting for the $110 million impact for refinements in valuation processes reported 4Q09 residential mortgage loss rate would have been 1.88%. Adjusting for the $152 million impact of revising our estimate of the impact the REO process has on net realizable value, the 3Q09 reported loss rate in residential mortgage would have been 1.80%. Adjusting for the acceleration of $223 million due to an adjustment for the protracted nature of collections under some insurance contracts, reported 3Q09 home equity losses would been 4.52%

Capital Results
Tier 1 capital declined as a result of $45 billion TARP repayment, partially offset by issuance of $19 billion of common equivalent securities
Tier 1 common increased $8 billion from issuance of $19 billion of common equivalent securities offset by net loss after preferred dividends and higher disallowed deferred tax assets primarily as a result of TARP repayment
lowering regulatory capital
Tier 1 capital ratio equals Tier 1 capital including common equivalent securities divided by risk-weighted assets.
Tier 1 common equity ratio equals Tier 1 capital including common equivalent securities excluding preferred stock, trust preferred securities, hybrid securities and minority interest divided by risk-weighted assets.
Tangible common equity ratio equals common shareholders' equity including common equivalent securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage service rights) net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities.
 
Impact of Adopting SFAS 166 and 167
SFAS 166 and 167 are effective January 1, 2010
Net incremental balance sheet impact expected to be approximately $100 billion
Includes securitized credit card and home equity receivables returning to the balance sheet with
net incremental impact of $72 billion
 Regulatory capital will be reduced by approximately $10 billion, including DTA limitation,
as reserves are established for those securitized receivables
