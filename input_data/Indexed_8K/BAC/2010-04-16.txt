CHARLOTTE  Bank of America Corporation today reported first-quarter 2010 net income of $3.2 billion compared with a net loss of $194 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and net income of $4.2 billion a year earlier. After preferred dividends, the company earned $0.28 per diluted share in the first quarter up from a loss of $0.60 per share in the fourth quarter and earnings of $0.44 per share in the first quarter of 2009.
Two factors primarily drove results in the first quarter:
 
 
"With each day that passes, the 2010 story appears to be one of continuing credit recovery and our results reflect a gradually improving economy," said Chief Executive Officer and President Brian T. Moynihan. "Our customers  individuals, companies, and institutional investors  increasingly see the value of our integrated capabilities. We also are seeing ample indications that those integrated capabilities hold promise for long-term shareholder value."

"We will continue to support our customers through these and other initiatives aimed at helping restore their financial health," Moynihan said. "We want to ensure quality relationships with our customers and earn their trust and future business. This will benefit not just our customers, but our company and our shareholders."
First-Quarter 2010 Financial Summary
Revenue and Expense
Revenue net of interest expense on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE)
1
basis declined 11 percent to $32.3 billion from $36.1 billion a year ago. Revenue declines were driven by the absence of year-earlier credit-related gains on Merrill Lynch structured notes, the sale of an equity investment and lower mortgage banking volume and income.
Revenue was up 27 percent from the fourth quarter of 2009.
Net interest income on an FTE basis was $14.1 billion compared with $12.8 billion a year earlier. On a managed FTE basis, net interest income declined from $15.6 billion a year earlier as loan demand decreased and charge-offs reduced loan balances. The increase in reported net interest income was primarily due to the adoption of new consolidation accounting guidance effective Jan. 1, which moved net assets of approximately $100 billion onto the balance sheet. The change, while having no material impact on net income, primarily affected net interest income, card income and the provision for loan and lease losses. The net interest yield widened 23 basis points to 2.93 percent, but average loans declined by 2 percent reflecting economic conditions and lower demand.

Noninterest income declined 22 percent to $18.2 billion from $23.3 billion a year ago. Lower mortgage banking income and decreases in both card income and equity investment income drove the decline. Mortgage banking income declined, driven by less favorable mortgage servicing rights hedging results and lower production volume and margins. Card income declined due to the recent adoption of new accounting guidance and the CARD Act, while equity investment income was impacted by the absence of the gain a year earlier on the sale of China Construction Bank (CCB) shares. However, noninterest income was up 35 percent from the fourth quarter of 2009, reflecting record sales and trading revenue in the current quarter.
Noninterest expense increased 5 percent to $17.8 billion from $17.0 billion a year earlier as personnel costs and other general operating expenses rose. Pretax merger and restructuring charges declined to $521 million from $765 million a year earlier.
The efficiency ratio on an FTE basis was 55.05 percent, compared with 47.12 percent a year earlier.
 
Credit Quality
 
(Dollars in millions)
 
 
 
Note: Ratios do not include loans measured under the fair value option.
Credit quality continued to improve during the quarter, with net losses declining in most consumer portfolios. Credit costs, however, remain high amid relatively weak global economic conditions.
Credit quality across most commercial portfolios showed signs of improvement with criticized and nonperforming loans decreasing from the prior quarter. Net charge-offs in the commercial portfolios declined across a broad range of borrowers and industries.
Net charge-offs were $2.4 billion higher than the fourth quarter of 2009, driven mainly by the adoption of new accounting guidance that resulted in securitized credit card loans and other loans coming back onto the company's balance sheet. Also contributing to the increase were charge-offs on certain modified collateral-dependent consumer real estate loans. Excluding these factors, net charge-offs would have been $1.3 billion lower. Net charge-offs in the first quarter of $10.8 billion, or 4.44 percent, which reflect the new accounting guidance, are comparable with managed net losses of $11.3 billion, or 4.54 percent, in the prior quarter. Nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were $35.9 billion, compared with $35.7 billion at December 31, 2009.

The provision for credit losses was $9.8 billion, $305 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2009 and $3.6 billion lower than the same period a year earlier. Excluding the $10.8 billion increase to the reserve for credit losses associated with adopting the new accounting guidance, which did not initially impact provision, reserves were reduced $992 million during the quarter. This compares with a $1.7 billion addition to the reserve for credit losses in the fourth quarter and $6.4 billion a year earlier. The reduction from the fourth quarter of 2009 was primarily due to improved delinquencies and lower bankruptcies in consumer and small business products in Global Card Services and the stabilization of commercial portfolios. These were partially offset by higher reserve additions in the consumer real estate portfolios amid continued stress in the housing market, including reserve additions for purchased credit-impaired consumer portfolios obtained through acquisitions.

Capital and Liquidity Management
 
 
 
 
Capital ratios were negatively impacted from the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to the adoption of new accounting guidance on consolidation. The company's liquidity position strengthened during the quarter as customers continued to reduce debt. Cash and equivalents rose more than $20 billion. The company's total global excess liquidity sources rose by approximately $50 billion to more than $260 billion. The company's time to required funding stands at 24 months.
During the quarter, a cash dividend of $0.01 per common share was paid and the company reported $348 million in preferred dividends. Period-end common shares issued and outstanding were 10.03 billion for the first quarter of 2010, 8.65 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009 and 6.40 billion for the first quarter of 2009. The increase in outstanding shares was driven primarily by the conversion of common equivalent shares into common stock in the first quarter of 2010.

2010 Business Segment Results
Deposits
 
(Dollars in millions)
 
 
 
net income rose 14 percent as the 8 percent increase in revenue was partially offset by increased noninterest expense. Revenue increased mainly due to growth in deposits as well as improved spreads. Noninterest income remained relatively flat. Expenses rose as a higher percentage of the retail distribution costs shifted to Deposits from the other consumer businesses.
Deposits
Average deposits rose 10 percent, or $37.9 billion, from a year ago due to the transfer of $39.7 billion in certain client deposits from Global Wealth and Investment Management and $15.2 billion of organic growth. Organic growth was driven by the continuing need of customers to manage their liquidity as illustrated by growth in higher spread deposits. The increase was partially offset by the expected decline in higher-yielding Countrywide deposits.

Global Card Services
 
(Dollars in millions)
 
 
 
reported net income of $952 million as credit costs declined, reflecting continued improvement in the U.S. economy. Net revenue declined 9 percent to $6.8 billion due to lower net interest income from the decline in average loans and lower fee income resulting from the implementation of the CARD Act.
Global Card Services
Provision for credit losses decreased $4.7 billion to $3.5 billion from a year ago as lower delinquencies and lower expected losses from the improved economic outlook drove reserve reductions during the quarter.
Expenses decreased as a higher percentage of the retail distribution costs shifted to Deposits from Global Card Services.

Home Loans and Insurance
 
(Dollars in millions)
 
 
 
The net loss in widened to $2.1 billion as higher credit costs continued to negatively impact results. Net revenue decreased 31 percent due to lower mortgage banking income, driven by less favorable mortgage servicing rights results and lower production volume and margins resulting from a decrease in refinance activity.
Home Loans and Insurance
The provision for credit losses rose to $3.6 billion, driven by higher reserve additions amid continued stress in the housing market. Also driving the increase was the impact of certain modified loans where carrying value is based on the underlying collateral value and higher home equity net charge-offs related to loans that were consolidated in the quarter as a result of new accounting guidance. These increases were partially offset by lower reserve additions on the Countrywide home equity purchased credit-impaired portfolio, compared with the year-ago period.
Noninterest expense rose to $3.3 billion mostly due to expenses related to increased litigation costs, default management staff, vendor expenses and loss mitigation efforts.

Effective January 1, 2010, Bank of America realigned the Global Banking and Global Markets business segments. The segments are now referred to as Global Commercial Banking and Global Banking and Markets. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
Global Commercial Banking
 
(Dollars in millions)
 
 
 
n/m = not meaningful
returned to profitability, recording net income of $713 million, driven by lower credit costs and increased revenues.
Global Commercial Banking
Net revenue rose as improved loan spreads on new, renewed and amended facilities drove an increase in net interest income. The increase was partially offset by reduced loan balances. Net revenue also benefited from strong deposit growth, as clients remain very liquid, partially offset by narrower spreads on deposits and lower treasury services transaction volumes that reflect current economic conditions.
The provision for credit losses decreased to $916 million on lower credit costs in the retail dealer-related portfolio and stabilization across most commercial portfolios.
Average loan balances decreased $23.7 billion as loan demand remained weak. Average deposit balances continued to grow, increasing $24.9 billion as clients sought to increase liquidity.
Note: Global Commercial Banking clients include middle-market and business banking companies, commercial real estate firms and governments and are generally defined as companies with sales up to $2 billion. Lending products and services include commercial loans and commitment facilities, real estate lending, asset-based lending and indirect consumer loans. Treasury solutions include treasury management, foreign exchange and short-term investing options.

Global Banking and Markets
 
(Dollars in millions)
 
 
 
net income increased $709 million to $3.2 billion, driven by record performance in sales and trading. Revenue increased by $795 million as market conditions improved and the impact of writedowns on legacy assets decreased from a year earlier. Noninterest expense declined $338 million due to merger efficiencies and the shift in compensation that delivers a greater portion of incentive pay over time.
Global Banking and Markets
Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities revenue of $5.8 billion was primarily driven by sales and trading revenues. Revenue rose on improved market conditions, increased liquidity, tighter credit spreads and the reduced impact of writedowns on legacy assets.
Equities revenue rose to $1.7 billion primarily driven by sales and trading revenues of $1.5 billion. Higher revenue was driven by effective market positioning and related equity derivative trading gains.
Corporate and Investment Banking revenue of $2.3 billion included corporate banking revenue of $1.6 billion. Corporate banking revenue was flat year over year, as higher credit related revenue was offset by lower treasury services revenue. Investment banking revenue, which rose 18 percent to $1.2 billion, was shared between the subsegments of Global Banking and Markets. The increase reflected the strength of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch platform and was driven by debt and equity issuances.
Note: Global Banking and Markets includes the results of the Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities, Equities, and Corporate and Investment Banking businesses and the core banking products to large corporate clients that are defined as having sales in excess of $2 billion, as well as the results related to the Merchant Services joint venture.

Global Wealth and Investment Management
 
(Dollars in millions)
 
 
 
net income rose to $497 million, driven mainly by higher investment and brokerage activity. Net revenue increased to $4.4 billion on the absence of support for certain cash funds and higher investment and brokerage service income, partially offset by lower net interest income.
Global Wealth and Investment Management
Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management net revenue declined $202 million to $3.1 billion from a year earlier, mainly due to the impact of the migration of certain deposits and loan balances to the Deposits and Home Loans and Insurance businesses and lower residual net interest income. These impacts to net interest income were partially offset by improvements in investment and brokerage income due to higher valuations in the equity markets and increased transactional activity.
U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management net revenue of $688 million was flat as higher valuations in the equity markets and increased deposit spreads were offset by net outflows and lower residual net interest income.
Columbia Management net revenue increased $127 million to $277 million, driven by the absence of support provided to certain cash funds and the impact of higher valuations in the equity markets. These were partially offset by a reduction in revenues, driven by net outflows in the cash complex.
Global Wealth and Investment Management also includes the results related to the Retirement and Philanthropic Services business and the economic ownership interest related to the company's investment in BlackRock, Inc.

All Other
reported a net loss of $810 million due to lower net revenue, which was further impacted by increases in provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. Effective January 1, 2010, due to the recent adoption of new consolidation accounting guidance, the securitization offsets for net interest income, card income and the provision for credit losses are no longer recorded as part of All Other. Results were also impacted by other-than-temporary impairment charges primarily related to non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations. Provision for credit losses was driven by the impact of new accounting guidance and higher credit costs in the discontinued real estate purchased credit-impaired portfolio, partially offset by lower reserve builds related to the residential mortgage portfolio. Noninterest expense increased due to higher personnel, general operating and other expenses.
All Other
All Other consists primarily of equity investments, the residential mortgage portfolio associated with asset and liability management (ALM) activities, the residual impact of the cost allocation process, merger and restructuring charges, intersegment eliminations, fair value adjustments related to certain Merrill Lynch structured notes and the results of certain consumer finance, investment management and commercial lending businesses that are being liquidated. In prior periods, All Other also included the offsetting securitization impact to present Global Card Services on a managed basis. For more information and detailed reconciliation, please refer to the data pages supplied with this press release. In addition, All Other includes the results of First Republic Bank, which was acquired as part of the Merrill Lynch acquisition.

Reconciliation to GAAP Financial Measures
 
(Dollars in millions, shares in thousands)
The Corporation evaluates its business based upon a FTE basis which is a non-GAAP measure. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on a FTE basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to a FTE basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The Corporation also evaluates its business based upon ratios that utilize tangible equity which is a non-GAAP measure. The tangible equity ratio represents shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible common equity ratio represents common shareholders' equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per share of common stock represents ending common shareholders' equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related ending common shareholders' equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by ending common shares outstanding plus the number of common shares issued upon conversion of common equivalent shares. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity (i.e., capital). We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation.
Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. See the tables below for corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures at March 31, 2010, December 31, 2009 and March 31, 2009. We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation.

Reconciliation - Managed to GAAP
 
(Dollars in millions)
The Corporation reports current period results in accordance with new accounting guidance on consolidation of VIEs and transfers of financial assets. Prior period results are presented on a managed basis. Managed basis assumes that securitized loans were not sold and presents earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold (i.e., held loans) are presented. Loan securitization is an alternative funding process that is used by the Corporation to diversify funding sources. In prior periods, loan securitization removed loans from the Consolidated Balance Sheet through the sale of loans to an off-balance sheet qualifying special purpose entity which was excluded from the Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP applicable at the time.
Global Card Services
The performance of the managed portfolio is important in understanding results as it demonstrates the results of the entire portfolio serviced by the business. Securitized loans continue to be serviced by the business and are subject to the same underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring as held loans. In addition, excess servicing income is exposed to similar credit risk and repricing of interest rates as held loans. In prior periods, managed income statement line items differed from a held basis reported as follows:

Seasonality of 4Q09 holiday spending Increased balances from tax refunds Less business days in the quarter

Exhibit A: Non-GAAP Reconciliations
Bank of America Corporation and Subsidiaries
Reconciliation to GAAP Financial Measures
 
(Dollars in millions, shares in thousands)
The Corporation evaluates its business based upon a fully taxable-equivalent basis which is a non-GAAP measure. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to a fully taxable-equivalent basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The Corporation also evaluates its business based upon ratios that utilize tangible equity which is a non-GAAP measure. Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of common shareholders' equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of average shareholders' equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible common equity ratio represents common shareholders' equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible equity ratio represents total shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents ending common shareholders' equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by ending common shares outstanding plus any common shares issued upon assumed conversion of common equivalent shares. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity (i.e., capital). In addition, profitability, relationship, and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders' equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. Also, the efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue. We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation.
Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. See the tables below for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the three months ended March 31, 2010, December 31, 2009, September 30, 2009, June 30, 2009 and March 31, 2009.

The Corporation reports current period results in accordance with new accounting guidance on consolidation of VIEs and transfers of financial assets. Prior period results are presented on a managed basis. Managed basis assumes that securitized loans were not sold and presents earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold (i.e., held loans) are presented. Loan securitization is an alternative funding process that is used by the Corporation to diversify funding sources. In prior periods, loan securitization removed loans from the Consolidated Balance Sheet through the sale of loans to an off-balance sheet qualifying special purpose entity which was excluded from the Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP applicable at the time.
Global Card Services
The performance of the managed portfolio is important in understanding results as it demonstrates the results of the entire portfolio serviced by the business. Securitized loans continue to be serviced by the business and are subject to the same underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring as held loans. In addition, excess servicing income is exposed to similar credit risk and repricing of interest rates as held loans. In prior periods, managed income statement line items differed from a held basis reported as follows:

Comments vs 4Q09
Average loans, including impact of net charge-offs, declined $13 B compared to 4Q09 on a managed basis Consumer declines were led by average card receivables falling $7 B
Commercial loans declined $8 B
 Excluding impact of FAS 166/167 adoption commercial loans fell $13 B
 Clients at the smaller revenue end of the Commercial portfolio have started to exhibit early signs of demand improvement based on preliminary application trends the past two months
Comments vs. 4Q09
Average retail deposits remain flat even after expected CD maturities, exit of fully insured government program (TAGP) and Countrywide run-offs Commercial deposits held steady as clients remain highly liquid. We saw minimal impact to opting out of TAGP
Other deposits, primarily CDs with institutional investors, declined $10 B
Comments vs. 4Q09
The growth in average balances ($39 B) was primarily due to additions at the end of 2009 in highly liquid agency mortgage-backed securities and U.S. treasuries
 Increase partially offset by reduction of Credit Card ABS securities due to impact of FAS 166/167 With continued customer deleveraging, liquidity is up nearly $50 B

Home Equity Portfolio Characteristics
90% of portfolio are stand-alone originations versus piggy back loans
$13.2 B legacy Countrywide purchased credit-impaired loan portfolio For the non-purchased credit-impaired portfolio:
 $26.0 B are in first lien position
 $110.7 B are second lien positions
35% or $38.8 B have CLTV greater than 100%
Does not mean that entire second lien position is a loss in the event of default
Assuming proceeds of 89% of the collateral value, we estimate collateral value of $10.7 B available for second liens
Additionally, on 92% of second liens with CLTVs greater than 100%, the customer is current Allowance on the non-purchased credit-impaired home equity portfolio is $8.3 B
2 Charge-offs do not include Countrywide purchased credit-impaired portfolio as they were considered part of the original purchase accounting.
1Q10 losses include $643 M on collateral dependent modified loans and $170 M from consolidation of loans under FAS

1 Product classification is based on the original product classification even if loans were subsequently modified into another product type
2 The lifetime loss ratio represents our current estimate of the lifetime losses of the purchase credit-impaired portfolio as a percentage of the UPB at acquisition. This compares to the original lifetime estimate of losses of 23%.
The remaining pool has a UPB of $46.3 B and is carried, net of allowance, at $32.1 B or 69% of UPB
1Q10 includes an increase in the allowance through provision of $890 M compared to $537 M in 4Q09. The additional provision resulted from portfolio trends and a reassessment of modification impacts as we gain more experience with customers going through the modification process.
While $15.7 B of UPB in this purchased credit-impaired portfolio has become more than 180 days past due, including $10.7 B of first lien and $5.0 B of home equity loans, customers are up-to-date or current on their payments on $24.6 B.
