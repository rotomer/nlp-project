CHARLOTTE  Bank of America Corporation today reported second-quarter 2010 net income of $3.1 billion, compared to net income of $3.2 billion a year ago. After preferred dividends, earnings were $0.27 per diluted share, compared to $0.33 in the second quarter of 2009.
Results were driven by lower credit costs, which improved for the fourth straight quarter, and the sale of non-core assets as the company focused on strengthening key business lines and divesting assets that do not directly contribute to providing financial services to customers. These positives were partially offset by lower trading account profits, reduced mortgage banking income and increased costs associated with the United Kingdom payroll tax on certain year-end incentive payments.
"Our quarterly results show that we are making progress on our strategy to align around our three core customers groups  consumers, businesses, and institutional investors  and create the financial institution that customers tell us they want, built on a broad relationship of clarity, transparency, and helping them manage through challenging times," said Chief Executive Officer and President Brian Moynihan. "We improved our capital foundation through retained earnings, and credit quality improved even faster than expected. We have the most complete financial franchise in the world, and we are focused on executing our strategy and delivering outstanding long-term value to our customers and shareholders."

Second-Quarter 2010 Financial Summary
Revenue and Expense
 
(Dollars in millions)
 
 
 
Revenue, net of interest expense, on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis declined 11 percent from the year-ago period. The year-ago period included gains from the sale of the company's shares in China Construction Bank (CCB) and the contribution of a merchant services business to a joint venture.
Net interest income on a FTE basis increased $1.3 billion from a year earlier, reflecting the impact of the adoption of new consolidation guidance, effective January 1, 2010, which added net assets of approximately $100 billion to the balance sheet. The change, while having no material impact on net income, primarily increased net interest income offset by changes in card income and the provision for credit losses.
The net interest yield widened 13 basis points from the year-ago quarter due in part to the higher yielding loans, which were brought back on the balance sheet related to the adoption of the new consolidation guidance.
Noninterest income declined 23 percent from the year-ago quarter due primarily to lower equity investment income, lower mortgage banking income, reduced trading account profits and lower net gains on sales of debt securities as a result of losses associated with the sale of certain non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. Equity investment income was lower as the prior year period included a $5.3 billion pretax gain on the sale of CCB shares while other income last year included a $3.8 billion pretax gain on the contribution of the merchant services business to a joint venture. The decrease in equity investment income related to the CCB transaction was offset in part by the gains on the sale of non-core assets. The decline in mortgage banking income reflected an increase in representations and warranties expense, lower production volume and margins, and less favorable mortgage servicing rights results, net of hedges. Partially offsetting these decreases

was a $1.2 billion credit-related pretax gain primarily associated with the Merrill Lynch structured notes, compared to a $3.6 billion pretax loss on these structured notes in the year-ago period.
Noninterest expense rose slightly from the year-ago quarter on higher personnel costs due in part to the U.K. payroll tax on certain year-end incentive payments enacted this quarter, and increased professional fees. Pretax merger and restructuring charges declined $321 million from a year earlier.
Credit Quality
 
(Dollars in millions)
 
 
 
Note: Ratios do not include loans measured under the fair value option.
Credit quality continued to improve during the quarter, with net charge-offs continuing to decline in most consumer portfolios. Credit costs, while still high, fell for the fourth consecutive quarter, reflecting continued improvement in relatively weak global economic conditions.
Credit quality across most commercial portfolios continued to improve with reservable criticized levels decreasing for the third consecutive quarter and

Page 6
 
nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties decreasing for the second consecutive quarter. Net charge-offs in the core commercial portfolio declined across a broad range of borrowers and industries.
Net charge-offs were $1.2 billion lower than the first quarter, reflecting improvement in the consumer and commercial portfolios. Specific drivers of the decrease included the higher first-quarter charge-offs on certain modified collateral dependent consumer real estate loans and continued improvement in delinquencies and collections in the domestic credit card portfolio in the second quarter. These improvements were partially offset by losses related to certain foreign credit card renegotiated loans as the company conformed accounting for these loans to domestic charge-off policies. Nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were $35.7 billion, compared with $35.9 billion at March 31, 2010 and $31.0 billion a year ago.
The provision for credit losses was $8.1 billion, $1.7 billion lower than the first quarter and $5.3 billion lower than the same period a year earlier. The provision was $1.45 billion lower than net charge-offs, resulting in a reduction in the reserve for credit losses for the quarter. This compares with a $992 million reduction to the reserve for credit losses in the first quarter and a $4.7 billion addition a year earlier. The reserve reduction in the current quarter was primarily due to improved delinquencies, collections and bankruptcies in domestic credit card and consumer lending businesses, and improved credit profiles in the commercial portfolios. These were partially offset by reserve additions in the consumer real estate portfolios amid continued stress in the housing market, which included reserve additions for purchased credit-impaired consumer portfolios obtained through acquisitions.
Capital and Liquidity Management
 
 
 
 
Capital ratios were positively impacted from the first quarter of 2010 primarily due to the sale of certain non-core assets and increased retained earnings. The company's
 
More
Page 7
 
liquidity position strengthened during the quarter as customers continued to reduce debt. Cash and cash equivalents rose $6.2 billion from the first quarter and $10.7 billion compared to the same period last year. The company's total global excess liquidity sources rose $20 billion from the first quarter of 2010 to approximately $290 billion. At June 30, 2010, the company's time-to-required funding was 22 months.
During the quarter, a cash dividend of $0.01 per common share was paid, and the company reported $340 million in preferred dividends. Period-end common shares issued and outstanding were 10.03 billion for the first and second quarters of 2010 and 8.65 billion for the second quarter of 2009. The increase in outstanding shares year over year was driven primarily by the company's capital-raising initiative in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the related conversion of common equivalent shares into common stock in the first quarter of 2010.
2010 Business Segment Results
Deposits
 
(Dollars in millions)
 
 
 
net income rose 25 percent from the year-ago period due to increases in revenue and lower noninterest expense. Revenue increased as disciplined pricing, a customer shift to more liquid products and a higher residual net interest income allocation related to asset and liability management (ALM) activities, which drove higher net interest income. This was partially offset by lower service charges driven by overdraft policy changes announced in 2009.
Deposits
 
More
Page 8
 
Noninterest expense decreased 4 percent from a year ago due to the absence of the special FDIC assessment, partially offset by higher retail distribution costs that shifted to Deposits from the other consumer businesses.
Average deposits remained relatively flat from a year ago as organic growth and the transfer of certain deposits from other client-managed businesses were offset by the expected decline in higher-yielding Countrywide deposits.
Global Card Services
 
(Dollars in millions)
 
 
 
net income increased $2.4 billion compared to a year ago due to declining credit costs reflecting continued improvement in the U.S. economy.
Global Card Services
Revenue decreased $401 million from a year ago, driven by lower average loans and reduced interest and fee income primarily resulting from the implementation of the CARD Act, partially offset by the $440 million pretax gain on the sale of the MasterCard position.
Provision for credit losses decreased $3.9 billion from a year ago as lower delinquencies, decreasing bankruptcies and lower expected losses from the improving economic outlook drove lower charge-offs and reserve reductions during the quarter.
 
More
Page 9
 
Noninterest expense decreased compared to a year ago as a higher percentage of the retail distribution costs shifted to Deposits from Global Card Services.
Home Loans and Insurance
 
(Dollars in millions)
 
 
 
The net loss in increased $808 million compared to the year-ago period. Revenue decreased 37 percent largely due to lower mortgage banking income. The year-over-year decline in mortgage banking income was driven by the $802 million increase in representations and warranties expense combined with lower production volume and margins resulting from a decrease in refinance activity. Also contributing to the decline were less favorable mortgage servicing results partially offset by increased servicing income.
Home Loans and Insurance
The provision for credit losses decreased $336 million from the year-ago period due to lower reserve additions driven by improving portfolio trends. Provision expense continued to remain elevated amid continued stress in the housing market.
Noninterest expense was essentially flat from a year ago as lower production expenses and a lower insurance loss provision were offset by increased costs related to default management staff and loss mitigation efforts.

Global Commercial Banking

n/m = not meaningful
net income increased $854 million from a year ago due to lower credit costs partially offset by lower revenues.
Global Commercial Banking
Revenue decreased from the same period in the prior year. Net interest income benefited from improved loan spreads on new, renewed and amended facilities offset by loan balance declines. Strong deposit growth contributed to revenue as clients remained very liquid. Revenue was negatively impacted by increased costs related to an agreement to purchase certain loans, partially offset by a higher residual net interest income allocation related to ALM activities.
The provision for credit losses decreased $1.5 billion driven by reserve reductions and lower net charge-offs in the commercial domestic and retail dealer-related portfolios, reflecting improved borrower credit profiles and higher resale values. Also contributing to the decline in provision was the higher level of reserve additions in commercial real estate in the year-ago period.
Average loan balances decreased $28.2 billion compared to the same period a year ago due to continued low demand due in part to client deleveraging and economic uncertainty. Average deposit balances continued to grow, increasing by $19.4 billion as clients remain very liquid.

Global Banking and Markets
 
(Dollars in millions)
 
 
 
net income decreased $3.0 billion compared to a year earlier, as the year-ago period included a gain on the contribution of the merchant services business to a joint venture and the most recent period was impacted by a widespread market slowdown in the sales and trading businesses.
Global Banking and Markets
Revenue decreased $4.4 billion due to the lack of the $3.8 billion gain on the contribution of the merchant services business in 2009, as well as general market deterioration resulting from market concerns around the global economy and the lack of liquidity as sovereign debt fears and regulatory uncertainty fueled investor concerns. Noninterest expense increased $870 million driven by the U.K. payroll tax on certain year-end incentive payments and the recognition of expense on proportionately larger prior year incentive deferrals. Provision for credit losses declined from a year ago primarily driven by an improved risk portfolio. This resulted in reserve reductions and lower charge-offs in the corporate portfolio, reflecting stabilizing borrower cash flows and improved borrower liquidity.
Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities revenue fell to $2.6 billion, compared to $3.1 billion a year ago, due to spread widening and a decline in liquidity reflecting increased investor risk aversion and greater economic uncertainty.
Equities revenue declined to $1.0 billion compared to $1.3 billion a year ago driven primarily by lower sales and trading revenues of $852 million due to adverse market conditions and reductions in equity derivatives revenue.
Corporate and Investment Banking revenue of $2.4 billion included Corporate Banking revenue of $1.6 billion. Excluding the merchant services gain in the prior year, Corporate and Investment Banking revenue was up $210 million year over

year, largely as a result of an increase in net interest income and growth in fee revenue.
Global Wealth and Investment Management
 
(Dollars in millions)
 
 
 
net income declined $40 million from a year earlier driven in part by the tax-related effects of the sale of the former Columbia Management long-term asset management business, partially offset by higher investment and brokerage activity and lower credit costs.
Global Wealth and Investment Management
Revenue increased $369 million from a year earlier to $4.3 billion, which represents Global Wealth and Investment Management's highest quarterly revenue other than the fourth quarter of 2009, which included a $1.1 billion gain related to the company's equity investment in BlackRock, Inc. The increase was driven by higher investment and brokerage income, higher net interest income compared to the second quarter of 2009, and the pretax gain on the sale of Columbia Management's long-term asset management business. The provision for credit losses decreased $117 million from a year ago to $121 million due to improvement in the consumer real estate portfolio.
Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management net revenue increased $234 million from a year earlier due to higher investment and brokerage income driven by the impact of
 
More
Page 13
 
higher average equity market levels, increased AUM flows, and higher transactional brokerage activity, as well as higher net interest income.
U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management, and Retirement and Philanthropic Services net revenue increased $29 million and $15 million, respectively from a year ago due to improved net interest margin at U.S. Trust and higher valuations in the equity markets in Retirement and Philanthropic Services.
Global Wealth and Investment Management also includes the results of BofA Global Capital Management, which is the cash and liquidity asset management business that Bank of America retained following the sale of Columbia Management's long-term asset management business and the economic ownership interest related to the company's investment in BlackRock, Inc.
All Other
reported net income of $1.1 billion, up $346 million from a year ago due to higher net revenue driven by a $1.2 billion pretax gain on the sale of shares of Ita and credit-related gains primarily associated with the Merrill Lynch structured notes of $1.2 billion, partially offset by increases in the provision for credit losses and noninterest expense.
All Other
The increase in provision for credit losses was driven by the impact of the new consolidation guidance, partially offset by lower reserve additions related to the residential mortgage and the discontinued real estate purchased credit-impaired portfolios. Results were also impacted by lower gains on sales of debt securities as a result of net losses on sales of certain non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. Noninterest expense increased due to higher personnel, general operating and other expenses.
All Other consists primarily of equity investments, the residential mortgage portfolio associated with ALM activities, the residual impact of the cost allocation process, merger and restructuring charges, intersegment eliminations, fair value adjustments related to certain Merrill Lynch structured notes and the results of certain consumer finance, investment management and commercial lending businesses that are being liquidated. Prior to January 1, 2010, All Other also included the offsetting securitization impact to present Global Card Services on a managed basis.

Reconciliation to GAAP Financial Measures
 
(Dollars in millions, shares in thousands)
The Corporation evaluates its business based upon a FTE basis which is a non-GAAP measure. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on a FTE basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to a FTE basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The Corporation also evaluates its business based upon ratios that utilize tangible equity which is a non-GAAP measure. The tangible equity ratio represents total shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible common equity ratio represents common shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents ending common shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity (i.e., capital). We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation.
Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. See the tables below for corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures at June 30, 2010, March 31, 2010 and June 30, 2009, and for the six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009. We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation.

Reconciliation - Managed to GAAP
 
(Dollars in millions)
In 2010, the Corporation reports results in accordance with new consolidation guidance. The 2009 periods are presented on a managed basis. Managed basis assumes that securitized loans were not sold and presents earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold (i.e., held loans) are presented. Loan securitization is an alternative funding process that is used by the Corporation to diversify funding sources. In prior periods, loan securitization removed loans from the Consolidated Balance Sheet through the sale of loans to an off-balance sheet qualifying special purpose entity which was excluded from the Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP applicable at the time.
Global Card Services
The performance of the managed portfolio is important in understanding results as it demonstrates the results of the entire portfolio serviced by the business. Securitized loans continue to be serviced by the business and are subject to the same underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring as held loans. In addition, excess servicing income is exposed to similar credit risk and repricing of interest rates as held loans. In prior periods, managed income statement line items differed from a held basis reported as follows:

 -  Non-personnel costs declined 2% from 1Q10 and 8% from 2Q09
 -  Personnel expenses are down $369 M from 1Q10
 $758 M related to the impact of expenses from retirement eligible grants in 1Q10
 Excluding the retirement eligible grants expense and the UK payroll tax, personnel expense

 Tier 1 of 10.67% and Tier 1 Common of 8.01%
 -  Tangible Book Value at $12.14 per share, a 4% increase from 1Q10
 -  3Q10 equity levels will benefit from the initial mark to market through OCI of our ownership position in China Construction Bank currently carried at cost
 Majority of shares become unrestricted in 3Q11 resulting in a mark in equity beginning one year prior (no benefit to Tier 1 capital)

Commentary on Regulatory Reform
 -  CARD Act
 Total 2010 expected interest and fees impact, net of mitigation, to be roughly $1 B after-tax
 -  Regulation E / Overdraft policy changes
 Previously disclosed 2010 impact $1 B after-tax, before any mitigation
 -  4Q10 total service charges expected to reduce to roughly $2 B pre-tax
 -  Dodd/Frank Bill
 Uncertainties remain as hundreds of rules need to be written by multiple regulators
 Impacts to businesses and clients are uncertain
 Impacts will be phased in over many different timeframes
 Mitigations for potential impacts are under assessment
 -  Bank of America remains committed to support of customers and integrity of the financial system
 We understand and highly regard our fiduciary responsibility to our customer and clients
 We operate an integrated customer-focused business model, not proprietary businesses
 Our capital and liquidity are strong and growing
 
Comments on Impact of Durbin Amendment
 -  The Financial Reform Bill including the Durbin Amendment is expected to be signed into law in the near future giving the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) authority over setting debit card interchange fees received or charged by an issuer. The Durbin Amendment will be subject to interpretation and final rule making by the FRB for a period up to nine months post enactment of the rule.
 -  All of our consumer and small business card products, including our debit card business, are part of an integrated platform within the Global Card Services segment.
 -  We estimate that our debit card revenue for 2010 will be approximately $2.9 billion. Although subject to final rule making over the next year, we estimate that the decrease in annualized revenue before mitigation could be as much as $1.8 billion to $2.3 billion starting in the third quarter of 2011.
 -  The estimated shortfall in revenue would impact the carrying value of the $22 billion of goodwill currently included in the Global Card Services segment. Utilizing these revenue estimates, the estimated impairment of goodwill to be reported in the third quarter of 2010 would potentially be in the range of $7 billion to $10 billion. The amount of impairment recorded in the third quarter will be after consideration of the value of mitigation initiatives applicable to Global Card Services that exist at that time.
 -  The non-cash impairment charge would have no impact to reported Tier 1 and Tangible Equity Capital ratios.

Exhibit A: Non-GAAP Reconciliations
Bank of America Corporation and Subsidiaries
Reconciliation to GAAP Financial Measures
 
(Dollars in millions, shares in thousands)
The Corporation evaluates its business based upon a fully taxable-equivalent basis which is a non-GAAP measure. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to a fully taxable-equivalent basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The Corporation also evaluates its business based upon ratios that utilize tangible equity which is a non-GAAP measure. Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of common shareholders' equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of average shareholders' equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible common equity ratio represents common shareholders' equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible equity ratio represents total shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents ending common shareholders' equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by ending common shares outstanding plus any common shares issued upon assumed conversion of common equivalent shares. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity (i.e., capital). In addition, profitability, relationship, and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders' equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. Also, the efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue. We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation.
Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. See the tables below for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the three months ended June 30, 2010, March 31, 2010, December 31, 2009, September 30, 2009 and June 30, 2009 and the six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009.

In 2010, the Corporation reports results in accordance with new consolidation guidance. The 2009 periods are presented on a managed basis. Managed basis assumes that securitized loans were not sold and presents earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold (i.e., held loans) are presented. Loan securitization is an alternative funding process that is used by the Corporation to diversify funding sources. In prior periods, loan securitization removed loans from the Consolidated Balance Sheet through the sale of loans to an off-balance sheet qualifying special purpose entity which was excluded from the Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP applicable at the time.
Global Card Services
The performance of the managed portfolio is important in understanding results as it demonstrates the results of the entire portfolio serviced by the business. Securitized loans continue to be serviced by the business and are subject to the same underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring as held loans. In addition, excess servicing income is exposed to similar credit risk and repricing of interest rates as held loans. In prior periods, managed income statement line items differed from a held basis reported as follows:

Focus on Home Equity Loans
Home Equity Portfolio Characteristics
 - 90% of portfolio are stand-alone originations versus piggy back loans
 - $13.0 B legacy Countrywide purchased
Non-purchased credit-impaired second lien
First lien
credit-impaired loan portfolio
 - For the non-purchased credit-impaired portfolio:
 $25.7 B are in first lien position
 $107.6 B are second lien positions
 -  38% or $40.6 B have CLTVs greater than 100%
 Does not mean that entire second lien position is a loss
in the event of default
 Assuming proceeds of 85% of the collateral value, we
estimate collateral value of $11.5 B available for second
liens
 Additionally, on 94% of second liens with CLTVs greater than 100%, the customer is current
 - Allowance on the non-purchased credit-impaired home equity portfolio is $8.7 B
Net charge-offs include $643M in 1Q10 and $128M in 2Q10 on collateral dependent modified loans, and $170M in 1Q10 and $126M in 2Q10 from consolidation of loans under FAS 166/167
Note: Charge-offs do not include Countrywide purchased credit-impaired portfolio as they were considered part of the original purchase accounting.
