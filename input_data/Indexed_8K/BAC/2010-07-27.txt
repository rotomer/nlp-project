Euro Medium-Term Note Program
Bank of America Corporation (the "Registrant") maintains a Euro Medium-Term Note Program (the "EMTN Program") which provides for the issuance, from time to time, of its senior and subordinated debt securities in international capital markets. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Program Agreement dated as of July 25, 2008, as amended and supplemented by the Supplemental Agreement to the Amended and Restated Program Agreement dated July 22, 2009 and the Supplemental Agreement to the Amended and Restated Program Agreement dated July 22, 2010 among the Registrant, Merrill Lynch International and the other Dealers named therein, the maximum aggregate principal amount authorized to be outstanding at any time under the EMTN Program is U.S. $65 billion (or the equivalent in other currencies). Under the EMTN Program, the notes are issued pursuant to the terms of an Amended and Restated Agency Agreement dated as of July 22, 2010 among the Registrant, Bank of America, N.A., London Branch, as Principal Agent, and Merrill Lynch International Bank Limited, as Registrar and Transfer Agent (the "Agency Agreement"). A copy of the Agency Agreement is filed hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.
Terms of the notes, including currency, rate and maturity, are agreed between the Registrant and the purchasers of the notes at the time of sale.
Notes issued under the EMTN Program are issued pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"); are not registered under the Act; and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to a U.S. person absent registration under, or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of, the Act.
As of the date of this report, there is approximately U.S. $41.750 billion (or its equivalent in other currencies) in principal amount of notes outstanding under the EMTN Program, leaving approximately U.S. $23.250 billion (or its equivalent in other currencies) available for issuance under the EMTN Program.
 
 
The following exhibit is filed herewith:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

(3) Upon any exchange of all or a part of an interest in a Bearer Temporary Global Note for an interest in a Bearer Permanent Global Note or upon any exchange of all or a part of an interest in either a Bearer Temporary Global Note or a Bearer Permanent Global Note for Bearer Definitive Notes, the Principal Agent shall (i) procure that the relevant Global Note shall, if it is a CGN, be endorsed by or on behalf of the Principal Agent to reflect the reduction of its nominal amount by the aggregate nominal amount so exchanged and, where applicable, the Bearer Permanent Global Note shall be endorsed by or on behalf of the Principal Agent to reflect the increases in its nominal amount as a result of any exchange for an interest in the Bearer Temporary Global Note or (ii) in the case of any Bearer Global Note which is a NGN, instruct Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg to make appropriate entries in their records to reflect such exchange. Until exchanged in full, the holder of an interest in any Bearer Global Note shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Agreement as the holder of Bearer Definitive Notes, Receipts and Coupons authenticated and delivered under this Agreement, subject as set out in the Terms and Conditions. The Principal Agent is authorized on behalf of the Issuer and instructed (a) in the case of any Global Note which is a CGN, to endorse or to arrange for the endorsement of the relevant Global Note to reflect the reduction in the nominal amount represented by it by the amount so exchanged and, if appropriate, to endorse the Bearer Permanent Global Note to reflect any increase in the nominal amount represented by it and, in either case, to sign in the relevant space on the relevant Global Note recording the exchange and reduction or increase, (b) in the case of any Global Note which is a NGN, to instruct Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg to make appropriate entries in their records to reflect such exchange and (c) in the case of a total exchange, to cancel or arrange for the cancellation of the relevant Global Note.

Issue of Definitive Notes and Registered Definitive Certificates
(1) Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Final Terms, on or after the Exchange Date interests in a Bearer Global Note will be exchangeable for Bearer Definitive Notes with Coupons attached: (i) as to Bearer Permanent Global Notes, on not less than 60 calendar days' written notice from Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg (acting on the instructions of any holder of an interest in the applicable Bearer Permanent Global Note), (ii) if an Event of Default (as defined in the Terms and Conditions) occurs and is continuing, (iii) if the Issuer is notified that either Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg has been closed for business for a continuous period of 14 calendar days (other than by reason of holiday, statutory requirement or otherwise) after the original issuance of the Bearer Notes or has announced an intention permanently to cease business or has in fact done so and no alternative clearance system approved by the Noteholders is available, or (iv) if the Issuer, after notice to the Principal Agent, determines to issue the applicable Bearer Notes in definitive form. Upon the occurrence of these events, the Principal Agent shall deliver the relevant Bearer Definitive Note(s) in accordance with the terms of the relevant Bearer Global Note. For this purpose, the Principal Agent is hereby authorized on behalf of the Issuer:
(a) to authenticate such Bearer Definitive Note(s) in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; and

The Principal Agent shall notify the Issuer forthwith upon receipt of a request for issue of Bearer Definitive Note(s) in accordance with the provisions of a Bearer Global Note and this Agreement (and the aggregate principal amount of such Bearer Temporary Global Note or Bearer Permanent Global Note, as the case may be, to be exchanged in connection therewith).
(2) Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Final Terms, interests in a Registered Global Note will be exchangeable for Registered Definitive Notes: (i) if the Issuer is notified that Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg has been closed for business for a continuous period of 14 calendar days (other than by reason of holiday, statutory requirement or otherwise) after the issuance of the Registered Global Note or has announced an intention permanently to cease business or has in fact done so and no alternative clearance system approved by the Noteholders is available, (ii) if an Event of Default (as defined in the Terms and Conditions) occurs and is continuing, or (iii) if the Issuer, after notice to the Principal Agent, determines to issue the applicable Registered Notes in definitive form. Upon the occurrence of these events, the Principal Agent shall deliver the relevant Registered Definitive Certificates in accordance with the terms of the relevant Registered Global Note. For this purpose, the Registrar is hereby authorized on behalf of the Issuer:
(a) to authenticate such Registered Definitive Certificates in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; and
(b) to deliver such Registered Definitive Certificates to or to the order of Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or any alternative clearing system in exchange for such Registered Global Certificate.
(3) The Issuer undertakes to deliver to the Principal Agent and the Registrar sufficient numbers of executed Bearer Definitive Notes with, if applicable, Receipts, Coupons and Talons attached, and sufficient numbers of Registered Definitive Certificates to enable the Principal Agent and the Registrar to comply with their respective obligations under this Clause 7.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Principal Agent shall not deliver a Bearer Definitive Note unless a certification of non-U.S. beneficial ownership is furnished or has previously been received. Any such certification shall contain all certifications and information set forth in the form set out in Schedule 7 hereto, and shall be retained by the Principal Agent, and a copy shall be furnished to the Issuer, in accordance with Clause 6(1)(c) above.

Terms of Issue
(1) The Principal Agent and Registrar shall cause all Bearer Temporary Global Notes, Bearer Permanent Global Notes, Bearer Definitive Notes, Registered Global Certificates and Registered Definitive Certificates that are delivered to and held by it under this Agreement to be maintained in safe custody and shall ensure that such Notes are issued only in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the relevant Global Note and the Terms and Conditions.
(2) Subject to the procedures set out in the Procedures Memorandum, for the purposes of Clause 5(1), the Principal Agent and Registrar are entitled to treat a telephone, email or facsimile communication from a person purporting to be (and who the Principal Agent or Registrar believes in good faith to be) the authorized representative of the Issuer named in the lists referred to in, or notified pursuant to, Clause 21(7) as sufficient instructions and authority of the Issuer for the Principal Agent or Registrar, as applicable, to act in accordance with Clause 5(l).
(3) If a person who has signed on behalf of the Issuer any Bearer Note or Registered Certificate not yet issued but held by the Principal Agent or Registrar in accordance with Clause 5(1) ceases to be authorized as described in Clause 21(7), the Principal Agent or Registrar, as applicable (unless the Issuer gives notice to the Principal Agent or Registrar, as applicable, that Notes signed by that person do not constitute valid and binding obligations of the Issuer or otherwise until replacements have been provided to the Principal Agent or Registrar, as applicable), shall continue to have authority to issue any such Notes, and the Issuer hereby warrants to the Principal Agent and Registrar that such Notes shall be, unless notified as aforesaid, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer. Promptly upon such person ceasing to be authorized, the Issuer shall provide the Principal Agent with replacement Bearer Notes or Registered Certificates (as applicable). Upon receipt of such replacement Bearer Notes or Registered Certificates, the Principal Agent or Registrar, as applicable, shall cancel and destroy the Bearer Notes or Registered Certificates held by it which are signed by such person and upon written request shall provide to the Issuer a confirmation of destruction in respect thereof specifying the Bearer Notes or Registered Certificates so cancelled and destroyed.
(4) If the Principal Agent pays an amount (the "Advance") to the Issuer on the basis that a payment (the "Payment") has been, or will be, received from a Dealer and if the Payment is not received by the Principal Agent on the date the Principal Agent pays the Issuer, the Principal Agent shall notify the Issuer by facsimile or email that the Payment has not been received and the Issuer shall repay to the Principal Agent the Advance and shall pay interest on the Advance (or the unreimbursed portion thereof) from (and including) the date such Advance is made to (but excluding) the earlier of repayment of the Advance and receipt by the Principal Agent of the Payment (at a rate quoted at that time by the Principal Agent as its cost of funding the Advance).
(5) Except in the case of issues where the Principal Agent does not act as receiving bank for the Issuer in respect of the purchase price of the Notes being issued, if on the relevant Issue Date, a Dealer does not pay the full purchase price due from it in respect of any Note (the "Defaulted Note") and, as a result, the Defaulted Note remains in the Principal Agent's distribution account with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg after such Issue Date, the Principal Agent will continue to hold the Defaulted Note pursuant to the order of the Issuer. The Principal Agent shall notify the Issuer forthwith of the failure of the Dealer to pay the full purchase price due from it in respect of any Defaulted Note and, subsequently, shall notify the Issuer forthwith upon receipt from the Dealer of the full purchase price in respect of such Defaulted Note and to pay to the Issuer the amount so received.
9.
Payments
(1) Subject to sub-clause 12 below, the Principal Agent shall advise the Issuer, as soon as shall be practicable preceding the date on which any payment is to be made to the Principal Agent pursuant to this sub-clause (1) of the payment amount, value date and payment instructions and the Issuer will before 10:00 a.m. (London time) on each date on which any payment in respect of any Notes issued by it becomes due, transfer to an account specified by the Principal Agent such amount in the relevant currency as shall be sufficient for the purposes of such payment in funds settled through such payment system as the Principal Agent and the Issuer may agree.
 
(2) The Issuer will ensure that no later than 4:00 p.m. (London time) on the second Business Day (as defined below) immediately preceding the date on which any payment is to be made to the Principal Agent pursuant to sub-clause (1), the Principal Agent shall receive from the paying bank of the Issuer an irrevocable confirmation in the form of an authenticated SWIFT message that such payment shall be made. For the purposes of this Clause 9, "Business Day" means a day which is both:
(a) a day (other than a Saturday or Sunday) on which commercial banks and foreign exchange markets settle payments and are open for general business (including dealing in foreign exchange and foreign currency deposits) in London and New York and any additional business center(s) specified in the applicable Final Terms ("Additional Business Center(s)"); and
(b) either (1) for any sum payable in a Specified Currency other than euro, a day on which commercial banks and foreign exchange markets settle payments and are open for general business (including dealing in foreign exchange and foreign currency deposits) in the principal financial centers (as defined below) of the country of the relevant Specified Currency (if other than London) or (2) for any sum payable in euro, a day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer System ("TARGET2 System") or any successor thereto is operating.
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Final Terms, the principal financial center of any country for the purpose of this Clause 9 shall be the relevant financial centers (if any) specified for the relevant Specified Currency in Section 1.5 or Section 1.6 of the ISDA Definitions, except that the principal financial center for Australian Dollars shall be Melbourne and Sydney, the principal financial center for Canadian Dollars shall be Toronto, and the principal financial center for New Zealand Dollars shall be Wellington.
(3) The Principal Agent shall ensure that payments of principal, interest and any other amount in respect of any Bearer Temporary Global Note will be made only to the extent that certification of non-U.S. beneficial ownership as required by U.S. Treasury regulations has been received from Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg in accordance with the terms thereof. Any such certification shall contain all certifications and information set forth in the form set out in Schedule 7, and be retained by the Principal Agent, and a copy shall be furnished to the Issuer, in accordance with Clause 6(1)(c) above.
(4) Subject to the receipt by the Principal Agent of payment as provided in sub-clause (1) above, the Principal Agent or the relevant Paying Agent shall pay or cause to be paid all amounts due in respect of the Notes on behalf of the Issuer in the manner provided in the Terms and Conditions. If any payment provided for in sub-clause (l) is made late but otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Principal Agent and each Paying Agent shall nevertheless make payments in respect of the Notes as aforesaid following receipt by it of such payment.
(5) If for any reason the Principal Agent considers in its sole discretion that the amounts to be received by the Principal Agent pursuant to sub-clause (1) will be, or the amounts actually received by it pursuant thereto are, insufficient to satisfy all claims in respect of all payments then falling due in respect of the Notes, neither the Principal Agent nor any Paying Agent shall be obliged to pay any such claims until the Principal Agent has received the full amount of all such payments. Should the Principal Agent or any Paying Agent elect not to make payment of amounts falling due in respect of the Notes as aforesaid, it shall advise the Issuer of any such decision as soon as practicable by telephone with confirmation by facsimile or e-mail.
(6) Without prejudice to sub-clauses (4) and (5), if the Principal Agent pays any amounts to the holders of Notes, Receipts or Coupons or to any Paying Agent at a time when it has not received payment in full in respect of the relevant Notes in accordance with sub-clause (1) (the excess of the amounts so paid over the amounts so received being the "Shortfall"), the Issuer will, in addition to paying amounts due under sub-clause (l), pay to the Principal Agent on demand interest (at a rate which represents the Principal Agent's cost of funding the Shortfall) on the Shortfall (or the unreimbursed portion thereof) until the receipt in full by the Principal Agent of the Shortfall.
 
(7) The Principal Agent shall on demand promptly reimburse each Paying Agent for payments in respect of Notes properly made by such Paying Agent in accordance with this Agreement and the Terms and Conditions unless the Principal Agent has notified the Paying Agent, prior to the opening of business in the location of the office of the Paying Agent through which payment in respect of the Notes can be made prior to the day on which such Principal Agent has to give payment instructions in respect of the due date of a payment in respect of the Notes, that the Principal Agent does not expect to receive sufficient funds to make payment of all amounts falling due in respect of such Notes.
(8) If the Principal Agent pays out funds on or after the due date therefor, or becomes liable to pay out funds, on the assumption that a corresponding payment by the Issuer has been or will be made and such payment has in fact not been made by the Issuer, then the Issuer shall on demand reimburse the Principal Agent for the relevant amount, and pay interest to the Principal Agent on such amount from the date on which it is paid out to the date of reimbursement at a rate per annum equal to the cost to the Principal Agent of funding the amount paid out, as certified by the Principal Agent and expressed as a rate per annum. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of the Terms and Conditions as to subordination shall not apply to the Issuer's obligations under this sub-clause (8).
(9) While any Notes are represented by a Bearer Global Note or a Registered Global Certificate, all payments or deliveries due in respect of such Notes shall be made to, or to the order of, the holder of the Bearer Global Note or with respect to the Registered Global Certificate, the person or persons for the time being shown in the Register maintained by the Registrar as the Noteholder or Noteholders, subject to, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Bearer Global Note or Registered Global Certificate. In the case of a CGN, the Paying Agent to which any Bearer Global Note was presented for the purpose of making such payment shall cause the appropriate Schedule to the relevant Global Note to be annotated so as to evidence the amounts and dates of such payments of principal, interest or other amounts, as applicable. In the case of any Bearer Global Note which is a NGN, the Principal Agent shall instruct Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg to make appropriate entries in their records to reflect such payment.
(10) All payments in respect of any Bearer Note shall be made outside the United States and its possessions and shall not be made by transfer to an account at a bank, or delivered to an address, located inside the United States or its possessions by any office or agency of the Issuer, the Principal Agent, or any Paying Agent. Terms used in this sub-clause shall have the meanings given to them by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and regulations thereunder.
(11) If the amount of principal, interest or other amounts then due for payment is not paid in full (otherwise than by reason of a deduction required by law to be made therefrom), (i) the Paying Agent to which a Bearer Note is presented for the purpose of making such payment shall, unless the Bearer Note is a NGN, make a record of such shortfall on the Bearer Note and such record shall, in the absence of manifest error, be prima facie evidence that the payment in question has not to that extent been made or (ii) in the case of any Bearer Global Note which is a NGN, the Principal Agent shall instruct Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg to make appropriate entries in their records to reflect such shortfall in payment.
(12) If any payments or deliveries due on any Physical Delivery Notes, as defined in the Terms and Conditions, including pursuant to sub-clause 10 above, are required to be paid by delivery of any asset other than cash, then neither the Principal Agent nor any Paying Agent shall be responsible hereunder for the delivery of such non-cash consideration. Instead, the delivery of such non-cash consideration shall be effected or procured by the Delivery Agent in the manner provided by the Delivery Agency Agreement upon receipt of an Asset Transfer Notice from the relevant Noteholder in the manner contemplated by the Terms and Conditions. No Entitlement shall be delivered in the United States or its possessions, transferred to an account at a bank or delivered to an address located inside the United States or its possessions, or to, or for the account or benefit of, a U.S. person (as defined in Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended). For purposes of taking any action required to be taken by the Principal Agent hereunder, including, but not limited to, any notations required to be made on the Notes, the Principal Agent may rely upon any notification delivered to it by the Delivery Agent pursuant to the Delivery Agency Agreement as to the amounts delivered by the Delivery Agent thereunder (or any shortfall, as the case may be) on any Interest Payment Date, Maturity Date, or any other relevant payment date.

(1) The Principal Agent shall make all such determinations and calculations (howsoever described) as it is required to do under the Terms and Conditions, all subject to and in accordance with the Terms and Conditions, provided that certain calculations with respect to the Notes, and associated publication or notification, shall be made by the relevant Calculation Agent in accordance with the relevant Calculation Agency Agreement.
(2) For the purposes of monitoring the aggregate principal amount of Notes issued under the Program, the Principal Agent shall determine the U.S. Dollar equivalent of the principal amount of each issue of Notes denominated in another currency, each issue of Zero Coupon Notes, Dual Currency Notes, Index Linked Notes, Share Linked Notes, GDR/ADR Linked Notes, FX Linked Notes, Commodity Linked Notes, Fund Linked Notes, Inflation Linked Notes, Hybrid Notes, Installment Notes, Partly Paid Notes, Notes Linked to other Underlying Assets, and Amortizing Notes as follows:
(a) the U.S. Dollar equivalent of Notes denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars shall be determined as of the Agreement Date for such Notes on the basis of the spot rate for the sale of the U.S. Dollar against the purchase of the relevant currency quoted by a foreign exchange dealer selected by the Issuer on the relevant day of calculation;
(b) the U.S. Dollar equivalent of Dual Currency Notes, Index Linked Notes, Share Linked Notes, GDR/ADR Linked Notes, FX Linked Notes, Commodity Linked Notes, Fund Linked Notes, Inflation Linked Notes, Hybrid Notes, and Notes Linked to other Underlying Assets shall be determined by reference to the original nominal amount of such Notes;

(d) the U.S. Dollar equivalent of Zero Coupon Notes and other Notes that are issued at a discount or premium (other than a de minimis discount in the ordinary course), shall be determined by reference to the net proceeds received by the Issuer for the relevant issue; and
(e) the U.S. Dollar equivalent of Installment Notes and Amortizing Notes, shall be determined by reference to the Specified Denomination of such Notes, less the aggregate of all amounts of principal paid on such Notes up to the relevant day of determination.
11.
Withholding Taxes
(1) Prior to the first payment on any Note, the Principal Agent shall have submitted to the Issuer, or shall have on file with the Issuer, a properly executed Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Form W-9, and any Paying Agent with respect to such Note shall have submitted to the Issuer, or shall have on file with the Issuer, such IRS form as the Issuer shall determine to be necessary or advisable.
(2) In respect of all Notes the payments on which are specified in the applicable Final Terms as being subject to United States withholding taxes, the Principal Agent and any Paying Agent with respect to such Note shall, unless otherwise notified by the Issuer, withhold United States federal income tax in accordance with U.S. law on all payments as specified in the applicable Final Terms, forward the amount withheld to the IRS, and comply with any U.S. tax reporting requirements.
(3) If the Issuer, in respect of any payment not described in Clause 11(2) above, is required to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges, the Issuer shall give written notice thereof to the Principal Agent and any Paying Agent with respect to such Note as soon as it becomes aware of the requirement to make such withholding or deduction and shall give to the Principal Agent and such Paying Agent such information as the Principal Agent or such Paying Agent shall require to enable it to comply with such requirement, and the Principal Agent and Paying Agent shall comply with such requirement.
 
(4) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in respect of all Registered Notes, the Principal Agent and any Paying Agent with respect to the Notes shall collect IRS Forms W-8BEN, W-8IMY, W-9 (or any successor forms thereto) or other appropriate tax forms from the Noteholders and withhold taxes to the extent required by law.
(5) The Principal Agent and any Paying Agent with respect to a Note shall report payments to the Noteholders and the IRS as appropriate under U.S. law.
(6) The Principal Agent and any Paying Agent with respect to a Note shall provide the Issuer with any information required by the Issuer in connection with the Principal Agent's compliance with the tax requirements of this Clause 11.
12.
Duties of the Principal Agent in Connection with Early Redemption, Put Notices and Asset Transfer Notices
(1) If so permitted by the applicable Final Terms, and subject to the provisions of the Terms and Conditions, if the Issuer decides to redeem any outstanding Notes (in whole or in part) for the time being outstanding prior to their Maturity Date or the Interest Payment Date falling in the redemption month (as the case may be) in accordance with the Terms and Conditions, the Issuer shall give 7 calendar days written notice of such decision to the Principal Agent on or prior to the date on which the Issuer will give notice of such redemption to the Noteholders in accordance with the Terms and Conditions in order to enable the Principal Agent to undertake its obligations herein and in the Terms and Conditions.
(2) Where partial redemptions are to be effected when there are Definitive Notes outstanding, the Principal Agent will select by lot the Notes to be redeemed from the outstanding Notes in compliance with all applicable laws and stock exchange requirements and deemed by the Principal Agent to be appropriate and fair. Where partial redemptions are to be effected when there are no Definitive Notes outstanding, the rights of Noteholders will be governed by the standard provisions of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg (to be reflected in the records of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg as either a pool factor or a reduction in nominal amount, at their discretion). Notice of any partial redemption and, when there are Definitive Notes outstanding, of the serial numbers of the Bearer Definitive Notes or Registered Definitive Certificates so drawn, will be given by the Principal Agent to the Noteholders in accordance with the terms of the Notes and this Agreement. Any selection required to be made by the Principal Agent pursuant to this Clause 12(2) shall be made in accordance with the Terms and Conditions, but the Principal Agent shall give the Issuer reasonable notice of the time and place proposed for such selection.
(3) On behalf of and at the expense of the Issuer, the Principal Agent shall publish the notice required in connection with any such redemption and shall at the same time also publish a separate list of the serial numbers of any Bearer Definitive Notes or Registered Definitive Certificates previously selected and not presented for redemption. Such notice shall specify the date fixed for redemption, the redemption amount, the record date, the manner in which redemption will be effected and, in the case of a partial redemption, the serial numbers of the Notes to be redeemed (in the case of Definitive Notes) and the nominal amounts of the Notes to be redeemed. Such notice will be published in accordance with the Terms and Conditions. The Principal Agent also will notify the other Paying Agents of any date fixed for redemption of any Notes. In addition, the Principal Agent shall send to each holder of Registered Notes that are called in whole or in part for redemption or exercise of any option, at its address shown in the Register, a copy of such notice together with details of such Noteholder's Registered Notes called for redemption or subject to any option and the extent of such redemption or the terms of the exercise of such option.
(4) Immediately prior to the date on which any notice of redemption is to be given to the Noteholders, the Issuer shall deliver to the Principal Agent a certificate stating that the Issuer is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth in reasonable detail a statement of facts showing that all conditions precedent to such redemption have occurred or been satisfied and shall comply with all notice requirements provided for in the Terms and Conditions.
 
(5) Each Paying Agent, with respect to Bearer Notes, and each Transfer Agent, with respect to Registered Notes, will keep a stock of Put Notices for Bearer Definitive Notes or Registered Definitive Notes in the form set out in Schedule 10 hereto, and will make such notices available on demand to Noteholders of such Notes for which the Terms and Conditions provide for redemption at the option of Noteholders. Each Paying Agent, with respect to Bearer Notes, or Transfer Agent, with respect to Registered Notes, shall promptly transfer a copy of any valid Put Notice that it receives to the Issuer and the Principal Agent. Upon receipt of any Bearer Definitive Note or Registered Definitive Certificate deposited in the exercise of such option in accordance with the Terms and Conditions, the Paying Agent, with respect to Bearer Notes, or Transfer Agent, with respect to Registered Notes, with which such Bearer Note or Registered Certificate is deposited shall hold such Bearer Note (together with any Coupons, if any, relating to it and deposited with it) or Registered Certificate on behalf of the depositing Noteholder (but shall not, save as provided below, release it) until the due date for redemption of the relevant Note consequent upon the exercise of such option, when, subject as provided below and Clause 9(12) above, it shall present such Bearer Note (and any such Coupons, if any) to itself and the Issuer for payment of the amount due thereon together with any interest and any other amounts due on such date in accordance with the Terms and Conditions and shall pay such amounts in accordance with Condition 6, and if applicable, the directions of such Noteholder contained in the Put Notice. In the event of exercise of any other option, each Paying Agent, with respect to Bearer Notes, or Transfer Agent, with respect to Registered Notes, shall take steps required of it in the Terms and Conditions and, in the case of Registered Notes, Clause 17. If, prior to such due date for its redemption, such Note becomes immediately due and payable or if upon due presentation payment of such redemption monies is improperly withheld or refused, the applicable Paying Agent or Transfer Agent shall post such Bearer Note (together with any such Coupons, if any) or such Registered Certificate by uninsured post to, and at the risk of, the relevant Noteholder unless the Noteholder has otherwise requested and paid the costs of such insurance to the relevant Paying Agent at the time of depositing the Bearer Notes or Registered Certificates at such address outside the United States and its possessions as may have been given by the Noteholder in the Put Notice or, in the case of Registered Notes where no address has been given, to the address appearing in the Register. At the end of each period for the exercise of such option, each Paying Agent and each Transfer Agent shall promptly notify the Principal Agent of the principal amount of the Notes in respect of which such option has been exercised with it, together with their serial numbers (or those of the Registered Certificates representing them), and the Principal Agent shall promptly notify such details to the Issuer.
(6) Each Paying Agent and Transfer Agent will keep a stock of Asset Transfer Notices for (in the case of the Paying Agents) Bearer Definitive Notes and (in the case of the Transfer Agent) Registered Definitive Notes which are Physical Delivery Notes in the form set out in Schedule 13, and will make such notices available on demand to holders of such Notes. Each Paying Agent, with respect to Bearer Notes, and the Transfer Agent, with respect to Registered Notes, shall promptly transfer a copy of any valid Asset Transfer Notice that it receives to the Issuer and the Principal Agent. Upon receipt of any Note deposited in connection with the delivery of any Entitlement as to a Physical Delivery Note, the Paying Agent or Transfer Agent with which such Bearer Note or Registered Certificate is deposited shall hold such Bearer Note (together with any Coupons, if any, relating to it and deposited with it) or Registered Certificate on behalf of the depositing Noteholder of such Bearer Note or Registered Certificate (but shall not, except as provided below, release it) until the due date for delivery of the applicable Entitlement of the relevant Note, when, subject as provided below and Clause 9(12) above, it shall present such Bearer Note (and any such Coupons, if any) or Registered Certificate, together with the serial numbers of the applicable Bearer Notes or Registered Certificates, to itself, the Issuer and the Delivery Agent for delivery of the Entitlement due thereon in accordance with the Terms and Conditions. If, prior to such due date for delivery, such Note becomes immediately due and payable or if upon due presentation, delivery or payment of the Entitlement or any monies is improperly withheld or refused, the Paying Agent shall post such Bearer Note (together with any such Coupons, if any) or Registered Certificate by uninsured post to, and at the risk of, the relevant Noteholder of such Note unless such Noteholder has otherwise requested and paid the costs of such insurance to the relevant Paying Agent at the time of depositing the Bearer Notes or Registered Certificate at such address outside the United States and its possessions as may have been given by such Noteholder in the Asset Transfer Notice.
(7) The Principal Agent shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event not later than 3:00 p.m. (local time) on the following Business Day on which a duly completed Asset Transfer Notice is delivered to it), notify the Issuer, the Calculation Agent (if applicable), and the Delivery Agent (if applicable) of details of the Notes in respect of which an Asset Transfer Notice has been delivered by any holder of Notes (such notification to
 
be in such form and in such manner as the Issuer, the relevant Dealer, the Calculation Agent (if applicable), and the Delivery Agent (if applicable) may reasonably request from time to time).
(8) The Principal Agent shall keep a full and complete record of all Notes and of their exercise, redemption and cancellation in accordance with this Clause 12 and make such records available at all reasonable times to the Issuer and any persons authorized by it for inspection and for the taking of copies thereof or extracts therefrom.
(9) The Principal Agent shall, as soon as practicable after the date on which all the Notes represented by any Bearer Global Note or by any Registered Global Certificate have been redeemed or have become null and void and upon delivery by or on behalf of the common depositary (in the case of a Global Note issued in CGN form or a Registered Global Certificate issued under the CSS) or the common safekeeper (in the case of a Bearer Global Note issued in NGN form or a Registered Global Certificate issued under the NSS) of the relevant Bearer Global Note or Registered Global Certificate to the Principal Agent, cancel the relevant Bearer Global Note or Registered Global Certificate or cause it to be cancelled and thereafter, unless otherwise instructed by the Issuer, destroy the relevant Bearer Global Note or Registered Global Certificate and upon written request by the Issuer certify such destruction to the Issuer.
13.
Receipt and Publication of Notices
(1) Upon the receipt by the Principal Agent of a demand or notice from any Noteholder in accordance with the Terms and Conditions, the Principal Agent shall forward a copy thereof to the Issuer.
(2) On behalf of and at the request and expense of the Issuer, the Principal Agent shall cause to be published all notices required to be given by the Issuer to the Noteholders in accordance with the Terms and Conditions.
(3) The Principal Agent shall have no responsibility to obtain the certificate of the Issuer delivered by the Issuer to the Principal Agent pursuant to Condition 6 if such a certificate is required to be issued, nor shall the Principal Agent have any responsibility to notify the Issuer if such a certificate is required to be issued.
14.
Cancellation of Notes, Receipts, Coupons and Talons
(1) All Bearer Notes which are purchased or redeemed, all Receipts or Coupons which are paid, all Talons which are exchanged, and all Registered Certificates representing Registered Notes that are purchased or redeemed, shall be delivered outside the United States and its possessions to the Principal Agent or Transfer Agent, as applicable, and shall be cancelled by the Principal Agent or Transfer Agent through which they are redeemed, paid or exchanged. In addition, the Issuer shall notify the Principal Agent or Transfer Agent, as applicable, in writing of all Notes which are purchased by or on behalf of the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries and all such Notes (or Registered Certificates in respect of Registered Notes) surrendered to the Principal Agent for cancellation, together (in the case of Bearer Definitive Notes) with all unmatured Receipts, Coupons or Talons (if any) attached thereto or surrendered therewith, shall be cancelled by the Principal Agent.

This Global Note is a Temporary Global Note in bearer form without interest coupons in respect of a duly authorized Series of Euro Medium-Term Notes (the "Notes") of Bank of America Corporation (the "Issuer") described, and having the provisions specified, in the applicable Final Terms (the "Final Terms"), which provisions are incorporated herein. References herein to the Terms and Conditions shall be to the Terms and Conditions of the Notes as set out in Schedules 6-1 and 6-2 to the Agency Agreement (as defined below) as modified and supplemented by the information set out in the Final Terms and which are incorporated herein by reference, but in the event of any conflict between the provisions of those Schedules and the information set out in the Final Terms, the Final Terms will prevail.
Words and expressions defined or set out in the Terms and Conditions and/or the Final Terms shall bear the same meaning when used herein.
This Global Note is issued subject to, and with the benefit of, the Terms and Conditions and an Amended and Restated Agency Agreement (the "Agency Agreement," which expression shall be construed as a reference to that agreement as the same may be amended, revised and/or supplemented from time to time) dated as of July 22, 2010, and made among Bank of America Corporation, Bank of America, N.A., London Branch (the "Principal Agent"), and Merrill Lynch International Bank Limited (the "Transfer Agent" and "Registrar" in respect of Registered Notes).
For value received, the Issuer, subject to and in accordance with the Terms and Conditions, promises to pay to the bearer hereof on each Installment Date the amount payable on such Installment Date in respect of the Notes represented by this Global Note (if the Notes represented by this Global Note are Installment Notes) and on the Maturity Date, on the Interest Payment Date, or on the Delivery Date, as the case may be, or on such earlier date as any of the Notes represented by this Global Note may become due and payable in accordance with the Terms and Conditions, the amount payable or deliverable, as the case may be, on redemption of such Notes then represented by this Global Note becoming so due and payable, and to pay interest (if any) or to deliver any Entitlement (if any) on the Notes from time to time represented by this Global Note calculated and payable as provided in the Terms and Conditions together with any other sums payable under the Terms and Conditions, upon presentation and following the delivery of an Asset Transfer Notice (in the case of Physical Delivery Notes) as provided in the Agency Agreement, and, at maturity, surrender of this Global Note to or to the order of the Principal Agent or any of the other paying agents located outside the United States and its possessions (except as provided in the Terms and Conditions) from time to time appointed by the Issuer in respect of the Notes, but in each case subject to the requirements as to certification provided herein.
If the applicable Final Terms indicate that this Global Note is intended to be a New Global Note, the nominal amount of Notes represented by this Global Note shall be the aggregate amount from time to time entered in the records of both Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. ("Euroclear") and Clearstream Banking, socit anonyme ("Clearstream, Luxembourg" and, together with Euroclear, the "Relevant Clearing Systems"). The records of the Relevant Clearing Systems (which expression in this Global Note means the records that each Relevant Clearing System holds for its customers which reflect the amount of such customer's interest in the Notes) shall be conclusive evidence of the nominal amount of Notes represented by this Global Note and, for these purposes, a statement issued by a Relevant Clearing System (which statement shall be made available to the bearer upon request) stating the nominal amount of Notes represented by this Global Note at any time shall be conclusive evidence of the records of the Relevant Clearing System at that time.
 
If the applicable Final Terms indicate that this Global Note is intended to be a Classic Global Note, the nominal amount of the Notes represented by this Global Note shall be the amount stated in the applicable Final Terms or, if lower, the nominal amount most recently recorded by or on behalf of the Issuer, in the relevant column in Part II, III or IV of Schedule 1 or in Schedule 2.
On any redemption, payment of an Installment Amount, delivery or purchase and cancellation of any of the Notes represented by this Global Note, the Issuer shall procure that:
(a) if the applicable Final Terms indicate that this Global Note is intended to be a New Global Note, details of such redemption, payment, delivery or purchase and cancellation (as the case may be) shall be entered pro rata in the records of the Relevant Clearing Systems and, upon any such entry being made, the nominal amount of the Notes recorded in the records of the Relevant Clearing Systems and represented by this Global Note shall be reduced by the principal amount of the Notes so redeemed or purchased and cancelled or by the amount of such installment so paid; or
(b) if the applicable Final Terms indicate that this Global Note is intended to be a Classic Global Note, details of such redemption, payment, delivery or purchase and cancellation (as the case may be) shall be entered in the relevant column in Part II, III or IV of Schedule 1 or Schedule 2 hereto recording any such redemption, payment, delivery or purchase and cancellation (as the case may be) and shall be signed by or on behalf of the Issuer. Upon any such redemption, payment of an Installment Amount, delivery or purchase and cancellation, the principal amount of such Notes represented by this Global Note shall be reduced by the principal amount of the Notes so redeemed or purchased and cancelled.
Prior to the Exchange Date (as defined below), all payments (if any) on this Global Note will only be made to the bearer hereof to the extent that there is presented to the Principal Agent by Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear a certificate, substantially in the form set out in Schedule 7 to the Agency Agreement, to the effect that it has received from or in respect of a person entitled to a particular principal amount of the Notes (as shown by its records) a certificate in or substantially in the form of the certificate as set out in Schedule 8 to the Agency Agreement. Payments or deliveries due in respect of Notes for the time being represented by this Global Note shall be made to the bearer of this Global Note and each payment so made will discharge the Issuer's obligations in respect thereof. Any failure to make the entries referred to in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall not affect such discharge. After the Exchange Date, the bearer of this Global Note will not be entitled to receive any payment of interest hereon.
On or after the Exchange Date (as defined below) this Global Note may be exchanged in whole or in part (free of charge) for, as specified in the Final Terms, either (a) if the applicable Final Terms indicate that this Global Note is intended to be a New Global Note, interests recorded in the records of the Relevant Clearing Systems in a Bearer Permanent Global Note or, if the applicable Final Terms indicate that this Global Note is intended to be a Classic Global Note, a Bearer Permanent Global Note, which, in either case, is in or substantially in the form set out in Schedule 2 to the Agency Agreement (together with the Final Terms attached to it), in each case upon notice being given by a Relevant Clearing System acting on the instructions of any holder of an interest in this Global Note or, (b) under certain limited circumstances, security printed Definitive Notes and, (if applicable) Coupons, Receipts and/or Talons in the form set out in Parts I, II, III, and IV respectively of Schedule 3 to the Agency Agreement (on the basis that all the appropriate details have been included on the face of such Definitive Notes and (if applicable) Coupons, Receipts and/or Talons and the Final Terms have been incorporated on such Definitive Notes) and subject to such notice period as is specified in the Final Terms. The "Exchange Date" for this Global Note will normally be the 40th calendar day after the later of the date on which the Issuer receives the proceeds of the sale of the Global Note and the closing date for the Global Note. However, if the Issuer, a Dealer or any distributor, as defined in Treasury Regulation Sec. 1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(D)(4), holds a Note represented by this Global Note as part of an unsold allotment or subscription for more than 40 calendar days after the later of the date on which the Issuer receives the proceeds of the sale of the Global Note and the closing date for the Global Note, the Exchange Date with respect to such Note will be the day after the date on which the Issuer, Dealer or distributor sells such Note.
 
This Global Note may be exchanged by the bearer hereof on any day (other than a Saturday or Sunday) on which banks are open for business in London. The Issuer shall procure that Definitive Notes and interests in the Bearer Permanent Global Note shall be so issued and delivered and (in the case of the Bearer Permanent Global Note where the applicable Final Terms indicate that this Global Note is intended to be a New Global Note) recorded in the records of the Relevant Clearing System in exchange for only that portion of this Global Note in respect of which there shall have been presented to the Principal Agent by Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg a certificate, substantially in the form set out in Schedule 7 to the Agency Agreement, to the effect that it has received from or in respect of a person entitled to a beneficial interest in a particular principal amount of the Notes (as shown by its records) a certificate from such person in or substantially in the form of the certificate set out in Schedule 8 to the Agency Agreement, unless such certificate has already been given in accordance with the above provisions. The aggregate principal amount of interests in a Bearer Permanent Global Note issued upon an exchange of this Global Note subject to the terms hereof, will be equal to the aggregate principal amount of this Global Note submitted by the bearer hereof for exchange (to the extent that such principal amount does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of this Global Note).
On an exchange of the whole of this Global Note, this Global Note shall be surrendered to the Principal Agent. On an exchange of only part of this Global Note, the Issuer shall procure that:
(a) if the applicable Final Terms indicate that this Global Note is intended to be a New Global Note, details of such exchange shall be entered pro rata in the records of the Relevant Clearing Systems; or
(b) if the applicable Final Terms indicate that this Global Note is intended to be a Classic Global Note, details of such exchange shall be entered in the relevant space in Schedule 2 hereto recording such exchange and shall be signed by or on behalf of the Issuer and the principal amount of this Global Note and the Notes represented by this Global Note shall be reduced by the principal amount so exchanged.
If, following the issue of a Bearer Permanent Global Note in exchange for some of the Notes represented by this Global Note, further Notes represented by this Global Note are to be exchanged for interests in a Bearer Permanent Global Note, such exchange may be effected, subject as provided herein, without the issue of a new Bearer Permanent Global Note, (i) if the applicable Final Terms indicate that this Global Note is intended to be a New Global Note, recording the details of such increase in the records of the Relevant Clearing Systems, or (ii) if the applicable Final Terms indicate that this Global Note is not intended to be a New Global Note, by the Issuer or its agent endorsing Schedule 2 of the Bearer Permanent Global Note previously issued to reflect an increase in the aggregate principal amount of such Bearer Permanent Global Note by an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Bearer Permanent Global Note which would otherwise have been issued on such exchange.
Until the exchange of the whole of this Global Note as aforesaid, the bearer hereof shall in all respects (except as otherwise provided herein) be entitled to the same benefits as if such bearer were the bearer of Definitive Notes and (if applicable) Coupons, Receipts and/or Talons in the form set out in Parts I, II, III and Part IV, respectively, of Schedule 3 to the Agency Agreement.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Bearer Temporary Global Note, the Issuer irrevocably agrees, for the benefit of such Noteholders and their successors and assigns, that each Noteholder or its successors or assigns may file without the consent and to the exclusion of the bearer hereof, any claim, take any action or institute any proceeding to enforce, directly against the Issuer, the obligation of the Issuer hereunder to pay any amount due or to become due in respect of each Note represented by this Bearer Temporary Global Note which is credited to such Noteholder's securities account with Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg without the production of this Bearer Temporary Global Note; that the bearer hereof shall not theretofore have filed a claim, taken action or instituted proceedings to enforce the same in respect of such Note.
provided
Until exchanged in full for the Bearer Permanent Global Note, this Bearer Temporary Global Note in all respects shall be entitled to the same benefits under, and subject to the same terms and conditions of, the Agency Agreement as the Bearer Permanent Global Note authenticated and delivered thereunder, except that neither the Holder hereof nor the beneficial owners of this Bearer Temporary Global Note shall be entitled to receive payment hereon on or after the Exchange Date.
 
This Bearer Temporary Global Note shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, United States of America, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.
This Bearer Temporary Global Note shall not become valid or obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been duly signed by or on behalf of the Principal Agent acting in accordance with the Agency Agreement. If the applicable Final Terms indicate that this Global Note is intended to be held in a manner which would allow Eurosystem eligibility, this Global Note shall not become valid or obligatory for any purpose until it is duly effectuated by the entity appointed as common safekeeper by the Relevant Clearing Systems.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF the Issuer has caused this Bearer Temporary Global Note to be duly signed on its behalf.
 
This Bearer Temporary Global Note is authenticated by or on behalf of the Principal Agent.
 
This Bearer Temporary Global Note is effectuated by or on behalf of the common safekeeper.

The Issuer and any Paying Agent may (except as otherwise required by law) deem and treat the bearer of any Bearer Note, Receipt, or Coupon as the absolute owner thereof (whether or not overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing thereon or notice of any previous loss or theft thereof) for all purposes but, in the case of any Bearer Global Note, without prejudice to the provisions set out in the next paragraph.
Register
So long as any of the Notes are represented by a Bearer Global Note or a Registered Global Certificate held on behalf of the Relevant Clearing System, each person who is shown in the records of the Relevant Clearing System as the holder of a particular nominal amount of such Notes (any certificate or other document issued by the Relevant Clearing System as to the nominal amount of Notes standing on the account of any person shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, except in the case of manifest error) shall be treated by the Issuer, the Principal Agent, the Registrar, any Transfer Agent, and any other Paying Agent as the holder of such nominal amount of such Notes for all purposes, except with respect to the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest, or any other amounts payable on, or deliveries in respect of, the Notes, the bearer of the relevant Bearer Global Note or, in the case of a Registered Global Note, the person or persons for the time being shown in the Register as at the Record Date maintained by the Registrar as the Noteholder or Noteholders, shall be treated by the Issuer, the Principal Agent, and any Paying Agent as the holder of such Notes in accordance with and subject to the terms of the relevant Global Note (and the expressions "" and "" and related expressions shall be construed accordingly).

In the case of a partial exercise of an option resulting in Registered Notes of the same holding having different terms, separate Registered Certificates shall be issued in respect of those Notes of that holding that have the same terms. New Registered Certificates shall only be issued against surrender of the existing certificates to the Registrar or any Transfer Agent. In the case of a transfer of Registered Notes to a person who is already a holder of Registered Notes, a new Registered Certificate representing the enlarged holding shall only be issued against surrender of the Registered Certificate representing the existing holding.
 
Each Registered Certificate to be issued pursuant to Condition 2(b) or (c) shall be available for delivery within three business days after receipt of the request for exchange, form of transfer or Put Notice (as defined herein) or surrender of the Registered Certificate for exchange, as applicable.

Under the Program, there is no limitation on the Issuer's ability to issue additional Senior Indebtedness (as defined below) or Subordinated Notes.
 
The Senior Notes will be unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer and will rank equally with all other unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer. The Subordinated Notes are unsecured and subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer.
"" is defined as any indebtedness for money borrowed (including all indebtedness of the Issuer for borrowed and purchased money of the Issuer, all obligations arising from off-balance sheet guarantees by the Issuer and direct credit substitutes and obligations of the Issuer associated with derivative products such as interest and foreign exchange rate contracts and commodity contracts) that is outstanding on the date of execution of the Agency Agreement, or is thereafter created, incurred, or assumed, for which the Issuer is at the time of determination responsible or liable as obligor, guarantor, or otherwise for payment, and all deferrals, renewals, extensions, and refundings of any such indebtedness or obligations, other than the Subordinated Notes or any other indebtedness as to which the instrument creating or evidencing the same or pursuant to which the same is outstanding, provides that such indebtedness is subordinate in right of payment to any other indebtedness of the Issuer.
Senior Indebtedness
 
The indebtedness evidenced by the Subordinated Notes and any Coupons and Receipts appertaining thereto, subject to the extent set forth herein, shall be subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all the Issuer's Senior Indebtedness.

There is no right of acceleration in the case of a default in the payment of interest on the Subordinated Notes or in the performance of any other obligation of the Issuer under the Subordinated Notes.
The Issuer shall not make any payment on account of principal of, premium, if any, interest, or any other amounts payable on, or deliveries in respect of, its Subordinated Notes or purchase any of its Subordinated Notes, either directly or indirectly, if (1) any default or Event of Default with respect to any of its Senior Indebtedness shall have occurred and be continuing and (2) it shall have received written notice thereof from the holders of at least 10.00 per cent. in principal amount of any kind or category of any of its Senior Indebtedness (or the representative or representatives of such holders).
Until all of the Issuer's Senior Indebtedness is paid in full, the holders of the Subordinated Notes will be subrogated (equally and ratably with the holders of all of the Issuer's indebtedness which, by its express terms, ranks equally with its Subordinated Notes, and is entitled to like rights of subrogation) to the rights of the holders of the Issuer's Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of its assets.
If the Issuer repays any of its Subordinated Notes before the required date or in connection with a distribution of its assets to creditors pursuant to a dissolution, winding up, liquidation, or reorganization, any principal, premium, if any, interest, or any other amounts payable or deliveries due will be paid or delivered to the holders of the Issuer's Senior Indebtedness before any holders of its Subordinated Notes are paid. In addition, if such amounts were previously paid to the holders of the
 
Subordinated Notes, the holders of its Senior Indebtedness shall have first rights to such amounts previously paid.
No modification or amendment of the subordination provisions of Subordinated Notes and any related coupons in a manner adverse to the holders of Senior Indebtedness may be made without the consent of the holders of all of the Issuer's outstanding Senior Indebtedness.

The limit may not apply to Notes in which $2,500,000 or more has been invested.
 
For the purposes of this Condition 5, references to payment or repayment (as the case may be) of principal and/or interest and other similar expressions shall, where the context so requires, be deemed also to refer to delivery of any Entitlement.
 
Payments of principal and interest in respect of Bearer Notes shall be made against presentation and surrender of the relevant Receipts (in the case of payments of Installment Amounts other than on the due date for redemption and provided that the Receipt is presented for payment together with its related Note), Notes or Coupons, as the case may be, at the specified office of any Paying Agent outside the United States and its possessions by a check payable in the currency in which such payment is due drawn on a bank in the Principal Financial Center for that currency, and at the option of the bearer of such Receipt, Note, or Coupon, shall be mailed or delivered to an address outside the United States and its possessions furnished by such bearer or, at the option of such bearer, subject to any applicable laws and regulations, shall be transferred to an account denominated in that currency with a bank in the Principal Financial Center for that currency; provided, however, that any payments made by transfer will be made in immediately available funds to an account maintained by the payee with a bank located outside the United States and its possessions, provided, however that:

Notwithstanding Condition 5(a), U.S. Dollar payments of principal and interest in respect of Bearer Notes will be made at the specified office of a Paying Agent in the United States or its possessions if:
 
 
 
 
In the case of Fixed-Rate Notes, Bearer Notes should be presented for payment together with all related unmatured Coupons (which expression shall for this purpose include Coupons to be issued upon exchange of matured Talons). Failure to present the above will result in the amount of any missing unmatured Coupon (or, in the case of payment not being made in full, the same proportion of the amount of such missing unmatured Coupon as the sum so paid bears to the sum due) being deducted from the sum due for payment. Each amount of principal so deducted will be paid as described above against surrender of the relative missing Coupon at any time before the expiration of five years after the Relevant Date (as defined in Condition 9) in respect of such principal (whether or not such Coupon would otherwise have become void under Condition 9) or, if later, five years from the date on which such Coupon would otherwise have become due. Upon any Bearer Note becoming due and payable prior to its Maturity Date, all relevant unmatured Talons, if any, will become void and no further Coupons will be issued in respect of that Bearer Note.
In the case of Floating-Rate Notes, upon any Bearer Note becoming due and payable prior to its Maturity Date, any related unmatured Coupons (whether or not attached), shall become void and no payment or, as the case may be, exchange for further Coupons, shall be made in respect of those Bearer Notes.
Upon the date on which any Bearer Note becomes due and repayable, unmatured Receipts, if any, relating thereto (whether or not attached), shall become void and no payment shall be made in respect thereof. Payment of the final installment will be made as provided in Condition 5(a) above against surrender of the relevant Bearer Notes.
If the due date for redemption of any Bearer Note is not a Fixed Interest Payment Date or an Interest Payment Date, interest, if any, accrued in respect of such Bearer Note, from (and including) the
 
preceding Fixed Interest Payment Date or Interest Payment Date or, as the case may be, the Interest Commencement Date, shall be payable only against surrender of the relevant Bearer Note.
Except as provided in Condition 5(c), payments of principal, premium, if any, interest, or any other amounts payable on, or deliveries in respect of, a Bearer Global Note, will be made as specified above for Bearer Notes and otherwise as specified in the relevant Bearer Global Note outside the United States and its possessions against presentation or surrender, as the case may be, of such Bearer Global Note, and payments on any Bearer Note will be made at the specified office of any Paying Agent outside the United States and its possessions. The Paying Agent will record on each Bearer Global Note in CGN form each payment made against presentation or surrender of such Bearer Global Note, distinguishing between any payment of principal, premium, if any, interest, or any other amounts payable, and such record shall be prima facie evidence that the payment has been made.
So long as any of the Notes are represented by a Bearer Global Note or a Registered Global Certificate held on behalf of the Relevant Clearing System, each person who is shown in the records of the Relevant Clearing System as the holder of a particular nominal amount of such Notes (any certificate or other document issued by the Relevant Clearing System as to the nominal amount of Notes standing on the account of any person shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, except in the case of manifest error) shall be treated by the Issuer, the Principal Agent, and any other Paying Agent as the holder of such nominal amount of such Notes for all purposes, except with respect to the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest, or any other amounts payable on, or deliveries in respect of, the Notes, the bearer of the relevant Bearer Global Note or, in the case of a Registered Global Note, the person or persons for the time being shown in the Register maintained by the Registrar as the Noteholder or Noteholders, shall be treated by the Issuer, the Principal Agent, and any Paying Agent as the holder of such Notes in accordance with and subject to the terms of the relevant Global Note.
 
If the due date for payment of any amount in respect of any Note, Receipt, or Coupon is not a Payment Business Day, the holder of the Notes shall not be entitled to payment of the amount due until (i) if "Following" is specified in the applicable Final Terms, the next following Payment Business Day or (ii), if "Modified Following" is specified in the applicable Final Terms, the next following Payment Business Day unless that Payment Business Day falls in the next calendar month, in which case the first preceding Payment Business Day.

The Principal Agent, on receipt of the Issuer's written instruction and at the expense of the Issuer, shall give prompt notice to the holders of the Notes if such determination is made. The amount of U.S. Dollars to be paid in connection with any payment shall be the amount of U.S. Dollars that could be purchased by the Agent with the amount of the relevant currency payable on the date the payment is due, at the rate for sale in financial transactions of U.S. Dollars (for delivery in the Principal Financial Center of the Specified Currency two Business Days later) quoted by that bank at 10:00 a.m. local time in the Principal Financial Center of the relevant currency, on the second Business Day prior to the date the payment is due.
 
For the purposes of any calculations required pursuant to these Conditions (unless otherwise specified elsewhere in these Conditions or in the relevant Final Terms), (x) all percentages resulting from such calculations shall be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point (with halves being rounded up), (y) all figures shall be rounded to seven significant figures (with halves being rounded up) and (z) all currency amounts that fall due and payable shall be rounded to the nearest sub-unit of such currency (with halves being rounded up), except in the case of Japanese yen, which shall be rounded down to the nearest Japanese yen.
 
 
If the applicable Final Terms specifies "Payment Disruption Event" to be applicable, then, in the event that the Calculation Agent, at any time and from time to time, determines in its sole discretion that a Payment Disruption Event has occurred or is likely to occur, then the Calculation Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the
 
Noteholders of the relevant Notes of the occurrence of a Payment Disruption Event in accordance with Condition 14.

The Issuer's obligation to pay the Interest Amount, Fixed Coupon Amount, Final Redemption Amount or any such other amounts in respect of the relevant Notes shall, subject to Condition 5(i)(ii)(D), be postponed until five Business Days (or such other date as may be determined by the Calculation Agent and notified to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 14) after the date on which the Payment Disruption Event is no longer operating. Noteholders shall not be entitled to further interest or other payment in respect of such postponement.
 
Notwithstanding the Issuer's right to postpone payment in accordance with Condition 5(i)(ii)(A), the Issuer may, if practicable (and to the extent lawful), and at the Issuer's sole and absolute discretion:
 
 
 
 
Any payments or deliveries made in accordance with this Condition 5(i)(ii)(B) shall satisfy and discharge in full (in the case of payments or deliveries made in accordance with paragraphs (1) to (3)) and in part (in the case of Partial Distributions made in accordance with paragraph (4)) the Issuer's obligation to pay the Interest Amount, Fixed Coupon Amount, Final Redemption Amount or other amount in respect of which the Payment Disruption Event has arisen, and no further amounts shall be due and payable by the Issuer in respect thereof.
 
Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary, (a) any payments made in accordance with this Condition 5(i) shall be made after deduction of any costs,
 
expenses or liabilities incurred or to be incurred by the Calculation Agent or Issuer in connection with or arising from the resolution of the relevant Payment Disruption Event(s) and (b) no interest shall be paid by the Issuer in respect of any delay which may occur in the payment of any amounts due and payable under the Notes as a result of the operation of this Condition 5(i)(ii).
 
In the event that a Payment Disruption Event is still occurring on the Payment Event Cut-Off Date, the Interest Payment Date, the Maturity Date, or any other date on which redemption amounts in relation to any of the Notes shall be due and payable (as the case may be) for the relevant Notes shall fall on the Payment Event Cut-Off Date.

(c) the total number and (in the case only of Bearer Definitive Notes) the serial numbers of the Bearer Notes so deposited or held are listed distinguishing with regard to each such resolution between those in respect of which instructions have been so given that the votes attributable thereto should be cast against the resolution; and

The holder of any voting certificate or the Proxies named in any block voting instruction shall for all purposes in connection with the relevant meeting or adjourned meeting of Noteholders be deemed to be the holder of the Bearer Notes to which such voting certificate or block voting instruction related and the Paying Agent with which such Bearer Notes have been deposited or the person holding the same to the order or under the control of such Paying Agent shall be deemed for such purposes not to be the holder of those Notes.
(iii) References herein to the "Notes" are to the Notes in respect of which the relevant meeting is convened.
2. A holder of a Registered Note may, by an instrument in writing in the form available from the specified office of a Transfer Agent in the English language executed by or on behalf of the holder and delivered to the Transfer Agent at least 24 hours before the time fixed for a meeting, appoint a Proxy to act on such holders' behalf in connection with that meeting.

A copy of the notice shall be sent by post to the Issuer (unless the meeting is convened by the Issuer).
5. In case at any time the Issuer or the holders of at least 33% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding shall have requested the Principal Agent to call a meeting of Noteholders, by written request setting forth in reasonable detail the action proposed to be taken at the meeting, and the Principal Agent shall not have given the first notice of such meeting within 21 calendar days after receipt of such request or shall not thereafter proceed to cause the meeting to be held as provided herein, then the Issuer or Noteholders of Notes in the amount above specified may determine the time and the place in either of the locations designated in paragraph 3 hereof for such meeting and may call such meeting by giving notice thereof as provided in paragraph 4 hereof.

Notice of the reconvening of any adjourned meeting shall be given as provided in paragraph 4 hereof except that such notice need be published only once but must be given not less than five calendar days prior to the date on which the meeting is scheduled to be reconvened. Subject to the foregoing, at the reconvening of any meeting adjourned for a lack of a quorum the persons entitled to vote 33% in principal amount of the Notes shall constitute a quorum for the taking of any action set forth in the notice of the original meeting. Notice of the reconvening of an adjourned meeting shall state expressly the percentage of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that shall constitute a quorum.

Any Noteholder who has
 
executed and delivered an instrument in writing appointing a person as his Proxy shall be deemed to be present for the purposes of determining a quorum and be deemed to have voted; , , that such Noteholder shall be considered as present or voting only with respect to the matters covered by such instrument in writing. Any resolution effectively passed or decision taken at any meeting of the Noteholders duly held in accordance with this paragraph 8 shall be binding on all Noteholders whether or not present or represented at the meeting and whether or not notation of such decision is made upon the Notes.
provided
however
9. Notice of any adjourned meeting at which an Extraordinary Resolution is to be submitted shall be given in the same manner as notice of an original meeting but as if 10 were substituted for 21 in paragraph 4 above and such notice shall (except in cases where the proviso to paragraph 6 above shall apply when it shall state the relevant quorum) state that one or more persons present holding Notes or voting certificates or being Proxies at the adjournment meeting whatever the principal amount of the Notes held or represented by them will form a quorum. Subject as aforesaid it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjourned meeting.
10. Every question submitted to a meeting shall be decided in the first instance by a show of hands and in case of equality of votes the Chairman shall both on a show of hands and on a poll have a casting vote in addition to the vote or votes (if any) to which he may be entitled as a Noteholder or as a holder of a voting certificate or as a Proxy.
11. At any meeting, unless a poll is (before or on the declaration of the results of the show of hands) demanded by the Chairman or the Issuer or by one or more persons present holding Notes or voting certificates or being Proxies and holding or representing in the aggregate not less than two percent in principal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding, a declaration by the Chairman that a resolution has been carried or carried by a particular majority or lost or not carried by a particular majority shall be conclusive evidence of the fact without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favor of or against such resolution.
12. Subject to paragraph 14 below, if at any such meeting a poll is so demanded it shall be taken in such manner and subject as hereinafter provided either at once or after an adjournment as the Chairman directs and the result of such poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded as at the date of the asking of the poll. The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of the meeting for the transaction of any business other than the motion on which the poll has been demanded.
13. The Chairman may with the consent of (and shall if directed by) any such meeting adjourn the same from time to time and from place to place but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting except business which might lawfully (but for lack of required quorum) have been transacted at the meeting from which the adjournment took place.
14. Any poll demanded at any such meeting on the election of a Chairman or on any question of adjournment shall be taken at the meeting without adjournment.
15. Any director or officer of the Issuer and its lawyers and other professional advisers may attend and speak at any meeting. Save as aforesaid, but without prejudice to the proviso to the definition of "outstanding" in sub-clause 1(b) of the Agency Agreement, no person shall be entitled to attend and speak nor shall any person be entitled to vote at any meeting of the Noteholders or join with others in requisitioning the convening of such a meeting unless he either produces the Note or Notes of which he is the holder or a voting certificate or is a Proxy. Neither the Issuer nor any of its subsidiaries shall be entitled to vote at any meeting in respect of Notes held by it for the benefit of any such company and no other person shall be entitled to vote at any meeting in respect of Notes held by it for the benefit of any such company. Nothing herein contained shall prevent any of the Proxies named in any block voting instruction from being a director, officer or representative of or otherwise connected with the Issuer.
16. Subject as provided in paragraph 15 hereof at any meeting:
(A) on a show of hands every person who is present in person and produces a Note or voting certificate or is a Proxy shall have one vote; and
 
(B) on a poll every person who is so present shall have one vote in respect of:

Without prejudice to the obligation of the Proxies named in any block voting instructions, any person entitled to more than one vote need not use all his votes or cast all the votes to which he is entitled in the same way.
17. Each block voting instruction together (if so requested by the Issuer) with proof satisfactory to the Issuer of its due execution on behalf of the relevant Paying Agent shall be deposited at such place as the Principal Agent shall approve not less than 24 hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the Proxies named in the block voting instruction propose to vote and in default the block voting instruction shall not be treated as valid unless the Chairman of the meeting decides otherwise before such meeting or adjourned meeting proceeds to business. A certified copy of each block voting instruction shall be deposited with the Principal Agent before the commencement of the meeting or adjourned meeting, but the Principal Agent shall not thereby be obliged to investigate or be concerned with the validity of or the authority of the Proxies named in any such block voting instruction.
18. Any vote given in accordance with the terms of a block voting instruction shall be valid notwithstanding the previous revocation or amendment of the block voting instruction or of any of the Noteholders' instructions pursuant to which it was executed, no intimation in writing of such revocation or amendment shall have been received from the relevant Paying Agent by the Issuer at its registered office (or such other place as may have been approved by the Principal Agent of the purpose) by the time being 24 hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the block voting instruction is to be used.
