CHARLOTTE  Bank of America Corporation today reported a net loss of $7.3 billion, or $0.77 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2010, including a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of $10.4 billion. Excluding this charge, net income was $3.1 billion, or $0.27 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $1.0 billion, or $0.26 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2009.
About the Goodwill Impairment Charge
As previously announced, the goodwill impairment charge is a non-cash, non-tax deductible charge applicable to the Global Card Services segment. The goodwill impairment charge does not impact regulatory capital or tangible equity ratios or liquidity, and has no impact on the company's ability to serve its customers and clients around the world.

Page 2
 
The charge results from the limits to be placed on debit interchange fees under the financial reform legislation enacted in July 2010, which will reduce future revenues in the Global Card Services business.
New Consumer Bank Strategy
As a result of the legislation and other changes in the environment, the company is changing the way its consumer bank does business, focusing on a relationship enhancement strategy designed to incent customers to bring more business and to make pricing more upfront and transparent. This change moves away from a dependence on penalty fees, which the industry had adopted over the years, and provides the customer with a better banking experience. These changes are expected to result in additional revenue.
Bank of America has begun to introduce new customer solutions designed to meet these goals. In August, the company began offering eBanking, which allows customers who primarily use such alternative channels as online banking and ATMs, to be rewarded with better pricing. The bank plans to begin testing new offerings in December that will provide customers choices on how to pay for their banking services and reward them for using certain products or bringing more balances. The company is also considering other new products in the payments area that would meet the evolving needs of specific customer groups with testing scheduled to begin next year.
Operating Results
Third-quarter 2010 results compared to a year ago benefited from lower credit costs, higher net interest income due in part to the adoption of new consolidation guidance on January 1, 2010 and increases in other income, mortgage banking income and card income. These improvements were partially offset by lower service charges, lower trading account profits and a decrease in insurance income.
"Our results this quarter demonstrate continued traction with each customer group  consumers, businesses, and institutional investors," said President and Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan. "Our strategy is to leave nothing to chance in our goal of doing everything we can for each of our customers.
"We are adapting to the regulatory environment, credit quality continues to improve, and we are managing risk and building capital. We are realistic about the near-term challenges, and optimistic about the long-term opportunity."

Third-Quarter 2010 Financial Summary
Revenue and Expense
 
 
 
n/a = Not applicable
Revenue, net of interest expense, on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis rose 2 percent from the year-ago period. Net interest income on an FTE basis increased 8 percent from a year earlier, reflecting the impact of the adoption of new consolidation guidance, effective January 1, 2010, which added assets of approximately $100 billion to the balance sheet as of that date. The change, while having no impact on net income, primarily increased net interest income and card income offset by increased provision for credit losses.
Compared to the second quarter of 2010, revenue, net of interest expense, on an FTE basis was down 8 percent. Net interest income on an FTE basis was down 4 percent from the second quarter of 2010, reflecting lower loan levels and the impact of the extended low rate environment. The net interest yield widened 11 basis points from the year-ago quarter due primarily to the higher-yielding loans included on our balance sheet related to the adoption of the new consolidation guidance, partially offset by the impact of spread compression. Compared to the second quarter of 2010, the net interest yield decreased 5 basis points due mainly to a shift in the mix of earning assets as higher-yielding assets ran off and were replaced with lower-yielding assets available in the lower rate environment.

Noninterest income declined 2 percent from the year-ago quarter due primarily to lower service charges, reduced trading account profits and lower gains on sales of debt securities. Additionally, insurance income was lower compared to the same period a year ago as a result of a $592 million reserve related to payment protection insurance claims in the U.K. These factors were partially offset by year-over-year improvements in other income driven largely by lower losses of $190 million primarily related to structured liabilities, compared to losses of $1.8 billion in the year-ago period, higher mortgage banking income, and increases in card income.
Noninterest expense was up 67 percent from the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting the goodwill impairment charge. Excluding the goodwill impairment charge, noninterest expense was up 3 percent from a year ago due primarily to higher personnel costs, increased professional fees and litigation costs. Pretax merger and restructuring charges declined $173 million from a year earlier to $421 million.
Credit Quality
 
 
 
n/a = not applicable
Note: Ratios do not include loans measured under the fair value option.

Page 6
 
Credit quality continued to improve during the quarter, with net charge-offs continuing to decline in almost all portfolios. Credit costs, while still at elevated levels, fell for the fifth consecutive quarter. Additionally, delinquencies accruing past due 30 days or more, excluding FHA-insured loans, declined for the sixth consecutive quarter, and reservable criticized utilized levels decreased for the fourth consecutive quarter.
Net charge-offs were $2.4 billion lower than the second quarter of 2010, reflecting improvement in the consumer and commercial portfolios. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact of continued improvement in delinquencies in both the consumer credit card and real estate portfolios. The allowance to annualized net charge-off coverage ratio improved in the third quarter to 1.53 times, compared with 1.18 times in the second quarter of 2010 and 0.94 times in the third quarter of 2009. Excluding purchased credit-impaired loans, the allowance to annualized net charge-off coverage ratio was 1.34, 1.05 and 0.86 times, respectively. Nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties declined to $34.6 billion, compared with $35.6 billion at June 30, 2010 and $33.8 billion a year ago.
The provision for credit losses was $5.4 billion, $2.7 billion lower than the second quarter and $6.3 billion lower than the same period a year earlier. The provision was $1.8 billion lower than net charge-offs, resulting in a reduction in the allowance for loan and lease losses for the quarter. This compares with a $1.45 billion reduction in the second quarter and an addition of $2.1 billion a year earlier.
The reserve reduction in the third quarter was primarily due to improved delinquencies, collections and bankruptcies in the domestic credit card, small business and consumer lending businesses. Additionally, improving portfolio trends in consumer real estate products and reductions across the core commercial portfolio, reflecting stabilization of borrower credit profiles and economic conditions contributed to the reserve reduction. These were partially offset by reserve additions for certain purchased credit-impaired consumer portfolios obtained through acquisitions.

Capital and Liquidity Management
 
(Dollars in millions, except per share information)
 
 
 
Capital ratios strengthened from the second quarter of 2010 due to retained earnings and the sale of First Republic Bank. Additionally, the total capital ratio and tangible common equity ratio benefited from the mark-to-market after-tax adjustment in equity of $6.2 billion on the company's investment in China Construction Bank that is within a year of the expiration of sales restrictions. The company's liquidity position strengthened during the quarter as customers continued to reduce debt. The company's total global excess liquidity sources rose more than $30 billion from the second quarter of 2010 to $324 billion. At September 30, 2010, the company's time-to-required funding was 23 months.
During the quarter, a cash dividend of $0.01 per common share was paid, and the company declared $348 million in preferred dividends. Period-end common shares issued and outstanding were 10.03 billion for the second and third quarters of 2010 and 8.65 billion for the third quarter of 2009. The increase in outstanding shares year over year was driven primarily by the company's capital-raising initiative in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the related conversion of common equivalent shares into common stock in the first quarter of 2010.

Business Segment Results
Deposits
 
 
 
 
net income of $195 million declined $619 million from the year-ago period due to decreases in revenue and higher noninterest expense. The revenue decline was driven by the impact of Regulation E, which was effective beginning this quarter, and related overdraft policy changes implemented beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009. This was partially offset by disciplined pricing and a customer shift to more liquid products, which led to increased net interest income.
Deposits
Noninterest expense increased 18 percent from a year ago as a higher proportion of costs associated with banking center sales and service efforts were aligned to Deposits from the other consumer businesses.
Average deposits declined 2 percent from a year ago driven by the decline in higher-yielding former Countrywide deposits and the transfer of certain deposits to other client-managed businesses, partially offset by organic growth.

Global Card Services
 
 
 
 
reported a net loss of $9.9 billion due to the $10.4 billion goodwill impairment charge. Excluding this charge, Global Card Services would have reported net income of $529 million, compared to a net loss of $955 million a year ago.
Global Card Services
Revenue decreased $1.5 billion from a year ago, driven by lower average loans, reduced interest and fee income primarily resulting from the implementation of the CARD Act and the impact of recording a $592 million reserve related to future payment protection insurance claims in the U.K.
Provision for credit losses decreased $3.6 billion from a year ago driven by $3.2 billion lower charge-offs and reserve reductions due to lower delinquencies and decreasing bankruptcies as a result of the improved economic environment.
Noninterest expense increased compared to a year ago due to the goodwill impairment charge. Excluding this impairment charge, noninterest expense decreased 11 percent compared to the year-ago period as a higher proportion of

costs associated with banking center sales and service efforts were aligned to Deposits from Global Card Services.
Home Loans and Insurance
 
 
 
 
The net loss of $344 million in decreased $1.3 billion from the year-ago period. Revenue increased 10 percent largely due to higher mortgage banking income primarily driven by improved mortgage servicing rights results, net of hedges, and higher production income driven by wider production margins. These improvements were partially offset by a $417 million increase in representations and warranties expense.
Home Loans and Insurance
Provision for credit losses decreased $1.6 billion driven primarily by improving portfolio trends, which led to lower net charge-offs and reserve reductions compared to the reserve increases in the prior year. In addition, provision for credit losses benefited from a lower reserve addition in the Countrywide purchased credit-impaired home equity portfolio.
Noninterest expense was essentially flat from a year ago as lower production and insurance expenses were offset by higher costs related to the increase in default management staff and other loss mitigation activities.

Global Commercial Banking
 
 
 
 
net income increased $797 million from the year-ago loss of $160 million due to lower credit costs.
Global Commercial Banking
Revenue decreased $213 million from a year ago primarily due to a lower residual net interest income allocation related to asset and liability management activities and, to a lesser extent, declines in net interest income from lower average loan balances. These were partially offset by improved loan spreads on new, renewed and amended facilities. In addition, revenue was positively impacted by strong deposit growth as clients remained very liquid.
The provision for credit losses decreased $1.5 billion from a year ago driven by reserve reductions and lower net charge-offs in the commercial real estate portfolio, reflecting stabilization of appraised values primarily in the homebuilder portfolio and fewer single name charge-offs, combined with lower net charge-offs in the commercial domestic portfolio, reflecting improved borrower credit profiles.
Average loan and lease balances decreased $27.2 billion from a year ago due to client deleveraging and low new loan demand. Average deposit balances continued to grow, increasing by $17.0 billion, as clients managed to new liquidity levels.

Global Banking and Markets
 
 
 
 
net income decreased $794 million from strong year-ago levels, driven by reduced revenues, increased noninterest expense and higher income tax expense partially offset by lower credit costs.
Global Banking and Markets
Revenue decreased 7 percent from the year-ago period due to lower sales and trading revenues, partially offset by higher Investment Banking fees and revenues from Corporate Banking. Compared to the second quarter, revenue rose 20 percent due to an improved trading environment, primarily in Credit sales and trading.
Provision for credit losses declined $695 million from a year ago primarily driven by lower net charge-offs and reserve reductions in the corporate portfolio, reflecting improvement in borrower credit profiles and reduction in reservable criticized levels.
Noninterest expense increased $793 million driven by higher compensation costs, which reflects the year-over-year impact of changing compensation last year to deliver a greater portion of incentives over time and increases in other operating costs. Additionally, the most recent period was impacted by a $388 million charge related to the U.K. tax rate change, impacting the carrying value of the deferred tax asset.
Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities sales and trading revenue fell to $3.5 billion, compared to $4.0 billion a year ago, due to the relative changes in spreads over last year, mainly in Credit. Compared to the second quarter of 2010, Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities sales and trading revenue rose $1.2 billion due to spread tightening, increased customer activity and eased concerns from the European sovereign debt crisis.

Equities sales and trading revenue declined to $1.0 billion from $1.3 billion a year ago, driven primarily by a decrease in volumes as well as reductions in equity derivatives revenue. Compared to the second quarter of 2010, equities revenue rose $122 million primarily due to the rebound from adverse market conditions in the prior period.
Global Wealth and Investment Management
 
 
 
 
net income increased $79 million from a year earlier driven by lower credit costs and higher noninterest income, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.
Global Wealth and Investment Management
Revenue increased $200 million from a year earlier to $4.1 billion driven by higher asset management fees and the absence of support for certain cash funds in the prior year, partially offset by lower brokerage income.
The provision for credit losses decreased $387 million from a year ago to $128 million driven by lower reserve additions and net charge-offs in the consumer real estate and commercial portfolios, along with the absence of a prior-year single large commercial charge-off.
 
More
Page 14
 
Noninterest expense increased from a year ago due primarily to higher revenue-related expenses, personnel costs, higher litigation and support costs.
All Other
All Other reported net income of $323 million compared to a $1.5 billion net loss a year ago, as higher revenue reflected an increase in net interest income and negative fair value adjustments of $190 million related to structured liabilities, compared to negative fair value adjustments of $1.8 billion in the year-ago period. This was partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses.
The provision for credit losses increased from a year ago primarily due to the impact of the new consolidation guidance as the prior year period included a securitization offset to present Global Card Services on a managed basis. This was partially offset by reserve reductions to the residential mortgage portfolio due to improving portfolio trends as compared to reserve additions in the prior year. In addition, the provision benefited from a lower reserve addition in the Countrywide purchased credit-impaired discontinued real estate portfolio.
All Other consists primarily of equity investments, the residential mortgage portfolio associated with asset and liability management (ALM) activities, the residual impact of the cost allocation process, merger and restructuring charges, intersegment eliminations, fair value adjustments related to structured liabilities and the results of certain consumer finance, investment management and commercial lending businesses that are being liquidated. Prior to January 1, 2010, All Other also included the offsetting securitization impact to present Global Card Services on a managed basis.

Reconciliation to GAAP Financial Measures
 
(Dollars in millions shares in thousands)
The Corporation evaluates its business based upon a fully taxable-equivalent basis which is a non-GAAP measure. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to a fully taxable-equivalent basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The Corporation also evaluates its business based upon ratios that utilize tangible equity which is a non-GAAP measure. Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of common shareholders' equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of average shareholders' equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible common equity ratio represents common shareholders' equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible equity ratio represents total shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents ending common shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity (i.e., capital). In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders' equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. Also, the efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue. In addition, earnings and diluted earnings per common share, the efficiency ratio, return on average assets, return on average common shareholders' equity, return on average tangible common shareholders' equity and return on average tangible shareholders' equity have been calculated excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge of $10.4 billion taken during the third quarter of 2010. See below for Reconciliations of total noninterest expense, net income (loss) and net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders excluding the goodwill impairment charge to GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation.
Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. See the tables below for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the three months ended September 30, 2010, June 30, 2010, March 31, 2010, December 31, 2009 and September 30, 2009 and the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009.

Reconciliation - Managed to GAAP
 
(Dollars in millions)
In 2010, the Corporation reports results in accordance with new consolidation guidance. The 2009 periods are presented on a managed basis. Managed basis assumes that securitized loans were not sold and presents earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold (i.e., held loans) are presented. Loan securitization is an alternative funding process that is used by the Corporation to diversify funding sources. In prior periods, loan securitization removed loans from the Consolidated Balance Sheet through the sale of loans to an off-balance sheet qualifying special purpose entity which was excluded from the Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP applicable at the time.
Global Card Services
The performance of the managed portfolio is important in understanding results as it demonstrates the results of the entire portfolio serviced by the business. Securitized loans continue to be serviced by the business and are subject to the same underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring as held loans. In addition, excess servicing income is exposed to similar credit risk and repricing of interest rates as held loans. In prior periods, managed income statement line items differed from a held basis reported as follows:

Core NII
Market-based NII
NII on securitized card receivables
Managed net interest yield
Reported net interest yield
Net interest income was lower by $480M while the net interest yield fell 5 bps to 2.72%
Primary drivers of the decline in NII were
Sale of First Republic Bank reduced NII ($230M)
Reduced yields on the discretionary portfolio ($300M)
Lower consumer and commercial loan balances ($200M)
Partially offset by:
Improving credit and lower long-term debt balances ($250M)
Mitigation of NII pressure led by focus on reductions in long-term debt, which was reduced $11B from 2Q10 and we expect to reduce another 15-20% by end of 2011
We expect NII declines to continue over the next few quarters but level of declines should diminish as loans and yields begin to stabilize, combined with long-term debt reductions
1Fully taxable-equivalent basis.
2Periods prior to January 1, 2010 are presented on a managed basis and assumes that credit card loans that were securitized were not sold and presented earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold (i.e., held loans) were presented.

Service charges were down $364M vs. 2Q10 as a result of the implementation of Regulation E, partially offset by benefits of seasonality
Estimated 4Q10 service charges of roughly $2.0B, which is estimated to fully reflect Regulation E
Overall retail deposit balances, excluding deposits associated with the sale of First Republic Bank, grew slightly during the quarter as deposits with our affluent customers increased while other customer segments declined slightly
Customers continue to shift deposits to more liquid products
Despite the low interest rate environment, we continue to drive down our rate paid on retail deposits declined 5 bps to 41 bps in 3Q10
Checking sales were up 8% vs. 2Q10 driven by seasonality, and the mix of sales reflects an increasing majority of new accounts

Have made significant progress on Tier 1 Common and risk-weighted assets (RWA) year-to-date
 Tier 1 common capital up $14B, RWA down $87B and ratio up 137bp net of FAS 166/167 impacts
 Have been proactive in addressing Basel changes re-remic transactions, sales of Itau and SantanderMexico, reductions in private equity portfolio
 Risk-weighted asset reductions are consistent with customer-centric strategies we are pursuing
New rules being introduced Basel II, Basel III, Market Risk Rules, Dodd-Frank
Began running Basel II parallel in 2Q10
Tier 1 common equity ratio estimated to remain above 8% through all periods assuming the following effective dates
 Basel II and Market Risk 100% effective 12/31/11
 Basel III 100% effective 12/31/12
 Assumes no Basel III phase-in effect when in fact there is one
Pre-mitigation aggregate RWA impact is estimated to increase approximately $600B, but post known mitigation efforts, the 4Q12 RWA estimated at $1.85T vs. $1.48T at 3Q10
 Loan/asset run-off and investment sales ($75B)
 Exit proprietary trading ($65B)

Basel III capital deductions are to be phased in over 2014 to 2018, but estimate full Basel III incremental deductions at 12/31/12 at approximately $12B
 DTA NOL is the primary deduction component and will continue to decline as we generate earnings
 3Q10 OCI is positive $0.6B but assumed at $0 for this analysis

Exhibit A: Non-GAAP Reconciliations
Bank of America Corporation and Subsidiaries
Reconciliation to GAAP Financial Measures
 
(Dollars in millions)
The Corporation evaluates its business based upon a fully taxable-equivalent basis which is a non-GAAP measure. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to a fully taxable-equivalent basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The Corporation also evaluates its business based upon ratios that utilize tangible equity which is a non-GAAP measure. Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of common shareholders' equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of average shareholders' equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible common equity ratio represents common shareholders' equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible equity ratio represents total shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents ending common shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity (i.e., capital). In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders' equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. Also, the efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue. In addition, earnings and diluted earnings per common share, the efficiency ratio, return on average assets, return on average common shareholders' equity, return on average tangible common shareholders' equity and return on average tangible shareholders' equity have been calculated excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge of $10.4 billion taken during the third quarter of 2010. See below for Reconciliations of total noninterest expense, net income (loss) and net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders excluding the goodwill impairment charge to GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation.
Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. See the tables below for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the three months ended September 30, 2010, June 30, 2010, March 31, 2010, December 31, 2009 and September 30, 2009 and the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009.

In 2010, the Corporation reports results in accordance with new consolidation guidance. The 2009 periods are presented on a managed basis. Managed basis assumes that securitized loans were not sold and presents earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold (i.e., held loans) are presented. Loan securitization is an alternative funding process that is used by the Corporation to diversify funding sources. In prior periods, loan securitization removed loans from the Consolidated Balance Sheet through the sale of loans to an off-balance sheet qualifying special purpose entity which was excluded from the Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP applicable at the time.
Global Card Services
The performance of the managed portfolio is important in understanding results as it demonstrates the results of the entire portfolio serviced by the business. Securitized loans continue to be serviced by the business and are subject to the same underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring as held loans. In addition, excess servicing income is exposed to similar credit risk and repricing of interest rates as held loans. In prior periods, managed income statement line items differed from a held basis reported as follows:
