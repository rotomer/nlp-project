On November 4, 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California granted a motion by Countrywide Financial Corporation and affiliated entities ("Countrywide") to dismiss the amended complaint in the action in its entirety, with leave to amend. The court ruled that the named plaintiffs have standing to sue only over offerings of mortgage-backed securities in which they actually purchased securities, and that the statute of limitations would be tolled only for offerings in which the named plaintiffs in the previously-filed California state court action entitled , on which the plaintiffs relied for tolling purposes, had also purchased. The plaintiffs were given 30 days to file a second amended complaint consistent with the court's ruling. The court also said that it will address Countrywide's other arguments for dismissal not addressed in its ruling when it considers any new complaint that may be filed. Bank of America Corporation (the "Corporation") expects that the court's ruling will result in a substantial reduction of the number of offerings at issue in the case.

Bank of America Corporation today announced that on November 4, 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California granted Countrywide Financial Corporation's ("Countrywide") motion to dismiss the amended complaint in the putative securities class action entitled .

Maine State Retirement System v. Countrywide Financial Corporation, et al
Maine State
On November 14, 2007, a putative class action complaint was filed in California state court entitled (""), which asserted alleged violations of the Securities Act of 1933 in connection with certain offerings of mortgage-backed securities issued by affiliates of Countrywide. The complaint later was amended to include additional offerings. On January 6, 2010, the state court granted Countrywide's motion to dismiss the action with prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and the case was filed in federal court on January 14, 2010. Like the amended complaint, the amended Maine State complaint alleges violations of the federal securities laws in regard to more than 420 mortgage-backed securities offerings issued by Countrywide affiliates and names Countrywide and other entities and individuals as defendants.

The Court also said that it will address Countrywide's other arguments for dismissal not addressed in its November 4 order when it considers any new complaint that is filed. Bank of America Corporation expects that the Court's ruling will result in a substantial reduction in the number of offerings at issue in the case, from 427 offerings (which had a total notional amount at issuance of approximately $352 billion) to no more than approximately 22 offerings (which had a total notional amount at issuance of approximately $31 billion).
