CHARLOTTE  Bank of America Corporation today reported a net loss of $1.2 billion, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2010, including the previously announced goodwill impairment charge of $2.0 billion in the Home Loans and Insurance segment. Excluding the goodwill impairment charge, the company earned $756 million, or $ 0.04 per share.

Results for the most recent quarter also include a $4.1 billion provision expense for outstanding and future mortgage repurchase claims, including the previously announced $3.0 billion related to the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs). Also included in the company's fourth-quarter results are $1.5 billion in litigation expenses, excluding fees paid to external legal service providers, primarily in the company's consumer businesses, and lower sales and trading revenues. These factors were partially offset by the continued reduction in credit costs, approximately $360 million in net gains from the sale of non-core assets, and a $1.2 billion income tax benefit from a valuation allowance release.
For the year, Bank of America had goodwill impairment charges of $12.4 billion, which resulted in a net loss of $2.2 billion, or $0.37 per diluted share. Excluding the goodwill impairment charges, the company earned $10.2 billion, or $0.86 per diluted share.
During the year, the company also recorded $2.6 billion in litigation expenses, $6.8 billion in representations and warranties provision and $321 million in gains related to legacy assets as it made significant progress resolving legacy issues.
 
 
 
 
"Last year was a necessary repair and rebuilding year," said President and Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan. "Our results reflect the progress we are making at putting legacy  primarily mortgage-related  issues behind us. We earned $10.2 billion before goodwill impairment charges, rebuilt our capital positions, reduced the risk on our balance sheet, and shed more than $19 billion in assets that didn't directly serve customers and clients.
"We enter 2011 with the best customer franchise in the business against a backdrop of an improving economy. Full economic recovery depends on housing market stability. We will return value to shareholders by focusing on customers and clients, continuing to build capital, and executing our strategy."

Fourth-Quarter 2010 Revenue and Expense
 
 
 
Revenue, net of interest expense, on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis fell 11 percent from the fourth quarter of 2009. Net interest income on an FTE basis increased 7 percent from a year earlier. Adjusting for the impact of adopting new consolidation guidance on January 1, 2010, revenue for the fourth quarter of 2010 was down 20 percent from the fourth quarter of 2009.
Noninterest income declined 26 percent, or $3.6 billion, from the year-ago quarter due to lower mortgage banking income as a result of a $3.6 billion increase in representations and warranties provision, $720 million lower service charges and a $994 million decline in equity investment income and trading account profits. These factors were partially offset by year-over-year improvements in other income driven by lower losses on structured liabilities and increases in card income due to the adoption of new consolidation guidance.
Noninterest expense was up 27 percent from the year-ago quarter, driven in part by the $2.0 billion goodwill impairment charge. Excluding the goodwill impairment charge, noninterest expense was up 15 percent, or $2.5 billion, from a year ago, due primarily to a $933 million increase in litigation expenses, $1.4 billion in higher personnel costs as the company builds out businesses such as wealth management and international capital markets, and a $113 million rise in professional fees. Pretax merger and restructuring charges declined $163 million from a year earlier to $370 million. Results also reflect a $2.4 billion tax benefit that includes a $1.2 billion income tax asset valuation allowance release.

2010 Revenue and Expense
 
 
 
For the full year 2010, revenue, net of interest expense, on an FTE basis fell 8 percent from the prior year. Net interest income on an FTE basis increased 9 percent from a year earlier, reflecting the impact of the adoption of new consolidation guidance.
Noninterest income declined from the prior year due primarily to lower mortgage banking income, reflecting $6.8 billion in representations and warranties costs. In addition, there were declines in the following areas: equity investment income, gains on sales of debt securities, trading account profits, service charges and insurance income. These factors were partially offset by year-over-year improvements in other income driven largely by essentially flat fair value adjustments on structured liabilities, compared to negative fair value adjustments of $4.9 billion in the year-ago period, and increases in card income due to the adoption of new consolidation guidance.
Noninterest expense was up from the prior year, primarily reflecting the $12.4 billion in goodwill impairment charges. Excluding these charges, noninterest expense was up 6 percent from a year ago attributable largely to an increase in personnel costs of $3.6 billion, reflecting the building out of several businesses including the international capital markets platform and a $1.6 billion increase in litigation expenses. Pretax merger and restructuring charges declined $901 million from a year earlier to $1.8 billion.

Fourth-Quarter 2010 Credit Quality
 
 
 
n/a = not applicable
Note: Ratios do not include loans measured under the fair value option.
Credit quality continued to improve during the fourth quarter, with net charge-offs continuing to decline across nearly all portfolios. Credit costs, while still at elevated levels, fell for the sixth consecutive quarter. Additionally, delinquencies 30 days past due or more and still accruing, excluding Federal Housing Administration-insured loans, declined for the seventh consecutive quarter, and reservable criticized utilized levels decreased for the fifth consecutive quarter.
Net charge-offs declined $414 million from the third quarter of 2010, reflecting improvement in both the consumer and commercial portfolios. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact of a continued decline in delinquencies and bankruptcies across the U.S. Global Card Services loan portfolios and a decline in delinquencies in the home equity portfolio.

The allowance for loan and lease losses to annualized net charge-off coverage ratio improved in the fourth quarter to 1.56 times, compared with 1.53 times in the third quarter of 2010 and 1.11 times in the fourth quarter of 2009. Excluding purchased credit-impaired loans, the allowance to annualized net charge-off coverage ratio was 1.32, 1.34 and 1.01 times for the same periods, respectively.
Nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were $32.7 billion at December 31, 2010, down 5 percent from $34.6 billion at September 30, 2010, and 9 percent from $35.7 billion at December 31, 2009.
The provision for credit losses was $5.1 billion, $267 million lower than the third quarter and $5.0 billion lower than the same period a year earlier. The provision was $1.7 billion lower than net charge-offs, resulting in a reduction in the allowance for loan and lease losses for the quarter. This compares with a $1.8 billion reduction in the third quarter and the addition of $1.7 billion a year earlier.
Improved delinquencies and bankruptcies in the U.S. credit card, small business and consumer lending businesses in the fourth quarter led to a reduction in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Additionally, continuing improvement in economic conditions contributed to an allowance reduction in the core commercial portfolio. These were partially offset by allowance additions of $828 million related to consumer purchased credit-impaired portfolios obtained in prior periods through acquisitions.
2010 Credit Quality
 
 
 
n/a = not applicable
Note: Ratios do not include loans measured under the fair value option.
Broad-based improvement across most portfolios drove lower credit costs in 2010, resulting in a reduction in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Full-year provision for credit losses was $28.4 billion compared to $48.6 billion in 2009 or less than half of 2009 managed credit costs of $60 billion. The improving portfolio trends throughout the year were across most of the consumer and commercial businesses, particularly the U.S. credit card, small business and consumer lending businesses, as well as core commercial loan portfolios. The allowance reductions were partially

offset by additions related to consumer purchased credit-impaired portfolios obtained in prior periods through acquisitions.
Net charge-offs were $646 million higher than the prior year due to the adoption of new consolidation guidance, partially offset by decreases in charge-offs across most portfolios due to the improving portfolio trends noted above.
Capital and Liquidity Management
 
(Dollars in millions, except per share information)
 
 
 
The company's liquidity position strengthened during the fourth quarter. The company's total global excess liquidity rose approximately $12 billion from the third quarter of 2010 to $336 billion. At December 31, 2010, the company's time-to-required funding was 24 months.
During the quarter, a cash dividend of $0.01 per common share was paid, and the company declared $321 million in preferred dividends. Period-end common shares issued and outstanding were 10.09 billion for the fourth quarter, 10.03 billion for the third quarter of 2010 and 8.65 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase in outstanding shares year over year was driven primarily by the conversion of common equivalent shares into common stock in the first quarter of 2010, the issuance of common stock under employee plans during the year and the conversion of the mandatory convertible preferred stock in the fourth quarter of 2010.

Business Segment Results
Deposits
 
 
 
 
full-year 2010 net income of $1.4 billion declined $1.2 billion from a year ago due to decreases in revenue and higher noninterest expense.
Deposits
The revenue decline was driven by the impact of Regulation E (Reg E), which was effective in the third quarter of 2010 and the overdraft policy changes implemented in the fourth quarter of 2009. These were partially offset by increased net interest income due to a customer shift to more liquid products and continued pricing discipline.
Noninterest expense increased 14 percent from a year ago as a result of a higher proportion of costs associated with banking center sales and service efforts being aligned to Deposits from the other segments and increased litigation expenses in 2010. The prior year included a special FDIC assessment of $362 million.
Average deposits were up 1 percent from a year ago mainly due to the transfer of certain deposits from other client-managed businesses as well as organic growth, partially offset by the expected runoff of higher-cost legacy Countrywide deposits.
Deposits reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $201 million, compared to net income of $610 million during the same period last year due to a decline in revenue and an increase in noninterest expense. Revenue declined due to the impact of Reg E, partially offset by increased net interest income due to a customer shift to more liquid products and continued pricing discipline. Noninterest expense increased due to the increased litigation expenses and as a result of higher proportion of costs associated with banking center sales and service efforts being aligned to Deposits from other business segments.

Global Card Services
 
 
 
 
n/m = not meaningful
reported a full-year net loss of $6.6 billion due to the $10.4 billion goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter. Excluding this charge, Global Card Services net income was $3.8 billion, compared to a net loss of $5.3 billion a year ago as both credit costs and noninterest expense declined. During the year, risk-adjusted margin for consumer credit card increased to 2.92 percent compared to 1.92 percent in 2009, primarily driven by improvement in credit quality.
Global Card Services
Revenue decreased $3.4 billion from a year ago driven by lower average loans, reduced interest and fee income primarily resulting from the implementation of the CARD Act and the impact of recording a provision related to future payment protection insurance claims in the U.K. This decrease was partially offset by the gain on the sale of the MasterCard position in 2010.
Provision for credit losses decreased $16.9 billion from a year ago driven primarily by lower delinquencies and decreasing bankruptcies as a result of the improved economic environment. This resulted in reserve reductions of $7.0 billion in 2010 compared to reserve increases of $3.4 billion in 2009 and $6.5 billion lower net charge-offs.
Noninterest expense increased compared to a year ago due to the $10.4 billion goodwill impairment charge. Excluding this impairment charge, noninterest expense decreased 10 percent compared to the year-ago period as a higher proportion of

costs associated with banking center sales and service efforts were aligned to Deposits from Global Card Services.
Net income of $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to a net loss of $994 million during the same period last year due to lower credit costs as the economy improved. Revenue declined 12 percent during the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with the same period a year ago driven by lower average loans and reduced interest and fee income primarily resulting from the implementation of the CARD Act.
Home Loans and Insurance
 
 
 
 
reported a full-year net loss of $8.9 billion for 2010 primarily due to $6.8 billion in representations and warranties expense and a $2.0 billion goodwill impairment charge.
Home Loans and Insurance
Revenue declined by $6.3 billion, or 37 percent, driven by an increase of $4.9 billion in representations and warranties expense and a $1.2 billion decline in mortgage production revenue. The decline in production revenue was primarily due to a decline in loan volumes reflecting a drop in the overall size of the mortgage market.
Provision for credit losses decreased $2.8 billion driven by improving portfolio trends including a lower reserve addition for the Countrywide purchased credit-impaired home equity portfolio. Excluding the goodwill impairment charge, noninterest expense increased $1.5 billion from a year ago due to higher litigation expenses and an increase in default-related servicing expenses, partially offset by lower production expense and insurance losses.
 
More
Page 13
 
The fourth-quarter 2010 net loss of $5.0 billion compared to a net loss of $1.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase was primarily due to representations and warranties expense of $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010, which includes $3.0 billion related to the previously announced GSE agreements as well as adjustments to the representations and warranties liability for other loans sold directly to the GSEs and not covered by those agreements. Excluding the $2.0 billion goodwill impairment charge, Home Loans and Insurance net loss was $3.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2010.
Bank of America believes that it has addressed its remaining exposure to repurchase obligations for residential mortgage loans sold directly to the GSEs through the $3.0 billion increase in representations and warranties provision referred to above. The calculation of the provision incorporates historical experience with the GSEs and certain assumptions regarding home prices and other economic matters, and future provisions for representations and warranties may be affected if the actual results are different.
At December 31, 2010, the company's unresolved repurchase requests totaled approximately $10.7 billion, compared with $12.9 billion on September 30, 2010 and $7.6 billion at the end of 2009. The liability for representations and warranties was $5.4 billion at December 31, 2010, compared with $4.4 billion on September 30, 2010, and $3.5 billion at the end of 2009. The increase in the liability reflects the $6.8 billion in representations and warranties provision expensed during the year, less payments made to various counterparties.
Compared to the same period in the prior year, results in the fourth quarter of 2010 were also impacted by the $2.0 billion goodwill impairment charge, increased default and other loss mitigation servicing expenses, partially offset by more favorable mortgage servicing rights results. Provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter of 2010 decreased as compared to the same period in the prior year driven by lower net charge-offs and improving portfolio trends.

Global Commercial Banking
 
 
 
 
full-year net income increased $3.5 billion from the year-ago loss of $290 million due to lower credit costs.
Global Commercial Banking
Revenue decreased $238 million from a year ago primarily due to a lower residual net interest income allocation related to asset and liability management activities and increased costs from an agreement to purchase certain loans. These factors were partially offset by credit pricing discipline, which negated the impact of lower loan volumes, and continued deposit growth from existing clients.
The provision for credit losses decreased $5.8 billion to $2.0 billion for the year compared to 2009. The decrease was driven by improvements primarily in the commercial real estate portfolio, reflecting stabilizing values and the U.S. commercial portfolio, reflecting improved borrower credit profiles. All other portfolios experienced lower net charge-offs attributable to more stable economic conditions.
Average deposit balances continued to grow, increasing by $18.7 billion, as clients managed to new liquidity levels. Although average loan and lease balances decreased $25.8 billion from a year ago due to client deleveraging and low loan demand, ending commercial and industrial loan balances have grown approximately 2 percent from the third quarter of 2010, showing stability.
Fourth-quarter 2010 net income increased to $1.0 billion compared to a net loss of $31 million in the same period last year. The provision for credit losses decreased $2.0 billion compared to the same period in 2009. Revenues and provision for credit losses declined due to the same factors as described in the full-year discussion above.

Page 15
 
Global Banking and Markets
 
 
 
 
full-year net income decreased $3.7 billion compared to the prior year. Revenue decreased primarily due to the weak trading environment and losses on certain market positions. The prior year included a $3.8 billion gain on the contribution of the merchant services business to a joint venture, which was largely offset by market disruption charges. The provision for credit losses declined $2.2 billion due to lower net charge-offs in the corporate portfolio reflecting improvement in borrower credit profiles and lower reservable criticized levels.
Global Banking and Markets
Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities sales and trading revenue of $13.2 billion increased $435 million compared to a year ago as a reduction in market activity and increased investor risk aversion in 2010 were offset by significantly lower market disruption charges.
Equities sales and trading revenue declined to $4.1 billion from $4.9 billion a year ago, driven primarily by a decrease in volumes as well as adverse market conditions in the equity derivatives business.
Noninterest expense increased $2.1 billion driven by higher compensation costs, approximately $400 million for the U.K. bonus tax in the second quarter, and the recognition of expense on proportionately larger prior year incentive deferrals. Income tax expense was adversely affected by a charge related to the U.K. tax rate reduction impacting the carrying value of the deferred tax asset.
Fourth-quarter 2010 net income declined to $724 million compared with $1.4 billion a year earlier as revenues remained flat and a benefit in the provision for credit losses due to lower net charge-offs and reserve reductions was offset by higher compensation expense.

Global Wealth and Investment Management
 
 
 
 
full-year 2010 net income decreased $369 million from a year earlier driven by higher noninterest expense and the tax-related effect from the sale of the Columbia long-term business, partially offset by higher noninterest income and lower credit costs.
Global Wealth and Investment Management
Revenue increased $534 million from a year earlier to $16.7 billion driven by higher asset management fees and transactional revenue.
For the year, provision for credit losses decreased $415 million from a year ago to $646 million, driven by lower net charge-offs in the consumer real estate and commercial portfolios, along with the absence of a prior-year single large commercial charge-off. Noninterest expense increased from a year ago due primarily to higher revenue-related expenses, support costs and personnel costs associated with further development of the business.
Fourth-quarter 2010 net income decreased $197 million to $332 million compared with the same period last year, reflecting higher provision for credit losses. Revenue increased to $4.3 billion, compared to $4.0 billion in the year-ago quarter, due in part to increased deposits. Asset management fees rose to $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting positive market and long-term client flows.

Page 17
 
All Other
 
reported full-year net income of $1.1 billion, down $241 million from $1.3 billion a year ago, as higher revenue reflected an increase in net interest income and positive fair value adjustments related to structured liabilities, compared to negative fair value adjustments of $4.9 billion in the year-ago period. These items were offset by a significantly higher provision for credit losses, lower equity investment gains and lower gains on sales of debt securities in 2010 as compared to 2009.
All Other
The provision for credit losses increased to $4.6 billion from a provision benefit of $3.4 billion a year ago, primarily due to the impact of the new consolidation guidance as the prior year included a securitization offset to present Global Card Services on a managed basis. Additionally, the provision for credit losses was adversely impacted by further reserve increases to the Countrywide purchased-credit impaired discontinued real estate portfolio. These items were partially offset by a lower provision for credit losses related to the residential mortgage portfolio due to improving portfolio trends.
Fourth-quarter 2010 net income of $346 million increased $1.1 billion from a $749 million loss a year earlier primarily driven by lower negative fair value adjustments related to structured liabilities and a significantly lower provision for credit losses compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to the impact of the new consolidation guidance.
All Other consists primarily of equity investments, the residential mortgage portfolio associated with asset and liability management (ALM) activities, the residual impact of the cost allocation process, merger and restructuring charges, intersegment eliminations, fair value adjustments related to structured liabilities and the results of certain consumer finance, investment management and commercial lending businesses that are being liquidated. Prior to January 1, 2010, All Other also included the offsetting securitization impact to present Global Card Services on a managed basis.

Reconciliation to GAAP Financial Measures
 
(Dollars in millions, shares in thousands)
The Corporation evaluates its business based upon a FTE basis which is a non-GAAP measure. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on a FTE basis and noninterest income. The Corporation views related ratios and analyses (i.e., efficiency ratios and net interest yield) on a FTE basis. The adjustment of net interest income to a FTE basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The Corporation also evaluates its business based upon ratios that utilize tangible equity which is a non-GAAP measure. Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of common shareholders' equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of average shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible common equity ratio represents common shareholders' equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible equity ratio represents total shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per share of common stock represents ending common shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by ending common shares outstanding plus the number of common shares issued upon conversion of common equivalent shares. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity (i.e., capital). In addition, profitability, relationship, and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders' equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. Also, the efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue. In addition, earnings and diluted earnings per common share, the efficiency ratio, return on average assets, return on common shareholders' equity, return on average tangible common shareholders' equity and return on average tangible shareholders' equity have been calculated excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charges taken during 2010. See below reconciliations of total noninterest expense, net income (loss) and net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders excluding the goodwill impairment charges to GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation.
Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. See the tables below for corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the three months ended December 31, 2010, September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, and for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Reconciliation - Managed to GAAP
 
(Dollars in millions)
In 2010, the Corporation reports results in accordance with new consolidation guidance. The 2009 periods are presented on a managed basis. Managed basis assumes that securitized loans were not sold and presents earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold (i.e., held loans) are presented. Loan securitization is an alternative funding process that is used by the Corporation to diversify funding sources. In the 2009 periods, loan securitization removed loans from the Consolidated Balance Sheet through the sale of loans to an off-balance sheet qualifying special purpose entity which was excluded from the Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP applicable at the time.
Global Card Services
The performance of the managed portfolio is important in understanding results as it demonstrates the results of the entire portfolio serviced by the business. Securitized loans continue to be serviced by the business and are subject to the same underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring as held loans. In addition, excess servicing income is exposed to similar credit risk and repricing of interest rates as held loans. In the 2009 periods, managed income statement line items differed from a held basis reported as follows:

Commentary vs. 3Q10
 -  Net interest income was flat and the net interest yield declined 3 bps to 2.69%
 NII was reduced as a result of
 -  Reduced yields on the discretionary portfolio ($450M)
 -  Lower consumer loan balances excluding residential mortgages ($175M)
 But benefited from:
 -  Increased discretionary portfolio levels of securities and residential mortgages ($250M)
 -  Hedge income ($250M)
 -  Reduced long-term debt ($125M)
 -  On track to meet goal of 15 to 20% long-term debt reductions relative to 3Q10 by end of 2011 and longer term goal of $150 to $200B by the end of 2013
 -  Expect NII in 1H11 to be below 4Q10 level before stabilizing near mid-year 2011

% GSEs 43% 46% 50% 53% 26%
 -  74% of new claims over the past year were from 2006 & 2007 vintages
Commentary
 -  4Q10 representations and warranties provision of $4.1B increased as the current quarter included $3.0B in provision relating primarily to the impact of previously announced agreements with GSEs
 -  $8.0B of claims were resolved during the quarter, including $4.9B as part of the GSE agreements, leading to an overall $2.3B reduction in claims
 Monoline claims outstanding continue to grow as the monolines continue to submit claims and are generally unwilling to withdraw claims despite evidence refuting the claims
 $1.9B in claims were received during the quarter from whole loan and private label securitization investors substantially related to 2005 through 2007 origination vintages 1
 -  Increase in rescissions and approvals in 4Q10 was substantially impacted by the previously announced agreements with the GSEs
1 Includes $1.7B in claims contained in communications from private label securitizations investors that do not have the right to demand repurchase of loans directly or the right to access loan files. The inclusion of these claims in the amounts noted does not mean that we believe these claims have satisfied the contractual threshholds to direct the securitization trustee to take action or are otherwise procedurally or substantively valid.
 
Non-GSE Experience  2004-2008 Originations
 -  From 2004 through 2008, $963B of loans were sold into private label securitizations or through whole loan sales
Origination Issuer Originations by Product
74% originated through Countrywide 31% were prime originations
10% originated through legacy BAC 18% were Alt-A
7% originated through legacy Merrill Lynch 16% were pay option prime originations
9% originated through other legacy firms 26% were subprime originations
9% were second lien originations
 -  Repurchase claims activity through December 31, 2010:
$13.7B of repurchase claims received on 2004-2008 vintages
 -  $5.6B in claims from monoline insurers
 -  $5.7B in claims from whole loan buyers
 -  $1.7B in demands from private label securitization investors who do not have the contractual right to demand repurchase of loans directly 1
 -  $800M in claims from one counterparty submitted prior to 2009
$6.0B of resolved repurchase claims on 2004-2008 vintages
 -  $800M resolved with monolines; 15% were rescinded (mostly second lien)
 -  $5.2B resolved with private investors; 59% were rescinded
$7.7B repurchase claims remain outstanding on the 2004-2008 vintages
 -  $4.1B have been reviewed and declined for repurchase
 -  $1.7B in demands from private label securitization investors who do not have the contractual right to demand repurchase of loans directly 1
Repurchase losses of $1.7B
 -  $630M related to monolines
 -  $1.1B with private investors
 -  Experience to date reflects:
22.4% of loans sold have defaulted or are severely delinquent
 -  58% ($126B) of defaulted or severely delinquent loans made at least 25 payments prior to default or delinquency
 Not all defaulted or severely delinquent loans will be repurchased
 Significant differences between GSE and private label representations and warranties deal terms (slide 21)
1The inclusion of these claims in the amounts noted on slide 19 does not mean that we believe these claims have satisfied the contractual threshholds to direct the securitization trustee to take action or are otherwise procedurally or substantively valid
 
 
Key Private Label Differences in
Representations and Warranties (vs. GSEs)
Significant aspects of private label transactions that differ from GSE sales are summarized below:
General Compliance General representation of material compliance with underwriting guidelines (which permits exceptions)
Fraud Virtually all deals do not contain a representation that there has been no fraud or material misrepresentation by borrower or third party
Acceptable Investment No representation that the mortgage is of investment quality
Materiality Many representations include materiality qualifiers
Causation Breach of representation must materially and adversely affect certificate holders' interest in the loan
Disclosure Offering documents included extensive disclosures including detailed risk factors, description of underwriting practice and guidelines, and loan attributes.
Claim Presentation Rights Only parties to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (PSA ) (e.g., the Trustee) can bring such repurchase claims; certificate holders cannot bring claims directly. 25% of each tranche of certificate holders generally required in order to direct trustee to review loan files for potential claims. Investors must bear costs of Trustee's loan file review.
Liability for Repurchase Repurchase liability, generally limited to seller
 
Government Sponsored Enterprise (GSE) Experience  2004-2008 Originations
 -  From 2004 through 2008, $1.1T of loans sold directly to GSEs
 -  Recent agreement with Freddie Mac for $1.28B extinguishes outstanding and potential mortgage repurchase and make-whole claims arising out of any alleged breaches of selling representations and warranties related to loans sold by legacy Countrywide to Freddie Mac through 2008
 -  Recent agreement with Fannie Mae for $1.52B substantially resolves the existing pipeline of repurchase and make-whole claims outstanding as of September 20, 2010, arising out of alleged breaches of selling representations and warranties related to loans sold by legacy Countrywide to Fannie Mae
 -  We believe the remaining representations and warranties exposure for loans sold directly to the GSEs has been addressed as a result of these agreements and the associated adjustments to the accrued liability for representations and warranties
 Based on the models derived from the historical GSE experience, we believe we are 70 to 75% through the receipt of GSE repurchase claims
 Our liability for GSEs fully reflects claims received as well as an estimate of claims still expected
 The liability assumes no material changes in experience with GSEs, home prices, or other factors
 -  Preliminary estimates of repurchase claims as of 12/31/10 reflect:
$21.6B of repurchase claims received on 2004-2008 vintages
$18.2B of resolved repurchase claims on 2004-2008 vintages with loss experience of 27% of resolved claim requests 1
 -  Experience to date reflects:
Slightly less than 10% of loans sold have defaulted or are severely delinquent
Collateral loss severity rate on approved repurchases of approximately 4555%
 -  55% of delinquent or defaulted loans made at least 25 payments prior to default or delinquency
1 Claims resolved and the loss rate exclude $839M in claims extinguished as a result of the agreement with Freddie Mac due to the global nature of the agreement and, specifically, the absence of a formal apportionment of the agreement amount between current and future claims.

Exhibit A: Non-GAAP Reconciliations
Bank of America Corporation and Subsidiaries
Reconciliation to GAAP Financial Measures
 
(Dollars in millions)
The Corporation evaluates its business based upon a fully taxable-equivalent basis which is a non-GAAP measure. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and noninterest income. The Corporation views related ratios and analyses (i.e., efficiency ratios and net interest yield) on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. The adjustment of net interest income to a fully taxable-equivalent basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The Corporation also evaluates its business based upon ratios that utilize tangible equity which is a non-GAAP measure. Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of common shareholders' equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of average shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible common equity ratio represents common shareholders' equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible equity ratio represents total shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per share of common stock represents ending common shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by ending common shares outstanding plus the number of common shares issued upon conversion of common equivalent shares. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity (i.e., capital). In addition, profitability, relationship, and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders' equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. Also, the efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue. In addition, earnings and diluted earnings per common share, the efficiency ratio, return on average assets, return on common shareholders' equity, return on average tangible common shareholders' equity and return on average tangible shareholders' equity have been calculated excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charges taken during 2010. See below reconciliations of total noninterest expense, net income (loss) and net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders excluding the goodwill impairment charges to GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation.
Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. See the tables below and on page 47 for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the three months ended December 31, 2010, September 30, 2010, June 30, 2010, March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 and the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.

In 2010, the Corporation reports results in accordance with new consolidation guidance. The 2009 periods are presented on a managed basis. Managed basis assumes that securitized loans were not sold and presents earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold (i.e., held loans) are presented. Loan securitization is an alternative funding process that is used by the Corporation to diversify funding sources. In the 2009 periods, loan securitization removed loans from the Consolidated Balance Sheet through the sale of loans to an off-balance sheet qualifying special purpose entity which was excluded from the Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP applicable at the time.
Global Card Services
The performance of the managed portfolio is important in understanding results as it demonstrates the results of the entire portfolio serviced by the business. Securitized loans continue to be serviced by the business and are subject to the same underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring as held loans. In addition, excess servicing income is exposed to similar credit risk and repricing of interest rates as held loans. In the 2009 periods, managed income statement line items differed from a held basis reported as follows:

Addressing Legacy Mortgage Issues
Representations and Warranties
 -  Important step forward as a result of agreements with GSEs announced on January 3, 2011
 -  Recorded expense in 4Q10 of $3B for representations and warranties for loans sold directly to the GSEs
 -  We believe the remaining representations and warranties exposure for loans sold directly to the GSEs has been addressed as a result of these agreements and the associated adjustments to the liability for representations and warranties
 Ongoing liability assumes no material changes in experience with GSEs, home prices or other economic conditions
 -  Experience with non-GSE claims remains limited
 No change in approach on non-GSE claims
 If valid claims are presented in accordance with contractual rights, loan repurchase claims will be processed appropriately
Modifications
 -  Completed 285K modifications in 2010 and 775K modifications cumulatively since 2008 by Bank of America and (previously) Countrywide
 The 285K modifications in 2010 include 109K customers who converted from trial modifications under MHA
 -  Completed 76K modifications in 4Q10
 -  Actions continue to be taken to internally realign resources to focus on loan modification efforts
 In early December, announced that more than 2,500 Centralized Sales and Fulfillment associates would be deployed to Servicing over the next several months to support the expected peak default volumes in 2011
 Moving associates from Small Business, Card and other areas into HL&I to assist with Servicing
 
Addressing Legacy Mortgage Issues (cont'd)
Foreclosures
 -  Resumed foreclosure sales in most non-judicial states in early December, starting with vacant and non-owner occupied properties; expect to resume sales in remaining states in 1Q11
 -  Maintaining a deliberate and phased approach
 -  Remain committed to ensure no property is taken to foreclosure improperly
 -  Review of our foreclosure process shows the basis for our decisions has been accurate
 -  Process areas identified for improvement

Commentary vs. 3Q10
 -  Sales and trading revenue decreased $1.9B from 3Q10 as a result of positioning in a weak trading environment, seasonal trading declines and reduction of risk-weighted assets by 11% with daily average VaR falling 15% during the quarter
 -  FICC revenue of $1.8B decreased $1.7B compared to 3Q10 as spread tightening early in the quarter was offset by diminished client activity and European debt deterioration
 -  Equity revenue of $789M is down $185M from 3Q10 as an increase in cash business commission revenue was more than offset by a decline in market volatility and client flows impacting derivatives

Impact of FHA-Insured Loans on Delinquencies
Commentary vs. 3Q10

Commentary vs. 3Q10
 -  Capital ratios improved as a result of:
 Net income less goodwill impairment charges, mark to market of certain structured liabilities and dividends increased (structured liability mark impacts TCE ratio but not regulatory ratios)
 4Q10 also included $1.5B conversion of preferred stock to common stock
 EOP assets declined $75B and reduced risk-weighted assets by more than $20B
 Partially offset by an increase in the DTA disallowance
