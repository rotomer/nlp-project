Bank of America Corporation Bank of America Corporate Center 100 North Tryon Street Charlotte, North Carolina 28255
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as counsel to Bank of America Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-152418) (the "Registration Statement"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and the Prospectus dated July 21, 2008 constituting a part thereof (the "Prospectus"), relating to the issuance and sale from time to time by the Corporation of its senior or subordinated debt securities (collectively referred to herein as the "Notes"). The Notes are to be issued and sold from time to time as set forth in the Prospectus and amendments or supplements thereto.
     The Notes to be are issued under the terms of (a) the Amended and Restated Senior Indenture dated July 1, 2001 between the Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., the successor trustee to The Bank of New York) as trustee, as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 23, 2011 (as so supplemented, and as further supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Senior Indenture") or (b) the Amended and Restated Subordinated Indenture dated July 1, 2001 between the Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., the successor trustee to The Bank of New York) as trustee, as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 23, 2011 (as so supplemented, and as further supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Subordinated Indenture" and, together with the Senior Indenture, the "Indentures").
     As such counsel to the Corporation, we have examined and are familiar with such originals, photocopies or certified copies of such records of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, certificates of officers of the Corporation and its subsidiaries and of public officials, and such other documents as we have deemed relevant or necessary as the basis for the opinion set forth below. In such examinations, we have assumed the legal capacity of natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures on, and the authenticity of, all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as photocopies thereof and the authenticity

of the originals of such copies. As to certain factual matters relevant to this opinion, we have relied upon certificates or other comparable documents of public officials, certain representations of the Corporation and statements and certifications of officers or other appropriate representatives of the Corporation and its subsidiaries.
     Based solely upon the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, and subject to the limitations, qualifications and exceptions set forth below, we are of the opinion that when the terms of the Notes have been duly authorized and established by the Corporation, the trustee under the applicable indenture has made an appropriate entry on Schedule 1 to the Master Registered Global Senior Note, dated July 21, 2008 (the "Master Senior Note") or to the Master Registered Global Subordinated Note, dated July 21, 2008 (the "Master Subordinated Note"), as applicable, identifying the Notes as supplemental obligations thereunder in accordance with the instructions of the Corporation, and the Notes have been delivered against payment of the consideration therefor as contemplated by the Prospectus and the pricing supplement thereto relating to the Notes, all in accordance with the (i) terms of the Senior Indenture or the Subordinated Indenture, as applicable, and (ii) applicable underwriting or distribution agreement, the Notes will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Corporation, subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors now or hereafter in effect, and to equitable principles that may limit the right to specific enforcement of remedies, and further subject to 12 U.S.C. 1818(b)(6)(D) (or any successor statute) and any bank regulatory powers now or hereafter in effect and to the application of principles of public policy.
     In connection with the opinion expressed above, we have assumed that, at or prior to the time of the delivery of any Note: (i) the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee appointed thereby shall have duly authorized the issuance and sale of such Note and duly established the terms of such Note and such terms shall have been established by action taken pursuant to the authority of the Board of Directors or such committee and such authorization shall not have been modified or rescinded; (ii) the Corporation shall remain validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware; (iii) the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall not have been terminated or rescinded; (iv) the Indentures and the Notes have been duly authorized, completed, executed and delivered by, and are each valid, binding and enforceable agreements or obligations, as applicable, of each party thereto (other than as expressly covered above in respect of the Corporation); (v) there shall not have occurred any change in law affecting the validity or enforceability of such Note and (vi) the trustee's certificate of authentication of the Master Senior Note or the Master Subordinated Note, as applicable, has been manually signed by one of the trustee's authorized officers. We have also assumed that none of the terms of any Note to be established subsequent to the date hereof, nor the issuance and delivery of such Note, nor the compliance by the Corporation with the terms of such Note will violate any applicable law or public policy or will result in a violation of any provision of any instrument or agreement then binding upon the Corporation, or any restriction imposed by any court or governmental body having jurisdiction over the Corporation.
