On June 29, 2011, Bank of America Corporation (the "") concluded that it will write off the balance of the goodwill in its Consumer Real Estate Services (CRES) business segment and record a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of approximately $2.6 billion in the second quarter of 2011. The impairment of the goodwill in the CRES business segment is the consequence of a reduction in the fair value of this business segment resulting from the settlement described herein and from the adverse impact of the incremental mortgage-related charges and continued economic slowdown on the mortgage business.
Corporation
 
Preliminary Results for Quarter ending June 30, 2011
On June 29, 2011, the Corporation issued a press release with certain preliminary information regarding its results of operations and financial condition for the second quarter ending June 30, 2011.
Settlement Agreement
On June 29, 2011, the Corporation announced that it, BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP (""), Countrywide Financial Corporation and Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. entered into a Settlement Agreement dated as of June 28, 2011 (the "") with The Bank of New York Mellon (""), as trustee (the ""), to resolve all outstanding and potential claims related to alleged representations and warranties breaches (including repurchase claims), substantially all historical loan servicing claims and certain other historical claims with respect to 530 legacy Countrywide first-lien and second-lien residential mortgage-backed securitization (RMBS) trusts (the ""). The settlement is supported by a group of institutional investors (the "") and is subject to final court approval and certain other conditions.
BAC HLS
Settlement Agreement
BNY Mellon
Trustee
Covered Trusts
Investor Group
The Settlement Agreement provides for a cash payment of $8.5 billion (the "") after final court approval of the settlement. In addition to the Settlement Payment, the Corporation is obligated to pay attorneys' fees and costs to the Investor Group's counsel as well as all fees and expenses incurred by the Trustee in connection with the settlement, including fees and expenses related to obtaining final court approval of the settlement and certain tax rulings. The Settlement Agreement also includes provisions related to specific mortgage servicing standards and other servicing matters.
Settlement Payment
 
The settlement does not cover a small number of legacy Countrywide-issued transactions for various reasons, including for example, six legacy Countrywide-issued transactions in which BNY Mellon is not the trustee. In addition, because the settlement is with the Trustee on behalf of the Covered Trusts and releases rights under the governing agreements for the Covered Trusts, the settlement does not release investors' securities law or fraud claims based upon disclosures made in connection with their decision to purchase, sell, or hold securities issued by the trusts. To date, various investors, including certain members of the Investor Group, are pursuing securities law or fraud claims related to one or more of the Covered Trusts. The Corporation is not able to determine whether any additional securities law or fraud claims will be made by investors in the Covered Trusts and, if made, to reasonably estimate the amount of losses, if any, with respect to such asserted or potential claims. For information about mortgage-related securities law or fraud claims, see "Countrywide Equity and Debt Securities Matters" and "Mortgage-backed Securities Litigation" under "Litigation and Regulatory Matters" in to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2010
Note 14  Commitments and Contingencies
 
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 2010 and in to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2011. For those Covered Trusts where a monoline insurer or other financial guarantor has an independent right to assert repurchase claims directly, the settlement does not release such insurer's or guarantor's repurchase claims.
Note 11  Commitments and Contingencies
Given the number of Covered Trusts, the number of investors in those Covered Trusts and the complexity of the trust-based settlement, it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent challenges will be made to the settlement or the timing or ultimate outcome of the court approval process, which can include appeals and could take a substantial period of time. If final court approval is not obtained by December 31, 2015, the Corporation and legacy Countrywide may withdraw from the settlement if the Trustee consents. The Settlement Agreement also provides that if Covered Trusts representing unpaid principal balance exceeding a specified amount are excluded from the final settlement, based on investor objections or otherwise, the Corporation and legacy Countrywide have the option to withdraw from the settlement pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement.
In addition to final court approval, the settlement is conditioned on receipt of private letter rulings from the IRS as well as receipt of legal opinions under California and New York state tax laws and regulations. While there can be no assurance that such rulings or opinions will be obtained, the Corporation currently anticipates that the process related to these conditions will be completed during the period prior to final court approval.
There can be no assurance that final court approval of the settlement will be obtained, that all conditions will be satisfied or, if certain conditions in the Settlement Agreement permitting withdrawal are met, that the Corporation and legacy Countrywide will not determine to withdraw from the settlement.
The foregoing summary of the Settlement Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and is incorporated by reference herein.
Institutional Investor Agreement
In connection with the settlement, the Corporation entered into an Institutional Investor Agreement dated as of June 28, 2011 (the "") with the Investor Group. Pursuant to the Institutional Investor Agreement, the Investor Group has agreed, among other things, to use reasonable best efforts and to cooperate in good faith to effectuate the settlement, including to obtain final court approval. As previously disclosed, in October 2010, BAC HLS received a letter from Gibbs & Bruns LLP on behalf of certain members of the Investor Group alleging a servicer event of default and asserting breaches of certain loan servicing obligations, including an alleged failure to provide notice to the Trustee and other parties to the pooling and servicing agreements of breaches of representations and warranties with respect to the mortgage loans included in certain of the Covered Trusts.
Institutional Investor Agreement
The foregoing summary of the Institutional Investor Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the terms and conditions of the Institutional Investor Agreement which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.3 and is incorporated by reference herein.
Other Matters
Based on the Corporation's experience with the Investor Group with respect to the settlement, changes in the Corporation's experience with the behavior of certain counterparties in the second quarter of 2011 and other factors, the Corporation expects to record an additional charge of approximately $5.5 billion for
 
representations and warranties in the second quarter of 2011 for non-GSE and to a lesser extent GSE exposures.
After giving effect to the settlement and the additional representations and warranties charge expected to be recorded in the second quarter of 2011, the Corporation currently estimates that the range of possible loss related to non-GSE representations and warranties exposure could be up to $5 billion over expected accruals at quarter-end. This estimate of the range of possible loss for representations and warranties does not represent a probable loss, is based on currently available information, significant judgment, the terms of the settlement and a number of other assumptions that are subject to change, including information with respect to historical claims experience and counterparty behavior, likelihood of claims and assumptions related to economic conditions, including housing prices and other factors. This estimate does not include related reasonably possible litigation losses, nor does it include any separate foreclosure costs and related costs and assessments or any possible losses related to potential claims for breaches of performance of servicing obligations, potential claims under securities laws or potential indemnity or other claims against the Corporation. The Corporation is not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any possible loss with respect to any such servicing, securities or other claims; however, such loss could be material.
After giving effect to the additional GSE representations and warranties charges expected to be taken at quarter-end, based on its past experience with the GSEs, the Corporation believes that its remaining exposure to repurchase obligations for first-lien residential mortgage loans sold directly to the GSEs will be accounted for in the recorded liability for representations and warranties for these loans. The Corporation is not currently able to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of possible loss with respect to any such potential impact in excess of current reserves on future GSE provisions if the behavior of the GSEs changes from past experience. In addition, future provisions associated with representations and warranties made to the GSEs may be materially impacted if actual results are different from the Corporation's assumptions regarding economic conditions, home prices and other matters, including the behavior of the GSEs and estimated repurchase rates.
Press Release
On June 29, 2011, the Corporation issued a press release with respect to preliminary information regarding its results of operations and financial condition for the second quarter ending June 30, 2011, the Settlement Agreement, the Institutional Investor Agreement and other matters. A copy of the press release and slides for use in the investor conference call and webcast on June 29, 2011 are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and 99.4, respectively, and are incorporated by reference herein.

CHARLOTTE  Bank of America Corporation today announced that it has reached an agreement to resolve nearly all of the legacy Countrywide-issued first-lien residential mortgage-backed securitization (RMBS) repurchase exposure, representing 530 trusts with original principal balance of $424 billion.
The settlement with The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon), the trustee for the RMBS trusts covered by the settlement, is supported by a group of major institutional investors represented by Gibbs & Bruns LLP, and is subject to final court approval and certain other conditions. With this agreement and other mortgage-related actions in the second quarter of 2011, the company believes it will have recorded reserves in its financial statements for a substantial portion of its

representations and warranties exposure as measured by original unpaid principal balance. The company also is estimating a range of possible loss for the remainder.
"This is another important step we are taking in the interest of our shareholders to minimize the impact of future economic uncertainty and put legacy issues behind us," said Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan. "We will continue to act aggressively, and in the best interest of our shareholders, to clean up the mortgage issues largely stemming from our purchase of Countrywide."
The agreement includes a cash payment of $8.5 billion to the covered trusts to be made after final court approval of the settlement. Bank of America also intends to record an additional $5.5 billion provision to its representations and warranties liability for both Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSE) and non-GSE exposures in the second quarter of 2011.
Over the last six months, Bank of America and Countrywide have announced three agreements aimed at reducing exposure to legacy Countrywide mortgage issues.
In January, Bank of America announced agreements with two of its largest counterparties, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The agreement with Fannie Mae substantially resolved the existing pipeline of repurchase and make-whole claims outstanding as of September 20, 2010 arising from alleged breaches of selling representations and warranties related to loans sold by legacy Countrywide to Fannie Mae. The agreement with Freddie Mac extinguished substantially all outstanding and potential mortgage repurchase and make-whole claims arising from any alleged breaches of selling representations and warranties related to loans sold by legacy Countrywide to Freddie Mac through 2008.
In April, the company and Countrywide signed an agreement with Assured Guaranty Ltd. to resolve the monoline insurer's outstanding and potential repurchase claims related to alleged representations and warranties breaches on 29 RMBS trusts where Assured provided financial guarantee insurance.
And today, the company and Countrywide announced an agreement that covers nearly all of the legacy Countrywide-issued first-lien private-label RMBS repurchase exposure.
Second-quarter results to reflect higher mortgage-related costs
As a result of the settlement, and other mortgage-related matters, Bank of America expects to report a net loss in the range of $8.6 billion to $9.1 billion in the second quarter of 2011, or $0.88 to $0.93 per diluted share. Excluding the settlement, other mortgage-related charges, and proceeds from asset sales, the company expects to report net income in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.7 billion in the second quarter of 2011, or $0.28 to $0.33 per fully diluted share.

Page 3
 
The key driver of the expected loss is the representations and warranties provision of $14.0 billion, including $8.5 billion for the settlement agreement on legacy Countrywide mortgage repurchase and servicing claims, and an additional $5.5 billion increase in the company's representations and warranties liability for non-GSE exposures and, to a lesser extent, GSE exposures.
The company also expects to record $6.4 billion in other mortgage-related charges in the second quarter of 2011, including a non-cash, non-tax deductible impairment charge of $2.6 billion to write off the balance of goodwill in the Consumer Real Estate Services business, as well as charges related to additional litigation costs, a write-down in the value of mortgage servicing rights, and additional assessment and waiver costs for compensatory fees associated with foreclosure delays. The impairment charge will have no impact on reported Tier 1 and tangible equity capital ratios.
Settlement covers 530 RMBS trusts
The settlement covers 525 legacy Countrywide first-lien RMBS trusts and five legacy Countrywide second-lien RMBS trusts with mortgage loans principally originated between 2004 and 2008 for which BNY Mellon acts as trustee or indenture trustee. The settlement resolves representations and warranties claims, as well as substantially all historical servicing-related claims, including claims related to foreclosure delays and alleged mortgage documentation issues.
These trusts had an original principal balance of approximately $424 billion and total current unpaid principal balance of approximately $221 billion.
The 22 investors that have committed to support the settlement include many of the major U.S. and foreign institutional investors in RMBS:

Settlement includes agreement to implement servicing improvements
BAC Home Loans Servicing (BAC HLS) has agreed to implement certain servicing changes, including transferring certain high-risk loans owned by the covered trusts to qualified subservicers, benchmarking loan servicing against defined industry standards regarding default-servicing timelines (with the payment of agreed-upon fees if such benchmarks are not met), and addressing certain mortgage documentation issues. The trustee and BAC HLS have also agreed, with the support of the investor group, to clarify loss mitigation standards, reflecting a shared commitment to efficient and timely procedures to assist distressed borrowers.
Certain servicing and documentation obligations begin upon signing of the settlement agreement, while others, including potential payment of servicing-related fees, are conditioned on final court approval of the settlement. The company estimates the costs associated with additional servicing obligations under the settlement agreement to be approximately $400 million, which will contribute to the second-quarter 2011 valuation charge related to the mortgage servicing rights asset. The additional servicing actions are consistent with the recently announced orders with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Reserve.
Settlement subject to final court approval
The obligation of Bank of America and Countrywide to make the $8.5 billion settlement payment and to pay certain other money or fees under the settlement is subject to final court approval of the settlement and certain other conditions. In addition, the obligations of the trustee are subject to the satisfaction of the conditions in the settlement agreement.
BNY Mellon, as trustee, has determined that the settlement is in the best interests of the covered trusts and is seeking the necessary court approval of the settlement by commencing a judicial proceeding, requesting that the court approve the settlement as to all of the covered trusts. It is expected that the court will schedule a hearing on the settlement and direct a notice program pursuant to which BNY Mellon will notify certificateholders and noteholders in the covered trusts of the settlement terms. It is expected that certificateholders and noteholders will be given the opportunity to file objections to the settlement before a final hearing is held on the settlement.

The institutional investors involved in negotiating the settlement have committed to support the settlement by, among other things, requesting that BNY Mellon enter into the settlement, moving to intervene as parties in the settlement approval court proceeding in support of the settlement, and using reasonable best efforts to obtain final court approval of the settlement.
It is not possible to predict whether and to what extent challenges will be made to the settlement or the timing or ultimate outcome of the court approval process, which can include appeals and could take a substantial period of time. There can be no assurance that final court approval of the settlement will be obtained, that all conditions will be satisfied or, if certain conditions in the settlement agreement permitting withdrawal are met, that Bank of America and legacy Countrywide will not determine to withdraw from the settlement.
Other matters
After giving effect to the settlement and the additional representations and warranties charges expected to be recorded in the second quarter of 2011, the company currently estimates that the range of possible loss with respect to non-GSE investor representations and warranties expense could be up to $5 billion over expected accruals at quarter end. After giving effect to the additional GSE representations and warranties charges expected to be taken in the second quarter of 2011, based on its past experience with the GSEs, the company believes that its remaining exposure to repurchase obligations for first-lien residential mortgage loans sold directly to the GSEs will be accounted for in the recorded liability for representations and warranties for these loans at quarter end. The company is not currently able to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss with respect to any such potential impact in excess of current reserves on future GSE provisions if the GSE behaviors change from past experience. In addition, future provisions associated with representations and warranties for both non-GSE and GSE exposures and range of loss estimates with respect to non-GSE exposures may be materially impacted if actual results are different from our assumptions regarding economic conditions, home prices and other matters, including counterparty behavior and estimated repurchase rates.

All Parties will use their reasonable best efforts to obtain Final Court Approval.
(b) . If at any time Final Court Approval of the Settlement shall become legally impossible (including by reason of the denial of Final Court Approval by a court with no possibility of further appeal or proceedings that could result in Final Court Approval), the Settlement Agreement shall be null and void and have no further effect as to the Parties except as set forth in this Subparagraph 2(b) and other provisions not specifically provided for herein as being subject to or conditioned upon Final Court Approval. In such event: (i) except as provided in Paragraph 7, the Parties hereto shall be deemed to have reverted to their respective status as to all claims, positions, defenses, and responses as of the date a day prior to the Signing Date, and (ii) the provisions of Paragraph 20 shall apply, along with such other provisions hereof not specifically provided for as being subject to or conditioned upon Final Court Approval.

Effect of Failure to Obtain Final Court Approval
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
December 31, 2015, then Bank of America and Countrywide shall be permitted to withdraw from this Settlement Agreement and from the Settlement with like effect as if Final Court Approval had become legally impossible but only if the Trustee consents to such withdrawal in writing if in good faith it deems such withdrawal to be in the best interests of the Covered Trusts.
(c) . As an initial step towards seeking Final Court Approval, as soon as is practicable after the Signing Date, the Trustee shall commence the Article 77 Proceeding and seek a preliminary order (the "Preliminary Order") to be entered by the Settlement Court providing for and/or requiring: (i) a form and method of notice of the Settlement and related matters to Investors (in a form and by a method agreed to after consultation with the other Parties), (ii) a deadline for the filing of written objections to the Settlement and responses thereto, (iii) a hearing date at which the Settlement Court would consider whether to enter the Final Order and Judgment, (iv) a direction that all actions subsequently filed that contain claims that would be within the release and waiver provided for in Paragraph 9 should be assigned or transferred to the justice of the Settlement Court before whom the Article 77 Proceeding is pending, and (v) ordering that the Trustee may seek direction from the Settlement Court before taking any action in respect of a Covered Trust that relates to the subject matter of the Article 77 Proceeding. At the same time as the Trustee seeks the Preliminary Order, it shall also file with the Settlement Court a petition stating its support for the Settlement Agreement.
Preliminary Order
(d) . All costs related to the giving of notice of this Settlement and related matters as part of the Article 77 Proceeding shall be borne by Bank of America and/or Countrywide.
Cost of Notice
(e) .

Federal Tax Ruling
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
determining such distributions, and (D) any monthly Master Servicing Fee Adjustment received by or otherwise credited to such Covered Trust will not cause any portion of a Covered Trust for which a REMIC election has been made in accordance with the applicable Governing Agreement to fail to qualify at any time as a REMIC, and (ii) the receipt of the Settlement Payment by the Covered Trusts and the receipt or other credit of any monthly Master Servicing Fee Adjustment by the Covered Trusts will not cause, or result in, the imposition of any taxes on the Covered Trusts or on any portion of a Covered Trust for which a REMIC election has been made in accordance with the terms of the applicable Governing Agreement. The Trustee shall cause a request for such letter ruling(s) to be submitted to the Internal Revenue Service within thirty (30) days of the Signing Date, or, if the Internal Revenue Service is not amenable to receipt of the Trustee's request for rulings within this thirty day period, as promptly as practicable thereafter, and shall use reasonable best efforts to pursue such request; such request may not be abandoned without the consent (which shall not unreasonably be withheld) of Bank of America, Countrywide, and the Institutional Investors. Bank of America and Countrywide shall use their reasonable best efforts to assist in the Trustee's preparation and pursuit of the request for the rulings. In the event that the provisions of Subparagraph 3(d)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this Settlement Agreement are modified by the Settlement Court, the Trustee shall update its request to the Internal Revenue Service to take account of such modifications, and the requirements of this Subparagraph 2(e) necessary for there to be Final Court Approval shall be deemed not to have been satisfied until there has been received private letter ruling(s) applicable to the Covered Trusts that takes account of such modifications and otherwise meets the requirements of (i) and (ii) of this Subparagraph 2(e).
(f) . Final Court Approval shall be deemed not to have been obtained unless and until there has been received at the Trustee's request an opinion of Trustee tax counsel with respect to the States of New York and California, in each case, to the same legal effect as the requested rulings described in Subparagraph 2(e)(i) and (ii). The Trustee shall use reasonable best efforts to pursue such requests for opinions; any such requests may not be abandoned without the consent (which shall not unreasonably be withheld) of Bank of America, Countrywide, and the Institutional Investors. Bank of America and Countrywide shall use their reasonable best efforts to assist in the Trustee's preparation and pursuit of the foregoing requests. In the event that the provisions of Subparagraphs 3(d)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this Settlement
State Tax Rulings or Opinions
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
Agreement are modified by the Settlement Court, the Trustee shall update its requests for such opinions to take account of such modifications, and the requirements of this Subparagraph 2(f) necessary for there to be Final Court Approval shall be deemed not to have been satisfied until each of the opinions described in this Subparagraph 2(f) is received in a form that takes account of such modifications and otherwise meets the requirements of this Subparagraph 2(f).
(g) The Parties may collectively agree, each acting in its sole discretion, to deem the requirements of Subparagraphs 2(e) ("Federal Tax Ruling") or 2(f) ("State Tax Rulings or Opinions") to have been met by the receipt of tax rulings or opinions, as the case may be, that are substantially in accord with the requirements of such Subparagraphs 2(e) or 2(f).
.
3.
Settlement Amount
(a) . If and only if Final Court Approval is obtained, Bank of America and/or Countrywide shall pay or cause to be paid eight billion five hundred million dollars ($8,500,000,000.00) (the "Settlement Payment") within one-hundred and twenty (120) days of the Approval Date, in accordance with the following provisions.
Settlement Payment
(b) . Each Covered Trust's Allocable Share of the Settlement Payment shall be wired to the Certificate Account or Collection Account for such Covered Trust by Bank of America as directed by the Trustee following determination of the Allocable Share of each Covered Trust pursuant to Subparagraph 3(c); provided, that if the Allocable Share of each Covered Trust has not been determined pursuant to Subparagraph 3(c) at the time at which the Settlement Payment is due pursuant to Subparagraph 3(a), the Settlement Payment shall be wired to a non-interest-bearing escrow account at BNY Mellon (the "Escrow Account") set up for the sole purpose of holding the Settlement Payment until the relevant Allocable Shares have been determined, at which time each Allocable Share of the Settlement Payment shall be wired from the Escrow Account to the Certificate Account or Collection Account for each applicable Covered Trust. The Parties undertake to use reasonable best efforts to enter into a reasonably satisfactory escrow agreement in the event that an Escrow Account is required, which shall include instructions regarding the payment of the Allocable Shares from the Escrow Account to the Covered Trusts by the Trustee. All of the Trustee's reasonable costs and expenses associated with performing its obligations under this Subparagraph 3(b) that exceed its ordinary costs and
Method of Payment
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
expenses as Trustee shall be borne by Bank of America and/or Countrywide. If, after the Approval Date, all or any portion of the Settlement Payment is voided or rescinded for any reason, including as a preferential or fraudulent transfer (an "Avoided Payment"), that Avoided Payment shall be treated for purposes of this Paragraph 3 as though it were not made at all (provided that written notice has been given by the Trustee to Bank of America and Countrywide and Bank of America or Countrywide has not cured, made, or restored such payment within sixty (60) days). In the event of an Avoided Payment, the BNY Mellon Parties shall have no liability to any Person whatsoever for any Avoided Payment or any liability or losses relating thereto.
(c) . The Settlement Payment shall be allocated by the Trustee amongst the Covered Trusts. The Trustee shall retain a qualified financial advisor (the "Expert") to make any determinations and perform any calculations that are required in connection with the allocation of the Settlement Payment among the Covered Trusts. For avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Subparagraph 3(c), the term "Covered Trust" shall include any Excluded Covered Trusts. To the extent that the collateral in any Covered Trust is divided by the Governing Agreements into groups of loans ("Loan Groups") so that ordinarily only certain classes of Investors benefit from the proceeds of particular Loan Groups, those Loan Groups shall be deemed to be separate Covered Trusts for purposes of the allocation and distribution methodologies set forth below. The Trustee shall instruct the Expert to apply the following allocation formula:
Allocation Formula
(i) , the Expert shall calculate the amount of net losses for each Covered Trust that have been or are estimated to be borne by that trust from its inception date to its expected date of termination as a percentage of the sum of the net losses that are estimated to be borne by all Covered Trusts from their inception dates to their expected dates of termination (such amount, the "Net Loss Percentage");
First
(ii) , the Expert shall calculate the "Allocable Share" of the Settlement Payment for each Covered Trust by multiplying (A) the amount of the Settlement Payment by (B) the Net Loss Percentage for such Covered Trust, expressed as a decimal; provided that the Expert shall be entitled to make adjustments to the Allocable Share of each Covered Trust to
Second
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
ensure that the effects of rounding do not cause the sum of the Allocable Shares for all Covered Trusts to exceed the applicable Settlement Payment;
(iii) , if applicable, the Expert shall calculate the portion of the Allocable Share that relates to principal-only certificates or notes and the portion of the Allocable Share that relates to all other certificates or notes; and
Third
(iv) The Expert shall calculate the Allocable Share within ninety (90) days of the Approval Date.
(d) .
Distribution of the Allocable Shares; Increase of Balances
(i) After the Allocable Share for each Covered Trust has been deposited into the Certificate Account or Collection Account for each Covered Trust, the Trustee shall distribute it to Investors in accordance with the distribution provisions of the Governing Agreements (taking into account the Expert's determination under Subparagraph 3(c)(iii)) as though it was a Subsequent Recovery available for distribution on that distribution date (provided that if the Governing Agreement for a particular Covered Trust does not include the term "Subsequent Recovery," the Allocable Share of such Covered Trust shall be distributed as though it was unscheduled principal available for distribution on that distribution date); provided, however, that the Master Servicer shall not be entitled to receive any portion of the Allocable Share distributed to any Covered Trust, it being understood that the Master Servicer's other entitlements to payments, and to reimbursement or recovery, including of Advances and Servicing Advances, under the terms of the Governing Agreements shall not be affected by this Settlement Agreement except as expressly provided in this Subparagraph 3(d)(i) and in Subparagraph 5(c)(iv). To the extent that as a result of the distribution of the Allocable Share in a particular Covered Trust a principal payment would become payable to a class of REMIC residual interests, whether on the distribution of the Allocable Share or on any subsequent distribution date that is not the final distribution date under the Governing Agreement for such Covered Trust, such payment shall be maintained in the distribution account and the Trustee shall distribute it on the next distribution date according to the provisions of this Subparagraph 3(d)(i).
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
(ii) In addition, after the distribution of the Allocable Share to Investors pursuant to Subparagraph 3(d)(i), the Trustee will allocate the amount of the Allocable Share for that Covered Trust in the reverse order of previously allocated Realized Losses, to increase the Class Certificate Balance, Component Balance, Component Principal Balance, or Note Principal Balance, as applicable, of each class of Certificates or Notes (or Components thereof) (other than any class of REMIC residual interests) to which Realized Losses have been previously allocated, but in each case by not more than the amount of Realized Losses previously allocated to that class of Certificates or Notes (or Components thereof) pursuant to the Governing Agreements. For the avoidance of doubt, for Covered Trusts for which the Senior Credit Support Depletion Date shall have occurred prior to the allocation of the amount of the Allocable Share in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, in no event shall the foregoing allocation be deemed to reverse the occurrence of the Senior Credit Support Depletion Date in such Covered Trusts. Holders of such Certificates or Notes (or Components thereof) will not be entitled to any payment in respect of interest on the amount of such increases for any interest accrual period relating to the distribution date on which such increase occurs or any prior distribution date. Any such increase shall be applied pro rata to the Certificate Balance, Component Balance, Component Principal Balance, or Note Principal Balance of each Certificate or Note of each class. For the avoidance of doubt, this Subparagraph 3(d)(ii) is intended only to increase Class Certificate Balances, Component Balances, Component Principal Balances, and Note Principal Balances, as provided for herein, and shall not affect the distribution of the Settlement Payment provided for in Subparagraph 3(d)(i).
(iii) In no event shall the deposit or distribution of any amount hereunder into any Covered Trust be deemed to reduce the collateral losses experienced by such Covered Trust.
(iv) For any of the Covered Trusts in which there is a third-party guaranty or other financial guaranty provided for one or more tranches by an entity that has not previously released the right to seek repurchase of Mortgage Loans, notwithstanding anything else in this Settlement Agreement, Bank of America and Countrywide shall, up to the Approval Date, have the option to exclude such Covered Trust from the Settlement, unless and until an agreement is reached by Bank of America, Countrywide, and the third-party guarantor or financial-guaranty provider, pursuant to which the third-party guarantor or financial guaranty provider agrees not to make any
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
repurchase demands with relation to that Covered Trust. In the event that a Covered Trust is excluded under this Subparagraph 3(d)(iv), it shall be treated in accordance with Subparagraph 4(a).
(v) Nothing in Subparagraphs 3(d)(i), (ii), or (iii) is intended to or shall be construed to amend any Governing Agreements; a modification of Subparagraphs 3(d)(i), (ii), or (iii) (in each case in a manner consistent with the Governing Agreements) by the Settlement Court shall not constitute a material change to the terms of this Settlement Agreement.
(vi) The Trustee shall administer the distribution of the Allocable Shares pursuant to this Settlement Agreement and the Governing Agreements. Under no circumstances shall Bank of America or Countrywide have any liability to the Trustee, the Investors, the Covered Trusts, or any other Person in connection with such determination, administration, or distribution (including distribution within each Covered Trust) of the Allocable Shares, including under any indemnification obligation provided for in any Governing Agreement (including as clarified by the side-letter attached as Exhibit C to this Settlement Agreement).
(e) . In the absence of bad faith or manifest error, the Expert's determinations and calculations in connection with the Allocable Share of each Covered Trust shall be treated as final and accepted by all Parties for purposes of Paragraph 3.
Determinations by the Expert
.
4.
Effect of Exclusion of Trusts
(a) . In the event that any Covered Trust is excluded from the Settlement (an "Excluded Covered Trust"), the Allocable Share that would otherwise become payable to that Excluded Covered Trust shall be paid to Bank of America (as a matter of convenience for allocation as between Bank of America and Countrywide as appropriate), and there shall be no obligation by any of the Bank of America Parties or the Countrywide Parties to make any payments or provide any of the benefits of the Settlement to such Excluded Covered Trust or to Investors therein, or to comply with any of the provisions of Paragraphs 5 or 6 (except as specifically provided therein) with respect to such Excluded Covered Trust. The Trustee shall not be limited in the actions that it may take with respect to any Excluded Covered Trust (subject to the provisions of Paragraphs 17 and 20).
Excluded Covered Trusts
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
(b) . In the event that one or more Covered Trusts, holding, in the aggregate, Mortgage Loans with unpaid principal balances as of the first Trustee report after the Signing Date aggregating in excess of a confidential percentage of the total unpaid principal balance of the Covered Trusts as of that date, such percentage having been provided to the Trustee by Bank of America and Countrywide prior to the execution of this Settlement Agreement, shall become Excluded Covered Trusts, Bank of America and Countrywide shall have the option, in their sole discretion, to withdraw from the Settlement with like effect as if Final Court Approval had become legally impossible. For purposes of calculating the unpaid principal balance of Excluded Covered Trusts in connection with this Subparagraph 4(b), the unpaid principal balance of Covered Trusts that become Excluded Covered Trusts at the election of Bank of America or Countrywide pursuant to Subparagraph 3(d)(iv) shall not be included.
Withdrawal From Settlement
. The Master Servicer shall implement the following servicing improvements (the "Servicing Improvements"). Material compliance with the provisions of this Paragraph 5 shall satisfy the Master Servicer's obligation to service the Mortgage Loans prudently in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Governing Agreements:
5.
Servicing
(a) . In conformity with the subservicing provisions of the Governing Agreements:
Subservicer Selection and Assignment
(i) Within thirty (30) days of the Signing Date, the Institutional Investors and the Master Servicer shall agree on a list (the "Agreed List") of no fewer than eight and no more than ten subservicers (each a "Subservicer" and together the "Subservicers") to service High Risk Loans (as defined in Subparagraph 5(b)) and submit the Agreed List to the Trustee for review. If agreed by the Institutional Investors and the Master Servicer, the Master Servicer or an affiliate of the Master Servicer may serve as a Subservicer (in addition to the eight to ten to be otherwise agreed) and be included on the Agreed List. Within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the Agreed List, the Trustee, after consulting with an expert of its choice (whose advice shall be deemed full and complete authorization and protection in respect of the Trustee's decision), may object to any of the Subservicers on the Agreed List or reduce the maximum number of Mortgage Loans from the Covered Trusts that any such Subservicer may service at any one time to less than
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
30,000; provided that the Trustee may object to a Subservicer, or reduce the maximum number of Mortgage Loans from the Covered Trusts that any such Subservicer may service at any one time, only on the grounds listed in Exhibit D hereto and none other. The Trustee shall act in good faith in its approval decisions and shall include in any decision to object to a particular Subservicer the grounds for such objection. In the absence of an objection by the Trustee, all of the Subservicers on the Agreed List shall be deemed to be approved. If the Trustee objects to one or more Subservicers, all of the Subservicers on the Agreed List as to which there has been no objection shall be deemed approved. The Subservicers approved, or deemed approved, by the Trustee shall make up the "Approved List."
(ii) If the Trustee objects to a Subservicer on the Agreed List, or if a Subservicer on the Approved List at any time fails to meet, or ceases to meet, any of the qualifications described in Subparagraph 5(a)(iii), the Master Servicer shall remove such Subservicer from the Agreed List and/or the Approved List, as applicable, and may: (A) propose to replace any such Subservicer with a new subservicer by written notice to the Trustee, subject to such new subservicer meeting the qualifications described in Subparagraph 5(a)(iii) or (B) if applicable, re-submit such Subservicer to the Trustee for approval, provided that the Master Servicer has a commercially reasonable basis for believing that the grounds for the Trustee's objection to the subservicer are no longer applicable. Within fourteen (14) days of receipt of such notice or re-submission, the Trustee, after consulting with an expert of its choice (whose advice shall be deemed full and complete authorization and protection in respect of the Trustee's decision), may object to the proposed subservicer or reduce the maximum number of Mortgage Loans from the Covered Trusts that such proposed subservicer may service at any one time to less than 30,000; provided that the Trustee may object to a proposed subservicer or reduce the maximum number of Mortgage Loans from the Covered Trusts only on the grounds listed in Exhibit D hereto and none other. In the absence of an objection, the proposed subservicer shall be deemed approved and included on the Approved List. If the Trustee objects to a proposed subservicer, the Master Servicer may propose another subservicer pursuant to the process set out above, which process may be repeated multiple times. If the Trustee, pursuant to this Subparagraph 5(a)(ii), reduces the maximum number of Mortgage Loans that a Subservicer may service at any one time to less than 30,000, the Master Servicer may request from time to time that the Trustee lift or revise any such reduction of the maximum number of Mortgage Loans that that Subservicer may service
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
(subject to the maximum of 30,000 outstanding Mortgage Loans at any one time established by this Paragraph 5), and the Trustee, after consulting with an expert of its choice (whose advice shall be deemed full and complete authorization and protection in respect of the Trustee's decision), may agree or disagree, provided that the Trustee shall make such decision only on the grounds listed in Exhibit D hereto and none other. Nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the Master Servicer to obtain the Trustee's approval prior to terminating a Subservicer for cause.
(iii) To qualify for the transfer of loans for subservicing, a Subservicer must: (1) possess and maintain all material state and local licenses and registrations and be qualified to do business in the relevant jurisdictions, (2) agree to comply, and comply, with any laws, regulations, orders, mandates, or rulings of any Governmental Authority and/or any agreement or settlement between the Master Servicer or any of the other Bank of America Parties with any Governmental Authority applicable to subservicing, (3) maintain sufficient capable staff and facilities located in the United States, agree to meet, and meet, specified service level and performance requirements, and meet reasonable financial criteria, (4) agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Master Servicer for any servicing failures or breaches committed by it, (5) be eligible to service in accordance with the Home Affordable Modification Program ("HAMP") either pursuant to a Servicer Participation Agreement or an Assignment and Assumption Agreement with the U.S. Department of Treasury, (6) meet, and otherwise be subject to, all relevant third-party provider requirements of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, (7) meet, and otherwise be subject to, the Master Servicer's vendor management policies, provided that such policies are of general application and do not address the specific requirements for performance under this Settlement Agreement, any agreement for the transfer of loans to subservicing, or any agreement for the sale of servicing rights, and (8) otherwise meet the requirements of the subservicing provisions of the Governing Agreements. In determining whether a Subservicer meets the qualifications described in this Subparagraph 5(a)(iii), the Master Servicer shall act in good faith and shall use commercially reasonable standards. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Settlement Agreement, the Master Servicer shall have no obligation to, and shall not, enter into a subservicing contract with, or transfer any Mortgage Loan for subservicing to, any Subservicer that does not meet the qualifications described in this Subparagraph 5(a)(iii) at the relevant time. Any Subservicer on the Approved

List that, at any time, does not meet the qualifications described in this Subparagraph 5(a)(iii) and that subsequently has a commercially reasonable basis for believing that it can meet the qualifications described in this Subparagraph 5(a)(iii), can request that the Master Servicer re-evaluate whether it meets the qualifications described in this Subparagraph 5(a)(iii), and if the Master Servicer determines that the Subservicer meets the qualifications described in this Subparagraph 5(a)(iii), such Subservicer shall be considered eligible for the transfer of High Risk Loans (subject to, if applicable, negotiation of a subservicing contract pursuant to Subparagraph 5(a)(iv)).
(iv) Beginning on the date of the Trustee's approval (or deemed approval, as applicable) of at least four Subservicers, the Master Servicer shall negotiate a servicing contract that includes commercially reasonable terms (including without limitation the right to terminate the Subservicer for cause) and map the computer-transfer of Mortgage Loans with not less than one Subservicer per quarter until all of the Subservicers on the Approved List are operational. The terms on which the Subservicers are compensated shall be commercially reasonable pool-performance incentives and/or activity-based incentives substantially similar to, and not materially less favorable than, those set forth on Exhibit E hereto. The servicing contract with each Subservicer shall prohibit the Subservicer from subcontracting the servicing, subservicing, selling the servicing rights, or otherwise transferring the servicing rights of any of the High Risk Loans to another party, provided that nothing herein shall be construed to limit the right of the Subservicers to engage third-party vendors or subcontractors to perform tasks that prudent mortgage banking institutions commonly engage third party vendors or subcontractors to perform with respect to mortgage loans and related property, including, but not limited to, tax monitoring, insurance monitoring, property inspection, reconveyance, services provided by licensed field agents, and brokering REO property ("Routinely Outsourced Tasks").
(v) The Master Servicer will complete the contract negotiation and computer-transfer mapping for each Subservicer in a three-month time period running from the commencement of computer-transfer mapping with that Subservicer, provided, however, that the Master Servicer shall have no obligation to contract with any Subservicer that does not meet the qualifications described in Subparagraph 5(a)(iii) or on terms that are not commercially reasonable, and shall incur no liability whatsoever nor be subject to any other form of remedy if it cannot comply with
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
any provision of this Paragraph 5 because it is unable to contract with such a Subservicer on commercially reasonable terms (provided, however, that the other provisions of this Paragraph 5 shall remain in force).
(vi) If the Master Servicer exceeds the three month time frame to complete the required computer mapping specified in Subparagraph 5(a)(v), the Master Servicer shall retain a competent third party, at its own expense, to complete the computer mapping as soon as reasonably practical (and shall have no other liability for exceeding the time frame provided that it retains such third party and proceeds diligently to complete the computer mapping).
(vii) After at least one Subservicer is operational, the Master Servicer shall initiate the transfer of Mortgage Loans to at least one Subservicer per quarter; provided, however, that each Subservicer shall have no more than 30,000 outstanding Mortgage Loans from the Covered Trusts at any one time. If each operational Subservicer has 30,000 outstanding Mortgage Loans from the Covered Trusts (or such lesser maximum number as the Trustee directs pursuant to Subparagraphs 5(a)(i) and (ii), as applicable), the Master Servicer shall have no obligation to transfer any Mortgage Loans until such time as an operational Subservicer has enough less than 30,000 outstanding Mortgage Loans from the Covered Trusts (or such lesser maximum number as the Trustee directs pursuant to Subparagraphs 5(a)(i) and (ii), as applicable) so as to make a transfer of Mortgage Loans commercially reasonable.
(viii) Only one Subservicer shall be assigned to each Covered Trust.
(ix) Any Mortgage Loan in subservicing for which twelve (12) consecutive timely payments have been made by or on behalf of the borrower shall be transferred back to the Master Servicer. The Master Servicer shall include a provision to this effect in the subservicing contract with each Subservicer. This provision shall not apply to any Mortgage Loan for which the Master Servicer has sold the servicing rights.
(x) All costs associated with implementation of these subservicing provisions shall be borne by the Master Servicer and/or the Subservicers, as applicable; provided, however, that the costs of the Subservicer compensation described in Subparagraph 5(a)(iv) and on Exhibit E hereto shall be borne by the Master Servicer. For the avoidance of doubt, if a Mortgage Loan is
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
transferred to subservicing, the Master Servicer shall retain all rights to receive payment for accrued but unpaid Master Servicing Fees and to be reimbursed for outstanding Advances at the same time and in the same manner as if the Master Servicer had retained the servicing function.
(xi) Beginning on the date of the Trustee's approval or deemed approval of at least four Subservicers, the Master Servicer may, at its option, sell the servicing rights on High Risk Loans to any Subservicer on the Approved List, provided that: (1) such sale complies with the applicable provisions of the applicable Governing Agreements; (2) the Subservicer possesses all material state and local licenses and registrations and is qualified to do business in the relevant jurisdictions; (3) the Subservicer maintains sufficient capable staff and facilities located in the United States, meets specified service level and performance requirements, and meets reasonable financial criteria; (4) the Subservicer complies with applicable laws, regulations, orders, mandates, or rulings of any Governmental Authority; (5) the Master Servicer ensures that the terms of the contract of sale include terms not materially less favorable than, similar to, and designed to substantially maintain the effect of, the commercially reasonable pool performance incentives and/or activity-based incentives set forth on Exhibit E hereto; (6) the total number of outstanding Mortgage Loans from the Covered Trusts serviced by any Subservicer, whether as a result of a sale of servicing rights or of a transfer to subservicing, shall not exceed 30,000 at any one time; (7) the Master Servicer covenants to provide Advance financing on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise guarantee such payment, if necessary to ensure the creditworthiness of the Subservicer in connection with Advances; (8) the Master Servicer ensures that the terms of the contract of sale prohibit the Subservicer from subcontracting the servicing, subservicing, selling the servicing rights, or otherwise transferring the servicing rights of any of the High Risk Loans to another party, provided that the Master Servicer is not required to restrict the Subservicer's ability to engage third-party vendors or subcontractors to perform Routinely Outsourced Tasks; (9) the Master Servicer shall enforce its rights under any contract of sale in good faith; (10) the Master Servicer ensures that the terms of the contract of sale include provisions similar to, and that are designed to substantially maintain the effect of, Subparagraphs 5(d) and 5(e); and (11) the Master Servicer obtains whatever powers of attorney may be necessary from the Trustee (which power of attorney shall not be unreasonably withheld) and the Subservicer so that the Master Servicer may cure document exceptions and comply with its obligations pursuant to Paragraph 6. For the avoidance of doubt, (1) nothing in this
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
Settlement Agreement shall limit in any way the Master Servicer's rights, if any, under the Governing Agreements, to sell servicing rights on current Mortgage Loans; (2) the Master Servicer's sale of servicing rights in conformity with this Subparagraph 5(a)(xi) shall be the equivalent of transferring High Risk Loans to subservicing for the purposes of satisfying the obligation of the Master Servicer under this Paragraph 5 to transfer High Risk Loans; and (3) in any quarter in which the Master Servicer is obligated to transfer High Risk Loans to subservicing, the Master Servicer shall remain obligated to do so unless it sells servicing rights on High Risk Loans pursuant to this Subparagraph 5(a)(xi).
(xii) Nothing in this Settlement Agreement shall limit in any way the Master Servicer's right to sell, transfer, or assign the servicing rights for the loans in the Covered Trusts, including High Risk Loans, to a bank affiliate of the Master Servicer reasonably expected to be capable of performing the obligations of the Master Servicer under this Settlement Agreement and the Governing Agreements, and the provisions of Subparagraph 5(a)(xi) shall not apply to such a sale, transfer, or assignment. Upon the sale, transfer, or assignment of servicing rights for any loans in the Covered Trusts to such a bank affiliate of the Master Servicer, it shall be deemed to be a Master Servicer for purposes of this Settlement Agreement and all provisions of this Settlement Agreement applicable to the Master Servicer shall be fully applicable to it.
(b) . Mortgage Loans in groups (i) through (v) below shall be termed "High Risk Loans" for the purposes of this Settlement Agreement. High Risk Loans shall be transferred to subservicing in the following priority, provided that Mortgage Loans from groups (i), (ii), and (iii) below may be grouped together for transfer and treated as a single group for priority purposes:
Subservicing Implementation for High Risk Loans
(i) Mortgage Loans that are 45+ days past due without right party contact (, the Master Servicer has not succeeded in speaking with the borrower about resolution of a delinquency);
i.e.
(ii) Mortgage Loans that are 60+ days past due and that have been delinquent more than once in any rolling twelve (12) month period;

(iv) Mortgage Loans in the foreclosure process that do not yet have a scheduled sale date; and
(v) Mortgage Loans where the borrower has declared bankruptcy regardless of days past due.
(c) . Beginning five (5) months after the Signing Date or on the Approval Date, whichever is later, the servicing improvements set forth below shall apply to all Mortgage Loans that are (i) in subservicing pursuant to Subparagraphs 5(a) and 5(b) or (ii) for which the servicing rights have not been sold to a Subservicer; except that for Mortgage Loans secured by collateral in the state of Florida, the Industry Standard benchmark set forth in Subparagraph 5(c)(i)(B) and any associated Master Servicing Fee Adjustment shall not apply until the Approval Date or until twenty-four (24) months after the Signing Date, whichever is later; provided, however, that the Master Servicer shall have no liability under this Subparagraph 5(c) until such time as eight Subservicers have been approved or been deemed approved by the Trustee.
Servicing Improvements for Mortgage Loans in Subservicing

(i) The Master Servicer shall, on a monthly basis, benchmark its performance against the following industry standards (the "Industry Standards"). For the avoidance of doubt, only one Industry Standard shall apply to each Mortgage Loan:
(A) : Delinquency status of borrower at time of referral to the Master Servicer's foreclosure process: 150 days. This benchmark will exclude for each Mortgage Loan all time periods during which the borrower is in bankruptcy.
First-lien Mortgage Loans Only
(B) : Time period between referral to the Master Servicer's foreclosure process and foreclosure sale or other liquidation event: The relevant state timeline in the most current (as of the time of each calculation) FHFA referral to foreclosure timelines. This benchmark will exclude for each Mortgage Loan all time periods during which

(a) the borrower is in bankruptcy or (b) the borrower is performing pursuant to HAMP or other loss mitigation efforts mandated by Law.
(C) : Delinquency status of borrower at the time of reporting of charge-off to Trustee: Standards in relevant Governing Agreement.
Second-lien Mortgage Loans Only
(ii) The Master Servicer shall, once a month on the last business day of the month, send to the Trustee statistics for each Covered Trust comparing its performance for the prior month with respect to the Mortgage Loans in each Covered Trust to the Industry Standards (the "Monthly Statement"). The Trustee shall use reasonable commercial efforts to make such statement available on its Global Corporate Trust Investor Reporting website (https://www.gctinvestorreporting.bnymellon.com or any successor thereto) within five (5) business days of its receipt of such Monthly Statement.
(iii) Once a month, in connection with the preparation of the Monthly Statement, the Master Servicer shall calculate for the prior month: (a) a Compensatory Fee (as defined below) for each Mortgage Loan in each Covered Trust; (b) a Loan Level Amount (as defined below) for each Mortgage Loan in each Covered Trust; (c) whether there is a Master Servicing Fee Adjustment (as defined below) owed for each Covered Trust; and shall report to the Trustee as a line item on the Monthly Statement the Master Servicing Fee Adjustment, if any, for the relevant Covered Trust. The "Compensatory Fee" for a Mortgage Loan shall be calculated by multiplying the coupon applicable to that Mortgage Loan times the unpaid principal balance for that Mortgage Loan, and dividing the product of those two numbers by twelve (12). The "Loan Level Amount" for each Mortgage Loan shall be the amount equal to the applicable percentage in the applicable table below of the Compensatory Fee for such Mortgage Loan. The "Master Servicing Fee Adjustment" for each Covered Trust shall be the greater of zero and the sum of all the Loan Level Amounts for all the Mortgage Loans in such Covered Trust for that month.

(iv) For each Covered Trust other than CWHEQ 2006-A and CWHEQ 2007-G, the Master Servicer shall, on a monthly basis, deduct the Master Servicing Fee Adjustment from unreimbursed Advances due to it. For each of CWHEQ 2006-A and CWHEQ 2007-G, the Master Servicer shall, on a monthly basis, wire the Master Servicing Fee Adjustment to the Collection Account for the applicable Covered Trust and the Trustee shall distribute the Master Servicing Fee Adjustment in the same manner as is specified for an Allocable Share pursuant to Subparagraph 3(d)(i), provided, however, that the provisions of Subparagraph 3(d)(ii) shall not apply to Master Servicing Fee Adjustments.
(d) . Beginning on the Signing Date, for each borrower with a Mortgage Loan in the Covered Trusts that is considered for modification programs, the Master Servicer and/or each of the Subservicers, as applicable, shall simultaneously evaluate the borrower's eligibility for all applicable modification programs in accordance with the factors set forth in Subparagraph 5(e) (including, as applicable, HAMP and proprietary modification programs, which programs may, pursuant to the Governing Agreements, include principal reductions), and shall render a decision within sixty (60) days of receiving all requested documents from the borrower; provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to create an obligation on the part of Master Servicer to offer any modification or loss mitigation strategy to any borrower.
Loss Mitigation Requirements Applicable to All Loans
(e) . In considering modifications and/or other loss mitigation strategies, including, without limitation, short sales and deeds in lieu of foreclosure, the Master Servicer and all Subservicers shall consider the following factors: (a) the net present value of the Mortgage Loan at the time the modification and/or other loss mitigation strategy is
Loss Mitigation Considerations
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
considered and whether the contemplated modification and/or other loss mitigation strategy would have a positive effect on the net present value of the Mortgage Loan as compared to foreclosure; (b) where loan performance is the goal, whether the modification and/or other loss mitigation strategy is reasonably likely to return the Mortgage Loan to permanently performing status; (c) whether the borrower has the ability to pay, but has defaulted strategically or is otherwise acting strategically; (d) reasonably available avenues of recovery of the full principal balance of the Mortgage Loan other than foreclosure or liquidation of the loan; (e) the requirements of the applicable Governing Agreement; (f) such other factors as would be deemed prudent in its judgment; and (g) all requirements imposed by applicable Law. When the Master Servicer and/or Subservicer, in implementing a modification and/or other loss mitigation strategy (which may, pursuant to the Governing Agreements, include principal reductions), considers the factors set forth above, and/or acts in accordance with the policies or practices that the Master Servicer is then applying to its or any of its affiliates' "held for investment" portfolios, the Master Servicer shall be deemed to be in compliance with its obligation to service the Mortgage Loans prudently in keeping with the relevant servicing provisions of the relevant Governing Agreement and the requirements of this Subparagraph 5(e), the modification and/or other loss mitigation strategy so implemented shall be deemed to be permissible under the terms of the applicable Governing Agreement, and the judgments in applying such factors to a particular loan shall not be subject to challenge under the applicable Governing Agreement, this Settlement Agreement, or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything else in this Subparagraph 5(e), no principal modification by the Master Servicer or any Subservicer shall reduce the principal amount due on any Mortgage Loan below the current market value of the property, as determined by a third-party broker price opinion, using a fair market value method, applying normal marketing time criteria and excluding REO or short sale comparative sales in the valuation calculation.
(f) . Beginning on the Approval Date, the Master Servicer shall: (i) report monthly to the Trustee, for each Covered Trust, concerning its compliance with the Servicing Improvements required by this Settlement Agreement (the "Monthly Report"); and (ii) pay for an annual attestation report for the Covered Trusts as a group (the "Attestation Report") to be completed no later than February 15 of each year that any Covered Trust holds Mortgage Loans (or owns real estate related to liquidated Mortgage Loans). The Trustee shall use reasonable commercial efforts to make such

(i) The Attestation Report shall be prepared by an audit firm selected in accordance with the following selection process: (A) the Master Servicer shall propose in writing to the Trustee an audit firm meeting the qualifications described in Subparagraph 5(f)(ii); (B) within seven (7) business days of receipt of such written notice, the Trustee may object to the Master Servicer's selection if it reasonably determines that the proposed audit firm does not meet the qualifications described in Subparagraph 5(f)(ii); (C) if the Trustee objects to a proposed audit firm in accordance with Subparagraph 5(f)(i)(B) above, a different audit firm shall be selected by repeating the process set out in Subparagraphs 5(f)(i)(A) and 5(f)(i)(B) above; and (D) in the absence of an objection by the Trustee within the time frame set out in Subparagraph 5(f)(i)(B) above, the proposed audit firm shall be deemed approved.
(ii) To qualify to prepare the Attestation Report, a firm must (A) possess sufficient relevant expertise in the mortgage loan servicing industry; (B) be duly licensed to conduct its business in all relevant jurisdictions; (C) not be indicted in any state; and (D) not be engaged by Bank of America, Countrywide, or any of their respective subsidiaries and affiliates for any major engagement.
(iii) The Attestation Report shall be distributed to all Investors as part of the Trustee's Monthly Statement for April of each year, provided that the Trustee shall not be required to execute, sign, or deliver to the audit firm any consent, acknowledgement, or other documentation whatsoever in connection with its receipt of the Attestation Report or the making of the Attestation Report available to the Investors.
(g) . Nothing in this Paragraph 5 is, or shall be construed to be, an amendment of any Governing Agreement.
No Amendment
(h) . The Master Servicer shall: (i) have no liability (and shall be subject to no other remedy) to the Covered Trusts, the Trustee, or the Investors under any part of this Settlement Agreement or under the provisions of the Governing Agreements that

relate to the matters and aspects of servicing addressed in whole or in part by the provisions of this Paragraph 5, including no liability for any Master Servicing Fee Adjustment, if it becomes commercially impracticable for the Master Servicer to perform its obligations under this Paragraph 5 in a manner reasonably similar to the intent thereof because any provision of this Paragraph 5 is rendered inoperative or invalid by Law and (ii) not be liable for any portion of a Master Servicing Fee Adjustment that is the result of actions mandated or required by Law.
(i) . All expenses associated with compliance with Law related to the servicing of the Mortgage Loans in the Covered Trusts shall be borne by the Master Servicer and/or the Subservicers, as applicable, provided that (i) any modification or other loss mitigation strategy that may be required or permitted by Law, and/or (ii) any Advance that is required or permitted by Law, that is permissible under the terms of this Settlement Agreement and/or the Governing Agreements shall not be deemed to be an expense associated with compliance with Law related to the servicing of the Mortgage Loans in the Covered Trusts, and any Realized Loss associated with the implementation of such modification or loss mitigation strategy shall be borne by the relevant Covered Trust.
Cost of Compliance with Law
(j) . The Master Servicer's failure to complete any task or obligation set forth in this Paragraph 5 in the time period required by this Paragraph 5 shall not be deemed a material breach of this Settlement Agreement, provided that the Master Servicer has used and is using reasonable best efforts to comply with the time periods set forth in this Paragraph 5 and that the Master Servicer completes the task or obligation in no more than 133% of the time period required by this Paragraph 5. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Subparagraph 5(j) shall affect the amount of any Master Servicing Fee Adjustment otherwise due under Subparagraph 5(c).
Effect of Failure to Meet Timelines

If Final Court Approval becomes legally impossible, then at such time, neither the Master Servicer nor the Trustee shall have any further obligations under Subparagraph 5(a) or under Subparagraph 5(b) and Subparagraphs 5(c) and 5(f) shall be null and void. Subparagraphs 5(d) and 5(e) shall remain binding upon the Master Servicer and the Trustee. As to any trust that shall become an Excluded Covered Trust, neither the Master Servicer nor the Trustee shall have

Cure of Certain Document Exceptions
(a) . Not later than six (6) weeks after the Signing Date, the Master Servicer shall submit to the Trustee an "Initial Exceptions Report Schedule" as provided for below. Subject to Paragraph 12, the Trustee shall use reasonable best efforts to make the Initial Exceptions Report Schedule available on the Trustee's Global Corporate Trust Investor Reporting website (https://www.gctinvestorreporting.bnymellon.com, or any successor thereto) within five (5) business days of its receipt of such report.
Initial Exceptions Report Schedule
(i) The Initial Exceptions Report Schedule shall be prepared in good faith, after reasonable diligence, and shall include each Mortgage Loan in the Covered Trusts (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Mortgage Loans for which the servicing rights are sold following the Signing Date) that, on the Trustee's Loan-Level Exception Reports (as defined below), is subject to both (A) a document exception relating to mortgages coded "photocopy" (CO), "copy with recording information" (CR), "document missing" (DM), "county recorded copy with comments" (IN), "certified copy not recorded" (NR), "original with comments" (OO), "unrecorded original" (OX), "pool review pending" (PR), "contract" (CONT), and "certified copy-issuer" (CI) on the Trustee's Loan-Level Exception Reports, ("Mortgage Exceptions") and (B) a document exception relating to title policies or their legal equivalent coded "document missing" (DM), "title commitment" (CM), or "preliminary title report" (PL) on the Trustee's Loan-Level Exception Reports, ("Title Policy Exceptions"), provided that it shall exclude any such Mortgage Loan registered on the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems ("MERS"). Mortgage Loans paid in full or liquidated as of the Signing Date shall not be included in the Initial Exceptions Report Schedule.
(ii) The Master Servicer may elect, in its sole discretion, to resolve any Mortgage Exception or Title Policy Exception listed on the Initial Exceptions Report Schedule, in which
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
case the Trustee shall cooperate in good faith with the Master Servicer to resolve any such Mortgage Exception or Title Policy Exception.
(iii) If any Mortgage Loan is Cured (as defined below), the Master Servicer shall promptly provide evidence of such cure to the Trustee.
(iv) "Trustee's Loan-Level Exception Reports" shall mean the loan level exception reports for the Covered Trusts provided by the Trustee to the Master Servicer on April 14, 2011, April 27, 2011, and April 28, 2011.
(b) . Beginning the first month following the month in which the Master Servicer submits the Initial Exceptions Report Schedule, the Master Servicer shall provide to the Trustee on the last business day of each month a Monthly Exceptions Report listing all Mortgage Loans on the Initial Exceptions Report Schedule exclusive of any Mortgage Loan that has been Cured and shall separately list all Mortgage Loans that have been Cured.
Monthly Exceptions Report
(i) A Mortgage Loan listed on the Initial Exceptions Report Schedule shall be considered "Cured" for all purposes if (A) either the Mortgage Exception or Title Policy Exception associated with that Mortgage Loan has been resolved, (B) the Mortgage Loan has been paid in full or otherwise satisfied as a first lien, (C) the Mortgage Loan has been liquidated as a first lien on the Mortgaged Property, or (D) pursuant to Subparagraph (6)(c), the Master Servicer has reimbursed the Covered Trust for 100% of any related Realized Loss associated with that Mortgage Loan's liquidation.
(ii) Within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of each Monthly Exceptions Report, the Trustee shall determine whether reasonable evidence has been provided in respect of each Mortgage Loan listed as Cured in such report. In the event that the Trustee determines that a decision by the Master Servicer to list a loan as Cured is not supported by reasonable evidence, after consultation with the Master Servicer regarding the reasonableness of such evidence, the Trustee shall direct the Master Servicer to issue a revised Monthly Exceptions Report. All of the Trustee's reasonable costs and expenses associated with performing its obligations under this Subparagraph 6(b)(ii) that exceed the Trustee's ordinary costs and expenses in connection with its record-keeping duties under the Governing Agreements shall be borne by the Master Servicer.
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
(iii) The Master Servicer shall continue providing Monthly Exceptions Reports until such time as all Mortgage Loans listed in the Initial Exceptions Report Schedule have been Cured.
(iv) Subject to Paragraph 12, the Trustee shall use reasonable best efforts to make each Monthly Exceptions Report available on its Global Corporate Trust Investor Reporting website (https://www.gctinvestorreporting.bnymellon.com or any successor thereto) within five (5) business days of its receipt of such report.
(c) . If, at the time of liquidation, a Mortgage Loan (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Mortgage Loans for which the servicing rights are sold following the Signing Date) is listed on the then-current Monthly Exceptions Report as having an outstanding Mortgage Exception and an outstanding Title Policy Exception, the Master Servicer shall promptly provide notice to the Trustee and shall reimburse the trust that owns the Mortgage Loan for 100% of any Realized Loss (as defined in the applicable Governing Agreements) (i) if the Master Servicer is prevented from foreclosing as a first-lien holder by reason of an outstanding Mortgage Exception and the trust is not made whole by a title policy or equivalent by reason of an outstanding Title Policy Exception within the earlier of (A) twelve (12) months after the denial of such foreclosure or (B) thirty (30) days after the Master Servicer determines that no insurance will be payable or (ii) if a court of competent jurisdiction denies foreclosure as a first-lien holder by reason of an outstanding Mortgage Exception and the trust is not made whole by a title policy or equivalent by reason of an outstanding Title Policy Exception within the earlier of (A) twelve (12) months after the denial of such foreclosure or (B) thirty (30) days after the Master Servicer determines that no insurance will be payable. In the event that the Master Servicer makes the trust whole with respect to any Mortgage Loan pursuant to this Subparagraph 6(c), the Master Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement for such make-whole payment from any proceeds that it or the trust subsequently receives from any title policy or equivalent with respect to such Mortgage Loan.
Remedy for Uncured Exceptions
(d) If Final Court Approval becomes legally impossible, then at such time, neither the Master Servicer nor the Trustee shall have any further obligations or rights under this Paragraph 6 and the remedy provisions of Subparagraph 6(c) shall be null and void. Likewise, if the trust in
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
which the Mortgage Loan is held is designated an Excluded Covered Trust pursuant to Subparagraph 4(a), then at such time, neither the Master Servicer nor the Trustee shall have any further obligations or rights under this Paragraph 6 and the remedy provisions of Subparagraph 6(c) shall be null and void with respect to such Mortgage Loan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Master Servicer may elect in its sole discretion to resolve any Mortgage Exception or Title Policy Exception that is outstanding, in which case the Trustee shall cooperate in good faith with the Master Servicer to resolve any such Mortgage Exception or Title Policy Exception.

We confirm that we view any actions taken by the Trustee in connection with its entry into the settlement in respect of Mortgage Loan repurchase and other alleged claims against the Sellers and Master Servicer relating to the transactions identified on Exhibit 1 hereto (the ""), including but not limited to the Trustee's participation in settlement negotiations, the Trustee's analysis of the Settlement, the filing by the Trustee of any petition in connection with the Settlement, the provision of notices concerning the Settlement to interested parties (including investors), and any further actions by the Trustee in support of the Settlement, including the response by the Trustee to any objections to the Settlement and any implementation of the Settlement by the Trustee (such actions together being the "") as being actions that, for purposes of the Indemnity, relate to the Sale Agreements, the applicable securities, or the performance of the Trustee's duties under the Sale Agreements.

Trustee Settlement Activities
We also confirm that we view the Institutional Investor Agreement and any letter or other correspondence from the investors or their counsel which requests that the Trustee take the Trustee Settlement Activities, or any portion thereof, as not being the equivalent of a direction from the investors for purposes of the Indemnity. We further confirm that neither the receipt by the Trustee of any such letter or other correspondence nor the entry by the Trustee into the Institutional Investor Agreement will disqualify the Trustee from receiving the benefit of either the Indemnity or the Guaranty.
Finally, we note that the Indemnity also provides, with certain exceptions expressly provided for, that "the Master Servicer covenants and agrees . . . to pay or reimburse the Trustee for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any of the provisions of [the Sale Agreement] with respect to (A) the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its counsel not associated with the closing of the issuance of the [applicable securities], (B) the reasonable compensation, expenses and disbursements of any accountant, engineer or appraiser that is not regularly employed by the Trustee, to the extent that the Trustee must engage such persons to perform acts or services [under the Sale Agreement] and (C) printing and engraving expenses in connection with preparing any Definitive [securities]."

We confirm that we view reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances otherwise within the Indemnity, if incurred or made by the Trustee in connection with the Trustee Settlement Activities, as being reimbursable by the Master Servicer under the Indemnity.
Without limiting any of the foregoing, we confirm that following the entry by the Trustee into the Settlement, Bank of America Corporation, BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP, Countrywide Financial Corporation and/or Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of the Trustee for Trustee Settlement Activities (including its reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) on a current and ongoing basis (including all accrued

manner as the Settlement Court may direct, (v) the Settlement Court enters in the Article 77 Proceeding (including in a subsequent proceeding following an appeal and remand) the Final Order and Judgment (provided that if the Settlement Court enters an order that does not conform in all material respects to the form of order attached as Exhibit B hereto, the Parties may, by the written agreement of all Parties, deem that order to be the Final Order and Judgment; and provided further that, if the Settlement Court modifies Subparagraphs 3(d)(i), (ii), or (iii) (in each case in a manner consistent with the Governing Agreements) that modification shall not be considered to be a material change to the form of order attached as Exhibit B hereto), and (vi) either the time for taking any appeal of the Final Order and Judgment has expired without such an appeal being filed or, if an appeal is taken, upon entry of an order affirming the Final Order and Judgment and when the applicable period for the appeal of such affirmance of the Final Order and Judgment has expired, or, if an appeal is taken from any decision affirming the Final Order and Judgment, upon entry of an order in such appeal finally affirming the Final Order and Judgment without right of further appeal or upon entry of any stipulation dismissing any such appeal with no right of further prosecution of the appeal (in all circumstances there being no possibility of such Final Order and Judgment being upset on appeal therefrom, or in any related appeal from an order of the Settlement Court in the Article 77 Proceeding, or in any other proceeding pending at the time when all other prerequisites for Final Court Approval are met that puts into issue the validity of the Settlement). All Parties will use their reasonable best efforts to obtain Final Court Approval.
(b) . If at any time Final Court Approval of the Settlement shall become legally impossible (including by reason of the denial of Final Court Approval by a court with no possibility of further appeal or proceedings that could result in Final Court Approval), the Settlement Agreement shall be null and void and have no further effect as to the Parties except as set forth in this Subparagraph 2(b) and other provisions not specifically provided for herein as being subject to or conditioned upon Final Court Approval. In such event: (i) except as provided in Paragraph 7, the Parties hereto shall be deemed to have reverted to their respective status as to all claims, positions, defenses, and responses as of the date a day prior to the Signing Date, and (ii) the provisions of Paragraph 20 shall apply, along with such other provisions hereof not specifically provided for as being subject to or conditioned upon Final Court Approval. If Final Court Approval has not been obtained by

EXECUTION COPY
 
December 31, 2015, then Bank of America and Countrywide shall be permitted to withdraw from this Settlement Agreement and from the Settlement with like effect as if Final Court Approval had become legally impossible but only if the Trustee consents to such withdrawal in writing if in good faith it deems such withdrawal to be in the best interests of the Covered Trusts.
(c) . As an initial step towards seeking Final Court Approval, as soon as is practicable after the Signing Date, the Trustee shall commence the Article 77 Proceeding and seek a preliminary order (the "Preliminary Order") to be entered by the Settlement Court providing for and/or requiring: (i) a form and method of notice of the Settlement and related matters to Investors (in a form and by a method agreed to after consultation with the other Parties), (ii) a deadline for the filing of written objections to the Settlement and responses thereto, (iii) a hearing date at which the Settlement Court would consider whether to enter the Final Order and Judgment, (iv) a direction that all actions subsequently filed that contain claims that would be within the release and waiver provided for in Paragraph 9 should be assigned or transferred to the justice of the Settlement Court before whom the Article 77 Proceeding is pending, and (v) ordering that the Trustee may seek direction from the Settlement Court before taking any action in respect of a Covered Trust that relates to the subject matter of the Article 77 Proceeding. At the same time as the Trustee seeks the Preliminary Order, it shall also file with the Settlement Court a petition stating its support for the Settlement Agreement.
Preliminary Order
(d) . All costs related to the giving of notice of this Settlement and related matters as part of the Article 77 Proceeding shall be borne by Bank of America and/or Countrywide.
Cost of Notice
(e) . Final Court Approval shall be deemed not to have been obtained unless and until there has been received private letter ruling(s) applicable to all of the Covered Trusts from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that: (i) the execution of, and the transactions contemplated by, this Settlement Agreement, including (A) allocation of the Settlement Payment to a Covered Trust and the methodology for determining such allocation, (B) the receipt of the Settlement Payment by a Covered Trust, (C) the distribution of the Settlement Payment by a Covered Trust to any of its Investors and the methodology for

determining such distributions, and (D) any monthly Master Servicing Fee Adjustment received by or otherwise credited to such Covered Trust will not cause any portion of a Covered Trust for which a REMIC election has been made in accordance with the applicable Governing Agreement to fail to qualify at any time as a REMIC, and (ii) the receipt of the Settlement Payment by the Covered Trusts and the receipt or other credit of any monthly Master Servicing Fee Adjustment by the Covered Trusts will not cause, or result in, the imposition of any taxes on the Covered Trusts or on any portion of a Covered Trust for which a REMIC election has been made in accordance with the terms of the applicable Governing Agreement. The Trustee shall cause a request for such letter ruling(s) to be submitted to the Internal Revenue Service within thirty (30) days of the Signing Date, or, if the Internal Revenue Service is not amenable to receipt of the Trustee's request for rulings within this thirty day period, as promptly as practicable thereafter, and shall use reasonable best efforts to pursue such request; such request may not be abandoned without the consent (which shall not unreasonably be withheld) of Bank of America, Countrywide, and the Institutional Investors. Bank of America and Countrywide shall use their reasonable best efforts to assist in the Trustee's preparation and pursuit of the request for the rulings. In the event that the provisions of Subparagraph 3(d)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this Settlement Agreement are modified by the Settlement Court, the Trustee shall update its request to the Internal Revenue Service to take account of such modifications, and the requirements of this Subparagraph 2(e) necessary for there to be Final Court Approval shall be deemed not to have been satisfied until there has been received private letter ruling(s) applicable to the Covered Trusts that takes account of such modifications and otherwise meets the requirements of (i) and (ii) of this Subparagraph 2(e).
(f) . Final Court Approval shall be deemed not to have been obtained unless and until there has been received at the Trustee's request an opinion of Trustee tax counsel with respect to the States of New York and California, in each case, to the same legal effect as the requested rulings described in Subparagraph 2(e)(i) and (ii). The Trustee shall use reasonable best efforts to pursue such requests for opinions; any such requests may not be abandoned without the consent (which shall not unreasonably be withheld) of Bank of America, Countrywide, and the Institutional Investors. Bank of America and Countrywide shall use their reasonable best efforts to assist in the Trustee's preparation and pursuit of the foregoing requests. In the event that the provisions of Subparagraphs 3(d)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this Settlement

Agreement are modified by the Settlement Court, the Trustee shall update its requests for such opinions to take account of such modifications, and the requirements of this Subparagraph 2(f) necessary for there to be Final Court Approval shall be deemed not to have been satisfied until each of the opinions described in this Subparagraph 2(f) is received in a form that takes account of such modifications and otherwise meets the requirements of this Subparagraph 2(f).
(g) The Parties may collectively agree, each acting in its sole discretion, to deem the requirements of Subparagraphs 2(e) ("Federal Tax Ruling") or 2(f) ("State Tax Rulings or Opinions") to have been met by the receipt of tax rulings or opinions, as the case may be, that are substantially in accord with the requirements of such Subparagraphs 2(e) or 2(f).

Settlement Amount
(a) . If and only if Final Court Approval is obtained, Bank of America and/or Countrywide shall pay or cause to be paid eight billion five hundred million dollars ($8,500,000,000.00) (the "Settlement Payment") within one-hundred and twenty (120) days of the Approval Date, in accordance with the following provisions.
Settlement Payment
(b) . Each Covered Trust's Allocable Share of the Settlement Payment shall be wired to the Certificate Account or Collection Account for such Covered Trust by Bank of America as directed by the Trustee following determination of the Allocable Share of each Covered Trust pursuant to Subparagraph 3(c); provided, that if the Allocable Share of each Covered Trust has not been determined pursuant to Subparagraph 3(c) at the time at which the Settlement Payment is due pursuant to Subparagraph 3(a), the Settlement Payment shall be wired to a non-interest-bearing escrow account at BNY Mellon (the "Escrow Account") set up for the sole purpose of holding the Settlement Payment until the relevant Allocable Shares have been determined, at which time each Allocable Share of the Settlement Payment shall be wired from the Escrow Account to the Certificate Account or Collection Account for each applicable Covered Trust. The Parties undertake to use reasonable best efforts to enter into a reasonably satisfactory escrow agreement in the event that an Escrow Account is required, which shall include instructions regarding the payment of the Allocable Shares from the Escrow Account to the Covered Trusts by the Trustee. All of the Trustee's reasonable costs and expenses associated with performing its obligations under this Subparagraph 3(b) that exceed its ordinary costs and
Method of Payment
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
expenses as Trustee shall be borne by Bank of America and/or Countrywide. If, after the Approval Date, all or any portion of the Settlement Payment is voided or rescinded for any reason, including as a preferential or fraudulent transfer (an "Avoided Payment"), that Avoided Payment shall be treated for purposes of this Paragraph 3 as though it were not made at all (provided that written notice has been given by the Trustee to Bank of America and Countrywide and Bank of America or Countrywide has not cured, made, or restored such payment within sixty (60) days). In the event of an Avoided Payment, the BNY Mellon Parties shall have no liability to any Person whatsoever for any Avoided Payment or any liability or losses relating thereto.
(c) . The Settlement Payment shall be allocated by the Trustee amongst the Covered Trusts. The Trustee shall retain a qualified financial advisor (the "Expert") to make any determinations and perform any calculations that are required in connection with the allocation of the Settlement Payment among the Covered Trusts. For avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Subparagraph 3(c), the term "Covered Trust" shall include any Excluded Covered Trusts. To the extent that the collateral in any Covered Trust is divided by the Governing Agreements into groups of loans ("Loan Groups") so that ordinarily only certain classes of Investors benefit from the proceeds of particular Loan Groups, those Loan Groups shall be deemed to be separate Covered Trusts for purposes of the allocation and distribution methodologies set forth below. The Trustee shall instruct the Expert to apply the following allocation formula:
Allocation Formula
(i) , the Expert shall calculate the amount of net losses for each Covered Trust that have been or are estimated to be borne by that trust from its inception date to its expected date of termination as a percentage of the sum of the net losses that are estimated to be borne by all Covered Trusts from their inception dates to their expected dates of termination (such amount, the "Net Loss Percentage");
First
(ii) , the Expert shall calculate the "Allocable Share" of the Settlement Payment for each Covered Trust by multiplying (A) the amount of the Settlement Payment by (B) the Net Loss Percentage for such Covered Trust, expressed as a decimal; provided that the Expert shall be entitled to make adjustments to the Allocable Share of each Covered Trust to
Second
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
ensure that the effects of rounding do not cause the sum of the Allocable Shares for all Covered Trusts to exceed the applicable Settlement Payment;
(iii) , if applicable, the Expert shall calculate the portion of the Allocable Share that relates to principal-only certificates or notes and the portion of the Allocable Share that relates to all other certificates or notes; and
Third
(iv) The Expert shall calculate the Allocable Share within ninety (90) days of the Approval Date.
(d) .
Distribution of the Allocable Shares; Increase of Balances
(i) After the Allocable Share for each Covered Trust has been deposited into the Certificate Account or Collection Account for each Covered Trust, the Trustee shall distribute it to Investors in accordance with the distribution provisions of the Governing Agreements (taking into account the Expert's determination under Subparagraph 3(c)(iii)) as though it was a Subsequent Recovery available for distribution on that distribution date (provided that if the Governing Agreement for a particular Covered Trust does not include the term "Subsequent Recovery," the Allocable Share of such Covered Trust shall be distributed as though it was unscheduled principal available for distribution on that distribution date); provided, however, that the Master Servicer shall not be entitled to receive any portion of the Allocable Share distributed to any Covered Trust, it being understood that the Master Servicer's other entitlements to payments, and to reimbursement or recovery, including of Advances and Servicing Advances, under the terms of the Governing Agreements shall not be affected by this Settlement Agreement except as expressly provided in this Subparagraph 3(d)(i) and in Subparagraph 5(c)(iv). To the extent that as a result of the distribution of the Allocable Share in a particular Covered Trust a principal payment would become payable to a class of REMIC residual interests, whether on the distribution of the Allocable Share or on any subsequent distribution date that is not the final distribution date under the Governing Agreement for such Covered Trust, such payment shall be maintained in the distribution account and the Trustee shall distribute it on the next distribution date according to the provisions of this Subparagraph 3(d)(i).
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
(ii) In addition, after the distribution of the Allocable Share to Investors pursuant to Subparagraph 3(d)(i), the Trustee will allocate the amount of the Allocable Share for that Covered Trust in the reverse order of previously allocated Realized Losses, to increase the Class Certificate Balance, Component Balance, Component Principal Balance, or Note Principal Balance, as applicable, of each class of Certificates or Notes (or Components thereof) (other than any class of REMIC residual interests) to which Realized Losses have been previously allocated, but in each case by not more than the amount of Realized Losses previously allocated to that class of Certificates or Notes (or Components thereof) pursuant to the Governing Agreements. For the avoidance of doubt, for Covered Trusts for which the Senior Credit Support Depletion Date shall have occurred prior to the allocation of the amount of the Allocable Share in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, in no event shall the foregoing allocation be deemed to reverse the occurrence of the Senior Credit Support Depletion Date in such Covered Trusts. Holders of such Certificates or Notes (or Components thereof) will not be entitled to any payment in respect of interest on the amount of such increases for any interest accrual period relating to the distribution date on which such increase occurs or any prior distribution date. Any such increase shall be applied pro rata to the Certificate Balance, Component Balance, Component Principal Balance, or Note Principal Balance of each Certificate or Note of each class. For the avoidance of doubt, this Subparagraph 3(d)(ii) is intended only to increase Class Certificate Balances, Component Balances, Component Principal Balances, and Note Principal Balances, as provided for herein, and shall not affect the distribution of the Settlement Payment provided for in Subparagraph 3(d)(i).
(iii) In no event shall the deposit or distribution of any amount hereunder into any Covered Trust be deemed to reduce the collateral losses experienced by such Covered Trust.
(iv) For any of the Covered Trusts in which there is a third-party guaranty or other financial guaranty provided for one or more tranches by an entity that has not previously released the right to seek repurchase of Mortgage Loans, notwithstanding anything else in this Settlement Agreement, Bank of America and Countrywide shall, up to the Approval Date, have the option to exclude such Covered Trust from the Settlement, unless and until an agreement is reached by Bank of America, Countrywide, and the third-party guarantor or financial-guaranty provider, pursuant to which the third-party guarantor or financial guaranty provider agrees not to make any
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
repurchase demands with relation to that Covered Trust. In the event that a Covered Trust is excluded under this Subparagraph 3(d)(iv), it shall be treated in accordance with Subparagraph 4(a).
(v) Nothing in Subparagraphs 3(d)(i), (ii), or (iii) is intended to or shall be construed to amend any Governing Agreements; a modification of Subparagraphs 3(d)(i), (ii), or (iii) (in each case in a manner consistent with the Governing Agreements) by the Settlement Court shall not constitute a material change to the terms of this Settlement Agreement.
(vi) The Trustee shall administer the distribution of the Allocable Shares pursuant to this Settlement Agreement and the Governing Agreements. Under no circumstances shall Bank of America or Countrywide have any liability to the Trustee, the Investors, the Covered Trusts, or any other Person in connection with such determination, administration, or distribution (including distribution within each Covered Trust) of the Allocable Shares, including under any indemnification obligation provided for in any Governing Agreement (including as clarified by the side-letter attached as Exhibit C to this Settlement Agreement).
(e) . In the absence of bad faith or manifest error, the Expert's determinations and calculations in connection with the Allocable Share of each Covered Trust shall be treated as final and accepted by all Parties for purposes of Paragraph 3.

Effect of Exclusion of Trusts
(a) . In the event that any Covered Trust is excluded from the Settlement (an "Excluded Covered Trust"), the Allocable Share that would otherwise become payable to that Excluded Covered Trust shall be paid to Bank of America (as a matter of convenience for allocation as between Bank of America and Countrywide as appropriate), and there shall be no obligation by any of the Bank of America Parties or the Countrywide Parties to make any payments or provide any of the benefits of the Settlement to such Excluded Covered Trust or to Investors therein, or to comply with any of the provisions of Paragraphs 5 or 6 (except as specifically provided therein) with respect to such Excluded Covered Trust. The Trustee shall not be limited in the actions that it may take with respect to any Excluded Covered Trust (subject to the provisions of Paragraphs 17 and 20).
Excluded Covered Trusts
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
(b) . In the event that one or more Covered Trusts, holding, in the aggregate, Mortgage Loans with unpaid principal balances as of the first Trustee report after the Signing Date aggregating in excess of a confidential percentage of the total unpaid principal balance of the Covered Trusts as of that date, such percentage having been provided to the Trustee by Bank of America and Countrywide prior to the execution of this Settlement Agreement, shall become Excluded Covered Trusts, Bank of America and Countrywide shall have the option, in their sole discretion, to withdraw from the Settlement with like effect as if Final Court Approval had become legally impossible. For purposes of calculating the unpaid principal balance of Excluded Covered Trusts in connection with this Subparagraph 4(b), the unpaid principal balance of Covered Trusts that become Excluded Covered Trusts at the election of Bank of America or Countrywide pursuant to Subparagraph 3(d)(iv) shall not be included.
Withdrawal From Settlement
. The Master Servicer shall implement the following servicing improvements (the "Servicing Improvements"). Material compliance with the provisions of this Paragraph 5 shall satisfy the Master Servicer's obligation to service the Mortgage Loans prudently in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Governing Agreements:
5.
Servicing
(a) . In conformity with the subservicing provisions of the Governing Agreements:
Subservicer Selection and Assignment
(i) Within thirty (30) days of the Signing Date, the Institutional Investors and the Master Servicer shall agree on a list (the "Agreed List") of no fewer than eight and no more than ten subservicers (each a "Subservicer" and together the "Subservicers") to service High Risk Loans (as defined in Subparagraph 5(b)) and submit the Agreed List to the Trustee for review. If agreed by the Institutional Investors and the Master Servicer, the Master Servicer or an affiliate of the Master Servicer may serve as a Subservicer (in addition to the eight to ten to be otherwise agreed) and be included on the Agreed List. Within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the Agreed List, the Trustee, after consulting with an expert of its choice (whose advice shall be deemed full and complete authorization and protection in respect of the Trustee's decision), may object to any of the Subservicers on the Agreed List or reduce the maximum number of Mortgage Loans from the Covered Trusts that any such Subservicer may service at any one time to less than
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
30,000; provided that the Trustee may object to a Subservicer, or reduce the maximum number of Mortgage Loans from the Covered Trusts that any such Subservicer may service at any one time, only on the grounds listed in Exhibit D hereto and none other. The Trustee shall act in good faith in its approval decisions and shall include in any decision to object to a particular Subservicer the grounds for such objection. In the absence of an objection by the Trustee, all of the Subservicers on the Agreed List shall be deemed to be approved. If the Trustee objects to one or more Subservicers, all of the Subservicers on the Agreed List as to which there has been no objection shall be deemed approved. The Subservicers approved, or deemed approved, by the Trustee shall make up the "Approved List."
(ii) If the Trustee objects to a Subservicer on the Agreed List, or if a Subservicer on the Approved List at any time fails to meet, or ceases to meet, any of the qualifications described in Subparagraph 5(a)(iii), the Master Servicer shall remove such Subservicer from the Agreed List and/or the Approved List, as applicable, and may: (A) propose to replace any such Subservicer with a new subservicer by written notice to the Trustee, subject to such new subservicer meeting the qualifications described in Subparagraph 5(a)(iii) or (B) if applicable, re-submit such Subservicer to the Trustee for approval, provided that the Master Servicer has a commercially reasonable basis for believing that the grounds for the Trustee's objection to the subservicer are no longer applicable. Within fourteen (14) days of receipt of such notice or re-submission, the Trustee, after consulting with an expert of its choice (whose advice shall be deemed full and complete authorization and protection in respect of the Trustee's decision), may object to the proposed subservicer or reduce the maximum number of Mortgage Loans from the Covered Trusts that such proposed subservicer may service at any one time to less than 30,000; provided that the Trustee may object to a proposed subservicer or reduce the maximum number of Mortgage Loans from the Covered Trusts only on the grounds listed in Exhibit D hereto and none other. In the absence of an objection, the proposed subservicer shall be deemed approved and included on the Approved List. If the Trustee objects to a proposed subservicer, the Master Servicer may propose another subservicer pursuant to the process set out above, which process may be repeated multiple times. If the Trustee, pursuant to this Subparagraph 5(a)(ii), reduces the maximum number of Mortgage Loans that a Subservicer may service at any one time to less than 30,000, the Master Servicer may request from time to time that the Trustee lift or revise any such reduction of the maximum number of Mortgage Loans that that Subservicer may service
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
(subject to the maximum of 30,000 outstanding Mortgage Loans at any one time established by this Paragraph 5), and the Trustee, after consulting with an expert of its choice (whose advice shall be deemed full and complete authorization and protection in respect of the Trustee's decision), may agree or disagree, provided that the Trustee shall make such decision only on the grounds listed in Exhibit D hereto and none other. Nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the Master Servicer to obtain the Trustee's approval prior to terminating a Subservicer for cause.
(iii) To qualify for the transfer of loans for subservicing, a Subservicer must: (1) possess and maintain all material state and local licenses and registrations and be qualified to do business in the relevant jurisdictions, (2) agree to comply, and comply, with any laws, regulations, orders, mandates, or rulings of any Governmental Authority and/or any agreement or settlement between the Master Servicer or any of the other Bank of America Parties with any Governmental Authority applicable to subservicing, (3) maintain sufficient capable staff and facilities located in the United States, agree to meet, and meet, specified service level and performance requirements, and meet reasonable financial criteria, (4) agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Master Servicer for any servicing failures or breaches committed by it, (5) be eligible to service in accordance with the Home Affordable Modification Program ("HAMP") either pursuant to a Servicer Participation Agreement or an Assignment and Assumption Agreement with the U.S. Department of Treasury, (6) meet, and otherwise be subject to, all relevant third-party provider requirements of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, (7) meet, and otherwise be subject to, the Master Servicer's vendor management policies, provided that such policies are of general application and do not address the specific requirements for performance under this Settlement Agreement, any agreement for the transfer of loans to subservicing, or any agreement for the sale of servicing rights, and (8) otherwise meet the requirements of the subservicing provisions of the Governing Agreements. In determining whether a Subservicer meets the qualifications described in this Subparagraph 5(a)(iii), the Master Servicer shall act in good faith and shall use commercially reasonable standards. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Settlement Agreement, the Master Servicer shall have no obligation to, and shall not, enter into a subservicing contract with, or transfer any Mortgage Loan for subservicing to, any Subservicer that does not meet the qualifications described in this Subparagraph 5(a)(iii) at the relevant time. Any Subservicer on the Approved
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
List that, at any time, does not meet the qualifications described in this Subparagraph 5(a)(iii) and that subsequently has a commercially reasonable basis for believing that it can meet the qualifications described in this Subparagraph 5(a)(iii), can request that the Master Servicer re-evaluate whether it meets the qualifications described in this Subparagraph 5(a)(iii), and if the Master Servicer determines that the Subservicer meets the qualifications described in this Subparagraph 5(a)(iii), such Subservicer shall be considered eligible for the transfer of High Risk Loans (subject to, if applicable, negotiation of a subservicing contract pursuant to Subparagraph 5(a)(iv)).
(iv) Beginning on the date of the Trustee's approval (or deemed approval, as applicable) of at least four Subservicers, the Master Servicer shall negotiate a servicing contract that includes commercially reasonable terms (including without limitation the right to terminate the Subservicer for cause) and map the computer-transfer of Mortgage Loans with not less than one Subservicer per quarter until all of the Subservicers on the Approved List are operational. The terms on which the Subservicers are compensated shall be commercially reasonable pool-performance incentives and/or activity-based incentives substantially similar to, and not materially less favorable than, those set forth on Exhibit E hereto. The servicing contract with each Subservicer shall prohibit the Subservicer from subcontracting the servicing, subservicing, selling the servicing rights, or otherwise transferring the servicing rights of any of the High Risk Loans to another party, provided that nothing herein shall be construed to limit the right of the Subservicers to engage third-party vendors or subcontractors to perform tasks that prudent mortgage banking institutions commonly engage third party vendors or subcontractors to perform with respect to mortgage loans and related property, including, but not limited to, tax monitoring, insurance monitoring, property inspection, reconveyance, services provided by licensed field agents, and brokering REO property ("Routinely Outsourced Tasks").
(v) The Master Servicer will complete the contract negotiation and computer-transfer mapping for each Subservicer in a three-month time period running from the commencement of computer-transfer mapping with that Subservicer, provided, however, that the Master Servicer shall have no obligation to contract with any Subservicer that does not meet the qualifications described in Subparagraph 5(a)(iii) or on terms that are not commercially reasonable, and shall incur no liability whatsoever nor be subject to any other form of remedy if it cannot comply with
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
any provision of this Paragraph 5 because it is unable to contract with such a Subservicer on commercially reasonable terms (provided, however, that the other provisions of this Paragraph 5 shall remain in force).
(vi) If the Master Servicer exceeds the three month time frame to complete the required computer mapping specified in Subparagraph 5(a)(v), the Master Servicer shall retain a competent third party, at its own expense, to complete the computer mapping as soon as reasonably practical (and shall have no other liability for exceeding the time frame provided that it retains such third party and proceeds diligently to complete the computer mapping).
(vii) After at least one Subservicer is operational, the Master Servicer shall initiate the transfer of Mortgage Loans to at least one Subservicer per quarter; provided, however, that each Subservicer shall have no more than 30,000 outstanding Mortgage Loans from the Covered Trusts at any one time. If each operational Subservicer has 30,000 outstanding Mortgage Loans from the Covered Trusts (or such lesser maximum number as the Trustee directs pursuant to Subparagraphs 5(a)(i) and (ii), as applicable), the Master Servicer shall have no obligation to transfer any Mortgage Loans until such time as an operational Subservicer has enough less than 30,000 outstanding Mortgage Loans from the Covered Trusts (or such lesser maximum number as the Trustee directs pursuant to Subparagraphs 5(a)(i) and (ii), as applicable) so as to make a transfer of Mortgage Loans commercially reasonable.
(viii) Only one Subservicer shall be assigned to each Covered Trust.
(ix) Any Mortgage Loan in subservicing for which twelve (12) consecutive timely payments have been made by or on behalf of the borrower shall be transferred back to the Master Servicer. The Master Servicer shall include a provision to this effect in the subservicing contract with each Subservicer. This provision shall not apply to any Mortgage Loan for which the Master Servicer has sold the servicing rights.
(x) All costs associated with implementation of these subservicing provisions shall be borne by the Master Servicer and/or the Subservicers, as applicable; provided, however, that the costs of the Subservicer compensation described in Subparagraph 5(a)(iv) and on Exhibit E hereto shall be borne by the Master Servicer. For the avoidance of doubt, if a Mortgage Loan is
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
transferred to subservicing, the Master Servicer shall retain all rights to receive payment for accrued but unpaid Master Servicing Fees and to be reimbursed for outstanding Advances at the same time and in the same manner as if the Master Servicer had retained the servicing function.
(xi) Beginning on the date of the Trustee's approval or deemed approval of at least four Subservicers, the Master Servicer may, at its option, sell the servicing rights on High Risk Loans to any Subservicer on the Approved List, provided that: (1) such sale complies with the applicable provisions of the applicable Governing Agreements; (2) the Subservicer possesses all material state and local licenses and registrations and is qualified to do business in the relevant jurisdictions; (3) the Subservicer maintains sufficient capable staff and facilities located in the United States, meets specified service level and performance requirements, and meets reasonable financial criteria; (4) the Subservicer complies with applicable laws, regulations, orders, mandates, or rulings of any Governmental Authority; (5) the Master Servicer ensures that the terms of the contract of sale include terms not materially less favorable than, similar to, and designed to substantially maintain the effect of, the commercially reasonable pool performance incentives and/or activity-based incentives set forth on Exhibit E hereto; (6) the total number of outstanding Mortgage Loans from the Covered Trusts serviced by any Subservicer, whether as a result of a sale of servicing rights or of a transfer to subservicing, shall not exceed 30,000 at any one time; (7) the Master Servicer covenants to provide Advance financing on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise guarantee such payment, if necessary to ensure the creditworthiness of the Subservicer in connection with Advances; (8) the Master Servicer ensures that the terms of the contract of sale prohibit the Subservicer from subcontracting the servicing, subservicing, selling the servicing rights, or otherwise transferring the servicing rights of any of the High Risk Loans to another party, provided that the Master Servicer is not required to restrict the Subservicer's ability to engage third-party vendors or subcontractors to perform Routinely Outsourced Tasks; (9) the Master Servicer shall enforce its rights under any contract of sale in good faith; (10) the Master Servicer ensures that the terms of the contract of sale include provisions similar to, and that are designed to substantially maintain the effect of, Subparagraphs 5(d) and 5(e); and (11) the Master Servicer obtains whatever powers of attorney may be necessary from the Trustee (which power of attorney shall not be unreasonably withheld) and the Subservicer so that the Master Servicer may cure document exceptions and comply with its obligations pursuant to Paragraph 6. For the avoidance of doubt, (1) nothing in this
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
Settlement Agreement shall limit in any way the Master Servicer's rights, if any, under the Governing Agreements, to sell servicing rights on current Mortgage Loans; (2) the Master Servicer's sale of servicing rights in conformity with this Subparagraph 5(a)(xi) shall be the equivalent of transferring High Risk Loans to subservicing for the purposes of satisfying the obligation of the Master Servicer under this Paragraph 5 to transfer High Risk Loans; and (3) in any quarter in which the Master Servicer is obligated to transfer High Risk Loans to subservicing, the Master Servicer shall remain obligated to do so unless it sells servicing rights on High Risk Loans pursuant to this Subparagraph 5(a)(xi).
(xii) Nothing in this Settlement Agreement shall limit in any way the Master Servicer's right to sell, transfer, or assign the servicing rights for the loans in the Covered Trusts, including High Risk Loans, to a bank affiliate of the Master Servicer reasonably expected to be capable of performing the obligations of the Master Servicer under this Settlement Agreement and the Governing Agreements, and the provisions of Subparagraph 5(a)(xi) shall not apply to such a sale, transfer, or assignment. Upon the sale, transfer, or assignment of servicing rights for any loans in the Covered Trusts to such a bank affiliate of the Master Servicer, it shall be deemed to be a Master Servicer for purposes of this Settlement Agreement and all provisions of this Settlement Agreement applicable to the Master Servicer shall be fully applicable to it.
(b) . Mortgage Loans in groups (i) through (v) below shall be termed "High Risk Loans" for the purposes of this Settlement Agreement. High Risk Loans shall be transferred to subservicing in the following priority, provided that Mortgage Loans from groups (i), (ii), and (iii) below may be grouped together for transfer and treated as a single group for priority purposes:
Subservicing Implementation for High Risk Loans

(i) The Master Servicer shall, on a monthly basis, benchmark its performance against the following industry standards (the "Industry Standards"). For the avoidance of doubt, only one Industry Standard shall apply to each Mortgage Loan:
(A) : Delinquency status of borrower at time of referral to the Master Servicer's foreclosure process: 150 days. This benchmark will exclude for each Mortgage Loan all time periods during which the borrower is in bankruptcy.
First-lien Mortgage Loans Only
(B) : Time period between referral to the Master Servicer's foreclosure process and foreclosure sale or other liquidation event: The relevant state timeline in the most current (as of the time of each calculation) FHFA referral to foreclosure timelines. This benchmark will exclude for each Mortgage Loan all time periods during which

(C) : Delinquency status of borrower at the time of reporting of charge-off to Trustee: Standards in relevant Governing Agreement.
Second-lien Mortgage Loans Only
(ii) The Master Servicer shall, once a month on the last business day of the month, send to the Trustee statistics for each Covered Trust comparing its performance for the prior month with respect to the Mortgage Loans in each Covered Trust to the Industry Standards (the "Monthly Statement"). The Trustee shall use reasonable commercial efforts to make such statement available on its Global Corporate Trust Investor Reporting website (https://www.gctinvestorreporting.bnymellon.com or any successor thereto) within five (5) business days of its receipt of such Monthly Statement.
(iii) Once a month, in connection with the preparation of the Monthly Statement, the Master Servicer shall calculate for the prior month: (a) a Compensatory Fee (as defined below) for each Mortgage Loan in each Covered Trust; (b) a Loan Level Amount (as defined below) for each Mortgage Loan in each Covered Trust; (c) whether there is a Master Servicing Fee Adjustment (as defined below) owed for each Covered Trust; and shall report to the Trustee as a line item on the Monthly Statement the Master Servicing Fee Adjustment, if any, for the relevant Covered Trust. The "Compensatory Fee" for a Mortgage Loan shall be calculated by multiplying the coupon applicable to that Mortgage Loan times the unpaid principal balance for that Mortgage Loan, and dividing the product of those two numbers by twelve (12). The "Loan Level Amount" for each Mortgage Loan shall be the amount equal to the applicable percentage in the applicable table below of the Compensatory Fee for such Mortgage Loan. The "Master Servicing Fee Adjustment" for each Covered Trust shall be the greater of zero and the sum of all the Loan Level Amounts for all the Mortgage Loans in such Covered Trust for that month.

(iv) For each Covered Trust other than CWHEQ 2006-A and CWHEQ 2007-G, the Master Servicer shall, on a monthly basis, deduct the Master Servicing Fee Adjustment from unreimbursed Advances due to it. For each of CWHEQ 2006-A and CWHEQ 2007-G, the Master Servicer shall, on a monthly basis, wire the Master Servicing Fee Adjustment to the Collection Account for the applicable Covered Trust and the Trustee shall distribute the Master Servicing Fee Adjustment in the same manner as is specified for an Allocable Share pursuant to Subparagraph 3(d)(i), provided, however, that the provisions of Subparagraph 3(d)(ii) shall not apply to Master Servicing Fee Adjustments.
(d) . Beginning on the Signing Date, for each borrower with a Mortgage Loan in the Covered Trusts that is considered for modification programs, the Master Servicer and/or each of the Subservicers, as applicable, shall simultaneously evaluate the borrower's eligibility for all applicable modification programs in accordance with the factors set forth in Subparagraph 5(e) (including, as applicable, HAMP and proprietary modification programs, which programs may, pursuant to the Governing Agreements, include principal reductions), and shall render a decision within sixty (60) days of receiving all requested documents from the borrower; provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to create an obligation on the part of Master Servicer to offer any modification or loss mitigation strategy to any borrower.
Loss Mitigation Requirements Applicable to All Loans
(e) . In considering modifications and/or other loss mitigation strategies, including, without limitation, short sales and deeds in lieu of foreclosure, the Master Servicer and all Subservicers shall consider the following factors: (a) the net present value of the Mortgage Loan at the time the modification and/or other loss mitigation strategy is
Loss Mitigation Considerations
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
considered and whether the contemplated modification and/or other loss mitigation strategy would have a positive effect on the net present value of the Mortgage Loan as compared to foreclosure; (b) where loan performance is the goal, whether the modification and/or other loss mitigation strategy is reasonably likely to return the Mortgage Loan to permanently performing status; (c) whether the borrower has the ability to pay, but has defaulted strategically or is otherwise acting strategically; (d) reasonably available avenues of recovery of the full principal balance of the Mortgage Loan other than foreclosure or liquidation of the loan; (e) the requirements of the applicable Governing Agreement; (f) such other factors as would be deemed prudent in its judgment; and (g) all requirements imposed by applicable Law. When the Master Servicer and/or Subservicer, in implementing a modification and/or other loss mitigation strategy (which may, pursuant to the Governing Agreements, include principal reductions), considers the factors set forth above, and/or acts in accordance with the policies or practices that the Master Servicer is then applying to its or any of its affiliates' "held for investment" portfolios, the Master Servicer shall be deemed to be in compliance with its obligation to service the Mortgage Loans prudently in keeping with the relevant servicing provisions of the relevant Governing Agreement and the requirements of this Subparagraph 5(e), the modification and/or other loss mitigation strategy so implemented shall be deemed to be permissible under the terms of the applicable Governing Agreement, and the judgments in applying such factors to a particular loan shall not be subject to challenge under the applicable Governing Agreement, this Settlement Agreement, or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything else in this Subparagraph 5(e), no principal modification by the Master Servicer or any Subservicer shall reduce the principal amount due on any Mortgage Loan below the current market value of the property, as determined by a third-party broker price opinion, using a fair market value method, applying normal marketing time criteria and excluding REO or short sale comparative sales in the valuation calculation.
(f) . Beginning on the Approval Date, the Master Servicer shall: (i) report monthly to the Trustee, for each Covered Trust, concerning its compliance with the Servicing Improvements required by this Settlement Agreement (the "Monthly Report"); and (ii) pay for an annual attestation report for the Covered Trusts as a group (the "Attestation Report") to be completed no later than February 15 of each year that any Covered Trust holds Mortgage Loans (or owns real estate related to liquidated Mortgage Loans). The Trustee shall use reasonable commercial efforts to make such

(ii) To qualify to prepare the Attestation Report, a firm must (A) possess sufficient relevant expertise in the mortgage loan servicing industry; (B) be duly licensed to conduct its business in all relevant jurisdictions; (C) not be indicted in any state; and (D) not be engaged by Bank of America, Countrywide, or any of their respective subsidiaries and affiliates for any major engagement.
(iii) The Attestation Report shall be distributed to all Investors as part of the Trustee's Monthly Statement for April of each year, provided that the Trustee shall not be required to execute, sign, or deliver to the audit firm any consent, acknowledgement, or other documentation whatsoever in connection with its receipt of the Attestation Report or the making of the Attestation Report available to the Investors.

relate to the matters and aspects of servicing addressed in whole or in part by the provisions of this Paragraph 5, including no liability for any Master Servicing Fee Adjustment, if it becomes commercially impracticable for the Master Servicer to perform its obligations under this Paragraph 5 in a manner reasonably similar to the intent thereof because any provision of this Paragraph 5 is rendered inoperative or invalid by Law and (ii) not be liable for any portion of a Master Servicing Fee Adjustment that is the result of actions mandated or required by Law.
(i) . All expenses associated with compliance with Law related to the servicing of the Mortgage Loans in the Covered Trusts shall be borne by the Master Servicer and/or the Subservicers, as applicable, provided that (i) any modification or other loss mitigation strategy that may be required or permitted by Law, and/or (ii) any Advance that is required or permitted by Law, that is permissible under the terms of this Settlement Agreement and/or the Governing Agreements shall not be deemed to be an expense associated with compliance with Law related to the servicing of the Mortgage Loans in the Covered Trusts, and any Realized Loss associated with the implementation of such modification or loss mitigation strategy shall be borne by the relevant Covered Trust.
Cost of Compliance with Law
(j) . The Master Servicer's failure to complete any task or obligation set forth in this Paragraph 5 in the time period required by this Paragraph 5 shall not be deemed a material breach of this Settlement Agreement, provided that the Master Servicer has used and is using reasonable best efforts to comply with the time periods set forth in this Paragraph 5 and that the Master Servicer completes the task or obligation in no more than 133% of the time period required by this Paragraph 5.

Initial Exceptions Report Schedule
(i) The Initial Exceptions Report Schedule shall be prepared in good faith, after reasonable diligence, and shall include each Mortgage Loan in the Covered Trusts (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Mortgage Loans for which the servicing rights are sold following the Signing Date) that, on the Trustee's Loan-Level Exception Reports (as defined below), is subject to both (A) a document exception relating to mortgages coded "photocopy" (CO), "copy with recording information" (CR), "document missing" (DM), "county recorded copy with comments" (IN), "certified copy not recorded" (NR), "original with comments" (OO), "unrecorded original" (OX), "pool review pending" (PR), "contract" (CONT), and "certified copy-issuer" (CI) on the Trustee's Loan-Level Exception Reports, ("Mortgage Exceptions") and (B) a document exception relating to title policies or their legal equivalent coded "document missing" (DM), "title commitment" (CM), or "preliminary title report" (PL) on the Trustee's Loan-Level Exception Reports, ("Title Policy Exceptions"), provided that it shall exclude any such Mortgage Loan registered on the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems ("MERS"). Mortgage Loans paid in full or liquidated as of the Signing Date shall not be included in the Initial Exceptions Report Schedule.
(ii) The Master Servicer may elect, in its sole discretion, to resolve any Mortgage Exception or Title Policy Exception listed on the Initial Exceptions Report Schedule, in which
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
case the Trustee shall cooperate in good faith with the Master Servicer to resolve any such Mortgage Exception or Title Policy Exception.
(iii) If any Mortgage Loan is Cured (as defined below), the Master Servicer shall promptly provide evidence of such cure to the Trustee.
(iv) "Trustee's Loan-Level Exception Reports" shall mean the loan level exception reports for the Covered Trusts provided by the Trustee to the Master Servicer on April 14, 2011, April 27, 2011, and April 28, 2011.
(b) . Beginning the first month following the month in which the Master Servicer submits the Initial Exceptions Report Schedule, the Master Servicer shall provide to the Trustee on the last business day of each month a Monthly Exceptions Report listing all Mortgage Loans on the Initial Exceptions Report Schedule exclusive of any Mortgage Loan that has been Cured and shall separately list all Mortgage Loans that have been Cured.
Monthly Exceptions Report
(i) A Mortgage Loan listed on the Initial Exceptions Report Schedule shall be considered "Cured" for all purposes if (A) either the Mortgage Exception or Title Policy Exception associated with that Mortgage Loan has been resolved, (B) the Mortgage Loan has been paid in full or otherwise satisfied as a first lien, (C) the Mortgage Loan has been liquidated as a first lien on the Mortgaged Property, or (D) pursuant to Subparagraph (6)(c), the Master Servicer has reimbursed the Covered Trust for 100% of any related Realized Loss associated with that Mortgage Loan's liquidation.
(ii) Within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of each Monthly Exceptions Report, the Trustee shall determine whether reasonable evidence has been provided in respect of each Mortgage Loan listed as Cured in such report. In the event that the Trustee determines that a decision by the Master Servicer to list a loan as Cured is not supported by reasonable evidence, after consultation with the Master Servicer regarding the reasonableness of such evidence, the Trustee shall direct the Master Servicer to issue a revised Monthly Exceptions Report. All of the Trustee's reasonable costs and expenses associated with performing its obligations under this Subparagraph 6(b)(ii) that exceed the Trustee's ordinary costs and expenses in connection with its record-keeping duties under the Governing Agreements shall be borne by the Master Servicer.

(c) . If, at the time of liquidation, a Mortgage Loan (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Mortgage Loans for which the servicing rights are sold following the Signing Date) is listed on the then-current Monthly Exceptions Report as having an outstanding Mortgage Exception and an outstanding Title Policy Exception, the Master Servicer shall promptly provide notice to the Trustee and shall reimburse the trust that owns the Mortgage Loan for 100% of any Realized Loss (as defined in the applicable Governing Agreements) (i) if the Master Servicer is prevented from foreclosing as a first-lien holder by reason of an outstanding Mortgage Exception and the trust is not made whole by a title policy or equivalent by reason of an outstanding Title Policy Exception within the earlier of (A) twelve (12) months after the denial of such foreclosure or (B) thirty (30) days after the Master Servicer determines that no insurance will be payable or (ii) if a court of competent jurisdiction denies foreclosure as a first-lien holder by reason of an outstanding Mortgage Exception and the trust is not made whole by a title policy or equivalent by reason of an outstanding Title Policy Exception within the earlier of (A) twelve (12) months after the denial of such foreclosure or (B) thirty (30) days after the Master Servicer determines that no insurance will be payable. In the event that the Master Servicer makes the trust whole with respect to any Mortgage Loan pursuant to this Subparagraph 6(c), the Master Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement for such make-whole payment from any proceeds that it or the trust subsequently receives from any title policy or equivalent with respect to such Mortgage Loan.
Remedy for Uncured Exceptions
(d) If Final Court Approval becomes legally impossible, then at such time, neither the Master Servicer nor the Trustee shall have any further obligations or rights under this Paragraph 6 and the remedy provisions of Subparagraph 6(c) shall be null and void. Likewise, if the trust in
 
EXECUTION COPY
 
which the Mortgage Loan is held is designated an Excluded Covered Trust pursuant to Subparagraph 4(a), then at such time, neither the Master Servicer nor the Trustee shall have any further obligations or rights under this Paragraph 6 and the remedy provisions of Subparagraph 6(c) shall be null and void with respect to such Mortgage Loan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Master Servicer may elect in its sole discretion to resolve any Mortgage Exception or Title Policy Exception that is outstanding, in which case the Trustee shall cooperate in good faith with the Master Servicer to resolve any such Mortgage Exception or Title Policy Exception.

We confirm that we view any actions taken by the Trustee in connection with its entry into the settlement in respect of Mortgage Loan repurchase and other alleged claims against the Sellers and Master Servicer relating to the transactions identified on Exhibit 1 hereto (the ""), including but not limited to the Trustee's participation in settlement negotiations, the Trustee's analysis of the Settlement, the filing by the Trustee of any petition in connection with the Settlement, the provision of notices concerning the Settlement to interested parties (including investors), and any further actions by the Trustee in support of the Settlement, including the response by the Trustee to any objections to the Settlement and any implementation of the Settlement by the Trustee (such actions together being the "") as being actions that, for purposes of the Indemnity, relate to the Sale Agreements, the applicable securities, or the performance of the Trustee's duties under the Sale Agreements. We also confirm that the manner of entering into the Settlement or undertaking the activities to prepare therefor or contemplated thereby will not serve to disqualify the Trustee from receiving the benefits of the Indemnity or the Guaranty.

Trustee Settlement Activities
We also confirm that we view the Institutional Investor Agreement and any letter or other correspondence from the investors or their counsel which requests that the Trustee take the Trustee Settlement Activities, or any portion thereof, as not being the equivalent of a direction from the investors for purposes of the Indemnity. We further confirm that neither the receipt by the Trustee of any such letter or other correspondence nor the entry by the Trustee into the Institutional Investor Agreement will disqualify the Trustee from receiving the benefit of either the Indemnity or the Guaranty.
Finally, we note that the Indemnity also provides, with certain exceptions expressly provided for, that "the Master Servicer covenants and agrees . . . to pay or reimburse the Trustee for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any of the provisions of [the Sale Agreement] with respect to (A) the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its counsel not associated with the closing of the issuance of the [applicable securities], (B) the reasonable compensation, expenses and disbursements of any accountant, engineer or appraiser that is not regularly employed by the Trustee, to the extent that the Trustee must engage such persons to perform acts or services [under the Sale Agreement] and (C) printing and engraving expenses in connection with preparing any Definitive [securities]."

We confirm that we view reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances otherwise within the Indemnity, if incurred or made by the Trustee in connection with the Trustee Settlement Activities, as being reimbursable by the Master Servicer under the Indemnity.
Without limiting any of the foregoing, we confirm that following the entry by the Trustee into the Settlement, Bank of America Corporation, BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP, Countrywide Financial Corporation and/or Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of the Trustee for Trustee Settlement Activities (including its reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) on a current and ongoing basis (including all accrued
