Compared to the second quarter of 2010, results were driven by charges related to the recently announced agreement to resolve nearly all of the legacy Countrywide-issued first-lien non-GSE residential mortgage-backed securitization (RMBS) repurchase exposures, as well as the impact of other mortgage-related costs. These charges were partially offset by lower credit costs, gains from the sale of non-core assets and debt securities, improved sales and trading revenues and higher asset management fees and investment banking fees.
"Obviously, the solid performance in our underlying businesses continues to be clouded by the costs we are absorbing from our legacy mortgage issues," said Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan. "But it is clear that  from deposits to wealth management to investment banking  our customers and clients are choosing to do more with us every day. We intend to continue our efforts to put the mortgage uncertainty behind us, build capital through the strength of the franchise, and deliver the returns for shareholders that we owe them."

During the second quarter of 2011, the company continued to make significant progress on its operating principles, including the following developments:

Business Segment Results
Deposits
 
 
 
 
Business Highlights
 
 
Financial Overview
Deposits reported net income of $430 million, down $244 million from the year-ago quarter due to a decline in revenue driven by lower noninterest income from the impact of overdraft policy changes that were fully implemented in the third quarter of 2010.

Net interest income increased $137 million compared to the second quarter of 2010, reflecting a customer shift to more liquid products and continued pricing discipline. Noninterest expense remained flat from a year ago.
Global Card Services
 
 
 
Business Highlights
 
 
Financial Overview
Global Card Services reported net income of $2.0 billion, up $1.2 billion from the year-ago quarter as lower credit losses more than offset a $1.4 billion decline in revenue. The lower revenue reflected a drop in net interest income from lower average loans and

yields, as well as lower noninterest income due to the gain on the sale of the company's MasterCard position in the second quarter of 2010.
Provision for credit losses decreased $3.3 billion from a year ago to $481 million, reflecting improving economic conditions and continued expectations of improving delinquency, collection and bankruptcy trends.
Global Wealth and Investment Management
 
 
 
 
Business Highlights

Page 8
 
Financial Overview
Global Wealth and Investment Management's net income rose 54 percent from the year-ago quarter due to higher net interest income as a result of deposit growth, higher fee-based income, lower credit costs and the absence of a charge related to the sale of the Columbia long-term asset management business in the second quarter of 2010. These factors were partially offset by higher expenses. Revenue increased 7 percent from a year earlier to $4.5 billion, driven by the impact of deposit growth and record asset management fees, partially offset by the impact of the aforementioned sale during the year-ago quarter.
The provision for credit losses decreased $50 million from a year ago. The decrease reflected improving portfolio trends within the home equity portfolio, partially offset by the impact of declines in home prices on the residential mortgage portfolio.
Noninterest expense increased $362 million from a year ago due primarily to higher volume-driven expenses and personnel costs associated with the continued build-out of the business.
Global Commercial Banking

Business Highlights
 
 
Financial Overview
Global Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.4 billion, up $566 million from a year ago due to lower credit costs from improved asset quality. Revenue decreased $73 million from a year ago, primarily due to lower loan balances, partially offset by earnings on higher deposit balances and the gain on the termination of a purchase contract.
The provision for credit losses decreased to a benefit of $417 million, an improvement of $1.0 billion compared to the second quarter of 2010. The decrease was driven by improved overall economic conditions and an accelerated rate of loan resolutions in the commercial real estate portfolio.
Average deposit balances continued to grow, increasing by $21 billion from the year-ago quarter, as clients continued to maintain higher levels of liquidity. Although average loan and lease balances decreased $17.3 billion from a year ago due to client deleveraging, average commercial and industrial loan balances have continued to show modest growth.

Global Banking and Markets
 
 
 
Business Highlights
 
 
Financial Overview
Global Banking and Markets reported net income of $1.6 billion, up from $898 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting higher investment banking fees and increased sales and trading revenue. Although noninterest expense was relatively flat on a reported basis, the prior year period included the impact of the U.K. bonus tax. After considering this item, expenses increased from the year-ago quarter, driven by revenue-related compensation and investments in infrastructure. Compared to a seasonally strong first quarter of 2011, revenue was down $1.1 billion. Provision benefit decreased $51 million from the second quarter of 2010 due to lower reserve releases versus the prior year period.

Page 11
 
Sales and trading revenue was $3.8 billion, an increase of $666 million from the second quarter of 2010. The current period includes Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) gains of $121 million compared to gains of $77 million in the second quarter of 2010.
Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities revenues were $2.7 billion, an increase of $467 million compared to the same quarter last year, driven by increases across all lines of business other than mortgages and proprietary trading, which the company had exited as of June 30, 2011. Equities sales and trading revenues increased to $1.1 billion from $882 million due to favorable market conditions compared to the same period last year, primarily in the equity derivatives business.
Investment banking fees of $1.6 billion, excluding self-led deals, rose 28 percent in the second quarter of 2011, compared to the same period a year ago, reflecting strong performance across all categories. Approximately 23 percent of investment banking fees, excluding self-led deals, originated outside the U.S., compared to 17 percent for the same period last year.
Average loans and leases increased 14 percent from the same period a year ago to $109.5 billion, primarily as a result of originations outside the U.S. Corporate Bank which grew its loan base by 17%, reflecting the company's continued focus on international growth. Average deposits continued to grow, increasing 5 percent from the second quarter of 2010 driven by deposits in the Corporate Bank which grew by 6 percent.
Consumer Real Estate Services

Business Highlights
 
 
Financial Overview
Consumer Real Estate Services reported a net loss of $14.5 billion, compared to a net loss of $1.5 billion for the same period in 2010. Revenue declined by $14 billion, and noninterest expense increased by $5.9 billion from the year-ago quarter. These amounts were partially offset by a decline in the provision for credit losses of $883 million from a year ago.
The year-over-year decline in revenue was primarily driven by the $12.8 billion increase in representations and warranties provision, which is included in mortgage banking income; an $885 million decrease in mortgage servicing rights results, net of hedges, as a result of higher than expected servicing costs; and a $604 million decrease in core production income. The decrease in core production income was due to a decline in new loan originations caused primarily by lower overall market demand, a drop in market share in both the retail and correspondent sales channels partially driven by pricing actions, as well as the exit from wholesale lending. These declines were offset by a $752 million pretax gain, net of fees, on the sale of Balboa's lender-placed insurance business.
Representations and warranties provision was $14 billion in the second quarter of 2011, compared to $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2010. The company recorded $8.6 billion in provision and other expenses related to the agreement to resolve nearly all of the legacy Countrywide-issued first-lien non-GSE RMBS repurchase exposures and $5.4 billion in provision related to other non-GSE, and to a lesser extent, GSE exposure.
Provision for credit losses decreased $883 million from a year ago to $1.5 billion, reflecting improved portfolio trends, including lower reserve additions related to the Countrywide purchased credit-impaired home equity portfolio.
The increase in noninterest expense from the year-ago quarter was primarily due to a $2.6 billion non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge, $716 million in mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs related to foreclosure delays and other items the company does not expect to recover, litigation expense of $1.9 billion, and default-related and other loss mitigation expenses. These increases were partially offset

by lower production expenses due to lower origination volumes and lower insurance expenses.

reported a net loss of $216 million, compared to net income of $1.1 billion a year ago, due to lower revenue and higher provision for credit losses. The decrease in revenue was largely due to a $1.1 billion reduction in equity investment income as the year-ago period included the gains on the sales of certain strategic investments, lower positive fair value adjustments related to structured liabilities which were down $959 million from the year-ago period, and a $500 million impairment on a strategic investment during this quarter. These were partially offset by increased gains on sales of debt securities of $817 million, a $302 million increase in the dividend from China Construction Bank, and a reduction in merger and restructuring charges of $349 million, compared to the second quarter of 2010.
All Other
Provision for credit losses increased $417 million from a year ago to $1.7 billion comprised of higher reserve additions to the Countrywide purchased credit-impaired discontinued real estate and residential mortgage portfolios due to the impact of further declines in home prices.

Corporate Overview
Second-Quarter 2011 Revenue and Expense
 
 
 
Revenue, net of interest expense, on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis was down 54 percent from the second quarter of 2010 and down 50 percent from the first quarter of 2011, largely due to $14.0 billion of representations and warranties provision recorded in connection with the agreement to resolve nearly all of the legacy Countrywide-issued first-lien non-GSE RMBS repurchase exposures and other mortgage-related costs. Excluding the mortgage-related items and other selected items, revenue, net of interest expense, on an FTE basis was $26.5 billion in the second quarter of 2011.
4
Net interest income on an FTE basis decreased 13 percent from a year earlier. The net interest yield fell 27 basis points from the year-ago quarter, due primarily to lower consumer loan balances and lower yields. Compared to the first quarter of 2011, the net interest yield was down 17 basis points, reflecting lower consumer loan balances and a change in yield mix, as well as lower hedge results and a reduction in trading-related net interest income.
Noninterest income declined $14.3 billion, or 88 percent from the year-ago quarter, due primarily to a $12.8 billion increase in the representations and warranties provision from the year-ago period. This impact on noninterest income was partially offset by a number of items detailed below related to asset sales and other selected items. Together, the representations and warranties provision and these other items negatively impacted noninterest income, on a net basis, by approximately $13.0 billion for the period.

Excluding these items noninterest income

would have been $15 billion in the second quarter of 2011.
The following table details the results on a reported basis and on an adjusted basis excluding certain mortgage-related and other selected items. The adjusted net income of $0.33 per share is at the high end of the prior guidance on June 29, 2011 when the company said net income excluding mortgage items and other selected items would be between $0.28 and $0.33 per share.

Noninterest expense increased $5.6 billion, or 32 percent from the year-ago quarter, driven by the items in the table below. Pre-tax merger and restructuring charges declined $349 million from a year earlier to $159 million. The tax benefit for the second quarter of 2011 was $4.0 billion.
 
 
 
 
Second-Quarter 2011 Credit Quality
 
 
 
 
Note: Ratios do not include loans measured under the fair value option.
Credit quality improved in the second quarter, with net charge-offs declining across all portfolios compared to the second quarter of 2010. Provision for credit losses decreased to less than half from the year-ago level. Additionally, 30+ day performing delinquencies, excluding Federal Housing Administration-insured loans and long-term

Page 17
 
credit protection agreements, declined across most portfolios, and reservable criticized balances also continued to decline, down 30 percent from the year-ago period.
Net charge-offs declined $3.9 billion from the second quarter of 2010, reflecting improvement in both the consumer and commercial portfolios. The decrease was primarily driven by fewer loans becoming delinquent, improved collection rates, and lower bankruptcy filings across the Global Card Services U.S. loan portfolio, as well as fewer and less severe charge-offs across the core commercial portfolio due to the continuing economic recovery's impact on borrower credit profiles.
The provision for credit losses declined to $3.3 billion from $8.1 billion a year ago and included net reserve reductions of $2.4 billion driven primarily by continued expectations of improving delinquency, collection and bankruptcy trends across the Global Card Services portfolios and improvement in economic conditions impacting the core commercial portfolio. These factors were partially offset by additions in the consumer real estate portfolios and life of loan reserve additions of $412 million related to consumer-purchased credit-impaired portfolios obtained in prior periods through acquisitions, reflecting a more negative outlook for home prices.
The allowance for loan and lease losses to annualized net charge-off coverage ratio increased in the second quarter to 1.64 times, compared with 1.63 times in the first quarter of 2011 and 1.18 times in the second quarter of 2010. Excluding purchased credit-impaired loans, the allowance to annualized net charge-off coverage ratio was 1.28, 1.31 and 1.05 times for the same periods, respectively.
Nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were $30.1 billion at June 30, 2011, down from $31.6 billion at March 31, 2011, and $35.6 billion at June 30, 2010.
Capital and Liquidity Management

The company's liquidity position strengthened during the second quarter of 2011. The company's total global excess liquidity increased approximately $16 billion from the end of the first quarter of 2011 to $402 billion at June 30, 2011. The company's time-to-required funding was 22 months at June 30, 2011 and 2010.
During the second quarter of 2011, a cash dividend of $0.01 per common share was paid, and the company declared $301 million in preferred dividends. Period-end common shares issued and outstanding were 10.13 billion for the first and second quarters of 2011 and 10.03 billion for the second quarter of 2010, respectively.

Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures
 
(Dollars in millions)
The Corporation evaluates its business based on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP measure. The Corporation believes managing the business with net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and noninterest income. The Corporation views related ratios and analyses (i.e., efficiency ratios and net interest yield) on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. To derive the fully taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield evaluates the basis points the Corporation earns over the cost of funds.
The Corporation also evaluates its business based on the following ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP measure. Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of common shareholders' equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of average shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible common equity ratio represents common shareholders' equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible equity ratio represents total shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents ending common shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity (i.e., capital). In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders' equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals.
In certain presentations, earnings and diluted earnings per common share, the efficiency ratio, return on average assets, return on common shareholders' equity, return on average tangible common shareholders' equity and return on average tangible shareholders' equity are calculated excluding the impact of goodwill impairment charge of $2.6 billion recorded in the second quarter of 2011. Accordingly, these are non-GAAP measures.
See the tables below and on page 26 for reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures with financial measures defined by GAAP for the three months ended June 30, 2011, March 31, 2011 and June 30, 2010, and for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010.

Commentary
Net income of $2.0B increased $300MM over 1Q11 as credit improvements more than offset lower net interest income from lower average loans and yields Total purchase volume of debit and credit transactions was up seasonally 9% from 1Q11 and increased 6% from 2Q10
New U.S. credit card accounts continue to grow and are up 11% from 1Q11 U.S. credit card net losses improved for the 7th consecutive quarter Payment rate on U.S. credit card improved for the 8th straight quarter Average loans declined $5.6B from 1Q11 due to higher payments, charge-offs and continued non-core portfolio run-off Exited $2.1B receivables at the end of the quarter with minimal income statement impact Upon implementation of the Durbin amendment in 4Q11, revenues are expected to be negatively impacted by approximately $475MM in 4Q11
1 Fully taxable-equivalent basis.
 
Home Price Impacts
The market median shows a decline in home prices of a little more than 3% in 2011 with a 1% increase in 2012, largely in the second-half, which is consistent with our assumptions
From a near-term perspective, direct impacts from changes in HPI would primarily impact a pool of $40B of consumer real estate loans
$13B of nonperforming loans greater than 180 days past due that have been written down to net realizable value
$27B carrying value of PCI loans (currently carried at 66%)
Additionally, for each 1% change in home prices, the liability for representations and warranties on unsettled GSE originations is estimated to be impacted by $125MM based on projected collateral losses and defect rates

Including currently identified RWA mitigation actions, December 31, 2012 RWA is estimated at $1.8T
Additional RWA mitigation efforts have been identified and will continue after December 31, 2012
Also actively mitigating against Basel III capital numerator deductions which phase in starting in 2014
We expect our ratios to be in excess of all required minimums
Assuming no benefit for the Basel III capital deduction phase-in (i.e., fully front-loaded basis), our goal is to achieve a 6.75% - 7% Tier 1 Common Ratio by January 1, 2013

Commentary
2Q11 representations and warranties provision of $14.0B includes
$8.6B non-GSE settlement with BNY Mellon on legacy Countrywide non-GSE private-label securitizations
$5.4B additional reserve for other non-GSE exposure as a result of the private-label settlement and to a lesser extent GSE exposure
Estimated range of possible loss related to non-GSE representations and warranties exposure could be up to $5B over existing accruals at June 30, 2011. This estimate does not include reasonably possible litigation losses. The company is not currently able to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of possible loss with respect to GSE representations and warranties exposure over existing accruals at June 30, 2011.
Outstanding claims decreased $2.0B primarily driven by the Assured settlement early in the quarter
Increase in rescissions in 2Q11 was primarily due to the Assured settlement
Increase in approvals in 2Q11 was due to an increase in throughput in processing GSEs' claims driven by significant claims received from GSEs during the quarter, the increase in approvals did not result in a proportional decrease in claims outstanding
1 Includes $1.7B in demands from private-label securitization investors who do not have the right to demand repurchase of loans directly. However, inclusion of these claims does not mean we believe that the claimant has satisfied the contractual thresholds to direct the securitization trustee to take action or that these claims are otherwise procedurally or substantively valid. A claimant has filed litigation against the company relating to certain of these claims. These claims related to loans underlying securitizations included in the settlement with Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee. If the settlement is approved by the court, these claims will be resolved by the settlement.

Exhibit A: Non-GAAP Reconciliations
Bank of America Corporation and Subsidiaries
Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures
 
(Dollars in millions)
The Corporation evaluates its business based on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP measure. The Corporation believes managing the business with net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and noninterest income. The Corporation views related ratios and analyses (i.e., efficiency ratios and net interest yield) on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. To derive the fully taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield evaluates the basis points the Corporation earns over the cost of funds.
The Corporation also evaluates its business based on the following ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP measure. Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of common shareholders' equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of average shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible common equity ratio represents common shareholders' equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible equity ratio represents total shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents ending common shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity (i.e., capital). In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders' equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals.
In certain presentations, earnings and diluted earnings per common share, the efficiency ratio, return on average assets, return on common shareholders' equity, return on average tangible common shareholders' equity and return on average tangible shareholders' equity are calculated excluding the impact of goodwill impairment charges of $2.6 billion recorded in the second quarter of 2011, and $2.0 billion and $10.4 billion recorded in the fourth and third quarters of 2010. Accordingly, these are non-GAAP measures.
See the tables below and on page 45 for reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures with financial measures defined by GAAP for the three months ended June 30, 2011, March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010, September 30, 2010 and June 30, 2010 and the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010. The Corporation believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation. Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently.

Net income of $1.6B fell seasonally $576MM from 1Q11 on lower sales and trading results partially offset by higher investment banking fees
Sales and trading revenue of $3.8B declined $1.1B from 1Q11 but increased $666MM from 2Q10
 Results include DVA gains of $121MM in 2Q11 compared to losses of $357MM in 1Q11 and gains of $77MM in 2Q10
 As market uncertainty increased towards the end of the quarter due to European debt crisis and global economic concerns, we reduced risk
 Sales and trading RWA declined $37B as we reduced legacy assets, exited proprietary trading and continued to optimize the balance sheet
Investment banking fees excluding self-led were a record high since the Merrill Lynch acquisition
Average loan and lease balances increased $5.8B from 1Q11, primarily from international growth in commercial loans and trade finance in the Corporate Bank

Net loss of $11.9B in 2Q11
Excluding selected large items noted, the net loss was $1.4B and widened $0.6B over 1Q11 driven in part by higher servicing costs as well as higher credit costs

$5.4B additional reserve on other non-GSE, and to a lesser extent GSE
Noninterest expense adjusted for the items noted increased $402MM to $1.9B as staffing levels increased to elevated levels
Provision expense increased $288MM driven by reserve increases in the non-PCI portfolio
Number of first mortgage loans serviced by Legacy Asset Servicing declined by 151K in 2Q11 driven by foreclosure and short sales

Home Equity Portfolio Characteristics
91% of portfolio is stand-alone originations versus piggy back loans $12.3B legacy Countrywide PCI loan portfolio, for which we have a $5.1B allowance at 6/30/11 For the non-PCI portfolio:
 $25.1B are in first-lien position; $93.3B are second-lien positions
 -  Of second-liens, ~43% or $40.4B have CLTV greater than 100%
 Does not mean 100% severity in the event of default
 Assuming proceeds of 85% of the collateral value, we estimate collateral value of $10.5B available for second liens
 Additionally, on 94% of second-liens with CLTVs greater than 100%, the customer is current Allowance on the non-PCI home equity portfolio is $8.0B
1 Charge-offs do not include Countrywide PCI portfolio as those losses were considered in establishing the nonaccretable difference in the original purchase accounting.
