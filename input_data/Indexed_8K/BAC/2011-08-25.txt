On August 25, 2011, Bank of America Corporation (the "Registrant") announced that it had entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement dated August 25, 2011 (the "Securities Purchase Agreement") with Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (the "Investor") pursuant to which the Registrant has agreed to issue and sell to the Investor, and the Investor has agreed to purchase from the Registrant: (1) 50,000 shares of a new series of the Registrant's preferred stock, to be designated as 6% Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series T (the "Preferred Stock"), having a liquidation value of $100,000 per share, and (2) a warrant (the "Warrant") to purchase 700,000,000 shares of the Registrant's common stock (the "Common Stock"), for an aggregate purchase price of $5.0 billion in cash.
Dividends on the Preferred Stock will accrue on the liquidation value at a rate per annum of 6% but will be paid only when, as and if declared by the Registrant's Board of Directors out of legally available funds. At any time when such dividends have not been paid in full, the unpaid amounts will accrue dividends at rate per annum of 8% and the Registrant will not be permitted to pay dividends or other distributions on, or to repurchase, any of the outstanding Common Stock or any of the Registrant's outstanding preferred stock of any series. Following payment in full of any accrued but unpaid dividends, the dividend rate shall remain at 8% per annum. Subject to the approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Preferred Stock may be redeemed by the Registrant at any time at a redemption price of $105,000 per share plus any accrued, unpaid dividends. The Preferred Stock has no maturity date and will rank senior to the outstanding Common Stock (and pari passu with the Registrant's other outstanding series of preferred stock) with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions in liquidation.
As long as at least 10,000 shares of Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, will have the right to approve any future issuance of preferred stock ranking senior to the Preferred Stock, and any amendment of the Registrant's certificate of incorporation or future merger, reclassification or similar event in which the rights and other terms of the Preferred Stock (or successor securities) are substantially modified. Subject to certain limited exceptions, the Preferred Stock and the Warrant are not transferrable for five years, and the shares of Common Stock issuable on exercise of the Warrant may be transferred at any time but only in public offerings and other public market sales, or in private transactions, that do not involve the transfer to any single purchaser or group of more than 3.5% of the outstanding Common Stock.
The Warrant is exercisable at the holder's option at any time or from time to time, in whole or in part, for ten years at an exercise price of $7.142857 per share of the Common Stock. The exercise price and the number of shares issuable on exercise of the Warrant are subject to antidilution adjustments for stock splits, reclassifications, noncash distributions, extraordinary cash dividends, pro rata repurchases of Common Stock, business combination transactions, and certain issuances of Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable for Common Stock) at a price (or having a conversion or exercise price) that is less than 95% of the market price of the Common Stock at the pricing of the securities issuance. The Investor has agreed that it will not increase its beneficial ownership of the outstanding Common Stock above 14.9%. (At the date of issuance, the Warrant will be exercisable for approximately 6.5% of the post-exercise outstanding Common Stock.)
The transaction is expected to close on or about September 1, 2011.
The Securities Purchase Agreement is subject to limited, customary closing conditions primarily consisting of adoption of and filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Designations for the purposes of amending the Registrant's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation establishing the terms of the Preferred
Stock (the "Certificate of Designations").
The Preferred Stock and the Warrant have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and are being issued and sold in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) thereof. The Registrant has agreed to enter into a registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") affording the Investor certain registration rights in respect of the shares of Common Stock for which the Warrant is exercisable.
The foregoing summaries of the Securities Purchase Agreement, the form of the Warrant, the terms of the Preferred Stock, the form of the Certification of Designations and the form of Registration Rights Agreement do not purport to be complete and are subject to and qualified in their entirety by, the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement (and forms of the Certificate of Designations, Warrant and Registration Rights Agreement attached thereto) which are attached hereto as, or included with, Exhibit 1.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
On August 25, 2011, the Registrant issued a press release with respect to the agreement with the Investor. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.

This Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement are or will be valid and binding obligations of the Investor enforceable against the Investor in accordance with their respective terms, except as the same may be limited by Bankruptcy Exceptions.
(ii) The execution, delivery and performance by the Investor of this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and compliance by the Investor with any of the provisions hereof and thereof, will not (i) violate, conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the termination of, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right of termination or acceleration of, or result in the creation of, any lien, security interest,

(iii) Other than such as have been made or obtained, no notice to, filing with, exemption or review by, or authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity is required to be made or obtained by the Investor in connection with the consummation by the Investor of the Purchase except for any such notices, filings, exemptions, reviews, authorizations, consent and approvals the failure of which to make or obtain would not be reasonably likely to have an Investor Material Adverse Effect.
(c) . The Investor is not the Beneficial Owner of (i) any Common Stock or (ii) any securities or other instruments representing the right to acquire Common Stock, other than an aggregate amount of Common Stock with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) not exceeding 2,000,000 shares (without giving effect to the Purchase). The Investor does not have a formal or informal agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person (other than the Company) to acquire, dispose of or vote any securities of the Company. "Beneficial Ownership" shall be determined in accordance with Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act, including the provision that any member of a "group" shall be deemed to have Beneficial Ownership of all securities Beneficially Owned by other members of the group, and except that the exclusion in Rule 13d-3(d)(1)(i) for rights to acquire securities that are not exercisable "within 60 days" shall not apply. "Beneficial Owner" and "Beneficially Own" shall have conforming definitions. Unless specified otherwise, all percentage calculations of Beneficial Ownership will be calculated by including securities that the person (including any group of which such person is a member), but not any other person, has the right to acquire in both the numerator and the denominator.

The Company and the Investor agree that the Company shall provide the Investor with such information as shall be

In the case of any such Transfer of the Warrant, the Company will take such actions with respect to allowing transferees of the Warrant to become parties to, and have rights under, the Registration Rights Agreement as are contemplated by clause (ii) of the first proviso of Section 4.1. Each transaction referenced in clauses (i) and (ii) is herein called a "Transfer".

or Warrant Shares, at any time, to any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Investor where the Investor beneficially owns at least 80% of the equity interests (measured by both voting rights and value) of such subsidiary (each, a ""), but only if the Permitted Transferee agrees in writing for the benefit of the Company to be bound by the terms of this Agreement (including these transfer restrictions); provided that if the Investor ceases to beneficially own at least 80% of the equity interests (measured by both voting rights and value) of such Permitted Transferee, such Permitted Transferee shall be required to transfer such Purchased Securities or Warrant Shares to the Investor or a Permitted Transferee (or in the case of the Warrant Shares, in accordance with Section 4.3(b)) immediately; provided further that no such Transfer shall relieve the Investor of its obligations under this Agreement. The Investor shall cause each Permitted Transferee to comply with this Agreement as applicable to it.
Permitted Transferee
(d) Without the prior written consent of the Company, the Investor and its Permitted Transferees may not engage in any Hedging Transaction with respect to any of the Purchased Securities or Warrant Shares.

Accordingly, the Investor shall not, directly or through others, offer or sell any Purchased Securities or any Warrant Shares except pursuant to a registration statement or pursuant to Rule 144 or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act, if available. Prior to any Transfer of Purchased Securities or Warrant Shares other than pursuant to an effective registration statement, the Investor shall notify the Company of such Transfer and the Company may require the Investor to provide, prior to such Transfer, such evidence that the Transfer will comply with the Securities Act (including written representations and an opinion of counsel) as the Company may reasonably request.

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS INSTRUMENT MAY NOT BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN COMPLIANCE WITH SAID AGREEMENT. ANY SALE OR OTHER TRANSFER NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH SAID AGREEMENT WILL BE VOID."
In the event that (i) any Purchased Securities or Warrant Shares become registered under the Securities Act or (ii) Warrant Shares are eligible to be transferred without restriction in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act, the Company shall (subject to the receipt of any evidence required under Section 4.3(e)) issue new certificates or other instruments representing such Purchased Securities or Warrant Shares, which shall not contain such portion of the above legend that is no longer applicable; provided that the Investor surrenders to the Company the previously issued certificates or other instruments.
 
4.6 . At the request of the Investor, from time to time upon reasonable notice, the Company shall make the Chief Financial Officer of the Company available to meet with the Investor for the purpose of discussing with the Investor the financial condition, business and results of operations of the Company.

Rule 144 Information
13. .

Adjustments and Other Rights
 
(i) . If the Corporation shall (i) declare and pay a dividend or make a distribution on its Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide or reclassify the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, or (iii) combine or reclassify the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant at the time of the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be proportionately adjusted so that the Warrantholder after such date shall be entitled to purchase the number of shares of Common Stock which such holder would have owned or been entitled to receive in respect of the shares of Common Stock subject to this Warrant after such date had this Warrant been exercised immediately prior to such date. In such event, the Exercise Price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be adjusted to the number obtained by dividing (x) the product of (1) the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant before such adjustment and (2) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the record or effective date, as the case may be, for the dividend, distribution, subdivision, combination or reclassification giving rise to this adjustment by (y) the new number of Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant determined pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.

If the Corporation shall issue shares of Common Stock (or rights or warrants or other securities exercisable or convertible into or exchangeable (collectively, a "") for shares of Common Stock) (collectively, "") (other than in Permitted Transactions or a transaction to which subsection (A) of this Section 13 is applicable) without consideration or at a consideration per share (or having a conversion price per share) that is less than 95% of the Market Price on the last trading day preceding the date of the agreement on pricing such shares (or such convertible securities) then, in such event:

(A) the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to the date of the agreement on pricing of such shares (or of such convertible securities) (the "") shall be increased to the number obtained by multiplying the Initial Number by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation outstanding on such date and (y) the number of additional shares of Common Stock issued (or into which convertible securities may be exercised or convert) and (B) the denominator of which shall be the sum of (I) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date and (II) the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration receivable by the Corporation for the total number of shares of Common Stock so issued (or into which convertible securities may be exercised or convert) would purchase at the Market Price on the last trading day preceding the date of the agreement on pricing such shares (or such convertible securities); and
Initial Number
(B) the Exercise Price payable upon exercise of the Warrant shall be adjusted by multiplying such Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the date of the agreement on pricing of such shares (or of such convertible securities) by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant prior to such date and the denominator of which shall
 
be the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant immediately after the adjustment described in clause (A) above.
For purposes of the foregoing, the aggregate consideration receivable by the Corporation in connection with the issuance of such shares of Common Stock or convertible securities shall be deemed to be equal to the sum of the net offering price (after deduction of any related expenses payable to third parties) of all such securities plus the minimum aggregate amount, if any, payable upon exercise or conversion of any such convertible securities into shares of Common Stock; and "" shall include issuances (i) as consideration for or to fund the acquisition of businesses and/or related assets, (ii) in connection with employee benefit plans and compensation related arrangements approved by the Board of Directors, (iii) in connection with conversions or exercises of outstanding securities disclosed in Section 2.2(b) of the Purchase Agreement in accordance with the terms of such securities and (iv) in connection with a broadly marketed offering and sale of Common Stock or convertible securities for cash conducted by the Corporation or its affiliates on a basis consistent with the practice of the Corporation's investment banking affiliates for capital raising transactions by financial institutions. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 13(B) shall become effective immediately upon the date of such issuance
Permitted Transactions
(iii) . In case the Corporation shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all holders of shares of its Common Stock of securities, evidences of indebtedness, assets, cash, rights or warrants (excluding Ordinary Cash Dividends, dividends of its Common Stock and other dividends or distributions referred to in Section 13(A)), in each such case, the Exercise Price in effect prior to such record date shall be reduced immediately thereafter to the price determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the reduction by the quotient of (x) the Market Price of the Common Stock on the last trading day preceding the first date on which the Common Stock trades regular way on the New York Stock Exchange without the right to receive such distribution, minus the amount of cash or the Fair Market Value of the securities, evidences of indebtedness, assets, rights or warrants to be so distributed in respect of one share of Common Stock (the "") divided by (y) such Market Price on such date specified in clause (x); such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed. In such event, the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be increased to the number obtained by dividing (x) the product of (1) the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant before such adjustment, and (2) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the distribution giving rise to this adjustment by (y) the new Exercise Price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. In the case of adjustment for a cash dividend that is, or is coincident with, a regular quarterly dividend, the Per Share Fair Market Value would be reduced by the per share amount of the portion of the cash dividend that would constitute an Ordinary Cash Dividend. In the event that such distribution is not so made, the Exercise Price and the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant then in effect shall be readjusted, effective as of the date when the Board of Directors determines not to distribute such shares, evidences of indebtedness, assets, rights, cash or warrants, as the case may be, to the Exercise Price that would then be in effect and the number of Shares that would then be issuable upon exercise of this Warrant if such record date had not been fixed.
Other Distributions

(iv) .

In such event, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be adjusted to the number obtained by dividing (x) the product of (1) the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant before such adjustment, and (2) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the Pro Rata Repurchase giving rise to this adjustment by (y) the new Exercise Price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.
Certain Repurchases of Common Stock
(v) . In case of any Business Combination or reclassification of Common Stock (other than a reclassification of Common Stock referred to in Section 13(A)), the Warrantholder's right to receive Shares upon exercise of this Warrant shall be converted into the right to exercise this Warrant to acquire the number of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) which the Common Stock issuable (at the time of such Business Combination or reclassification) upon exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to such Business Combination or reclassification would have been entitled to receive upon consummation of such Business Combination or reclassification; and in any such case, if necessary, the provisions set forth herein with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the Warrantholder shall be appropriately adjusted so as to be applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, to the Warrantholder's right to exercise this Warrant in exchange for any shares of stock or other securities or property pursuant to this paragraph. In determining the kind and amount of stock, securities or the property receivable upon exercise of this Warrant following the consummation of such Business Combination, if the holders of Common Stock have the right to elect the kind or amount of consideration receivable upon consummation of such Business Combination, then the Warrantholder shall have the right to make a similar election (including, without limitation, being subject to similar proration constraints) upon exercise of this Warrant with respect to the number of shares of stock or other securities or property which the Warrantholder will receive upon exercise of this Warrant.
Business Combinations
(vi) . All calculations under this Section 13 shall be made to the nearest one-tenth (1/10th) of a cent or to the nearest one-hundredth (1/100th) of a share, as the case may be. Any provision of this Section 13 to the contrary notwithstanding, no adjustment in the Exercise Price or the number of Shares into which this Warrant is exercisable shall be made if the amount of such adjustment would be less than $0.01 or one-tenth (1/10th) of a share of Common Stock, but any such amount shall be carried forward and an adjustment

with respect thereto shall be made at the time of and together with any subsequent adjustment which, together with such amount and any other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate $0.01 or 1/10th of a share of Common Stock, or more.
(vii) . In any case in which the provisions of this Section 13 shall require that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date for an event, the Corporation may defer until the occurrence of such event (i) issuing to the Warrantholder of this Warrant exercised after such record date and before the occurrence of such event the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise by reason of the adjustment required by such event over and above the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise before giving effect to such adjustment and (ii) paying to such Warrantholder any amount of cash in lieu of a fractional share of Common Stock; , , that the Corporation upon request shall deliver to such Warrantholder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such Warrantholder's right to receive such additional shares, and such cash, upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.

Such notice shall also set forth the facts with respect thereto as shall be reasonably necessary to indicate the effect on the Exercise Price and the number, kind or class of shares or other securities or property which shall be deliverable upon exercise of this Warrant. In the case of any action which would require the fixing of a record date, such notice shall be given at least 10 days prior to the date so fixed, and in case of all other action, such notice shall be given at least 15 days prior to the taking of such proposed action. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of any such action.
Notice of Adjustment Event

For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of clauses (vii), (viii), (xi) and (xii) of this Section 7(a) shall apply only in respect of an underwritten offering and only if (based on market prices at the time the offering is requested by the Investor) the number of Registrable Shares to be sold in the offering would reasonably be expected to yield gross proceeds to the Investor of at least the Minimum Amount.
(b) No Registration Statement (including any amendments thereto) shall contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and no Prospectus (including any supplements thereto) shall contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
 
they were made, not misleading, in each case, except for any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact made in reliance on and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the Investor or any underwriter or other distributor specifically for use therein.
(c) At all times after the Company has filed a registration statement with the SEC pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act and until the Termination Date, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to continuously maintain in effect the registration statement of Common Stock under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and to use reasonable best efforts to file all reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder, all to the extent required to enable the Investor to be eligible to sell Registrable Shares (if any) pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act.
(d) The Company may require the Investor and each distributor of Registrable Shares as to which any registration is being effected to furnish to the Company information regarding such Person and the distribution of such securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in connection with such registration.
(e) The Investor agrees by having its Common Stock treated as Registrable Shares hereunder that, upon being advised in writing by the Company of the occurrence of an event pursuant to Section 7(a)(vi), the Investor will immediately discontinue (and direct any other Persons making offers and sales of Registrable Shares to immediately discontinue) offers and sales of Registrable Shares pursuant to any Registration Statement (other than those pursuant to a plan that is in effect prior to such time and that complies with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act) until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed and is furnished with a supplemented or amended Prospectus as contemplated by Section 7(a)(vi), and, if so directed by the Company, the Investor will deliver to the Company all copies, other than permanent file copies then in the Investor's possession, of the Prospectus covering such Registrable Shares current at the time of receipt of such notice.
(f) The Company may prepare and deliver an issuer free-writing prospectus (as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) in lieu of any supplement to a prospectus, and references herein to any "supplement" to a Prospectus shall include any such issuer free-writing prospectus. Neither the Investor nor any other seller of Registrable Shares may use a free-writing prospectus to offer or sell any such shares without the Company's prior written consent.
(g) It is understood and agreed that any failure of the Company to file a registration statement or any amendment or supplement thereto or to cause any such document to become or remain effective or usable within or for any particular period of time as provided in Section 2, 4 or 7 or otherwise in this Agreement, due to reasons that are not reasonably within its control, or due to any refusal of the SEC to permit a registration statement or prospectus to become or remain effective or to be used because of unresolved SEC comments thereon (or on any documents incorporated therein by reference) despite the Company's good faith and reasonable best efforts to resolve those comments, shall not be a breach of this Agreement.
 
(h) It is further understood and agreed that the Company shall not have any obligations under this Section 7 at any time on or after the Termination Date, unless an underwritten offering in which the Investor participates has been priced but not completed prior to the Termination Date, in which event the Company's obligations under this Section 7 shall continue with respect to such offering until it is so completed (but not more than 60 days after the commencement of the offering).
(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to file a Registration Statement or include Registrable Shares in a Registration Statement unless it has received from the Investor, at least five days prior to the anticipated filing date of the Registration Statement, requested information required to be provided by the Investor for inclusion therein.

The Investor shall bear the cost of all underwriting discounts and commissions associated with any sale of Registrable Shares and shall pay all of its own costs and expenses, including all fees and expenses of any counsel (and any other advisers) representing the Investor and any stock transfer taxes.
Registration Expenses
(b) The obligation of the Company to bear the expenses described in Section 8(a) shall apply irrespective of whether a registration, once properly demanded or requested becomes effective or is withdrawn or suspended; , , that Registration Expenses for any Registration Statement withdrawn solely at the request of the Investor (unless withdrawn following commencement of a Suspension Period pursuant to Section 5) shall be borne by the Investor.

Section 9. .
Indemnification
(a) The Company shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Investor and each Person who controls the Investor (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, costs (including reasonable costs of investigation) and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same are made in reliance and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by the Investor expressly for
 
use therein. In connection with an underwritten offering in which the Investor participates conducted pursuant to a registration effected hereunder, the Company shall indemnify each participating underwriter and each Person who controls such underwriter (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Investor.
(b) In connection with any Registration Statement in which the Investor is participating, the Investor shall furnish to the Company in writing such information as the Company reasonably requests for use in connection with any such Registration Statement or Prospectus, or amendment or supplement thereto, and shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company, its officers and directors and each Person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, costs (including reasonable costs of investigation) and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in the Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that the same are made in reliance and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Investor expressly for use therein.
(c) Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying Person of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification and (ii) permit such indemnifying Person to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified Person. Failure so to notify the indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified Person except to the extent that the indemnifying Person is materially and adversely prejudiced thereby. The indemnifying Person shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified Person without its consent (but such consent will not be unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying Person who is entitled to, and elects to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to one local counsel) for all Persons indemnified (hereunder or otherwise) by such indemnifying Person with respect to such claim (and all other claims arising out of the same circumstances), unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified Person there may be one or more legal or equitable defenses available to such indemnified Person which are in addition to or may conflict with those available to another indemnified Person with respect to such claim, in which case such maximum number of counsel for all indemnified Persons shall be two rather than one). If an indemnifying Person is entitled to, and elects to, assume the defense of a claim, the indemnified Person shall continue to be entitled to participate in the defense thereof, with counsel of its own choice, but, except as set forth above, the indemnifying Person shall not be obligated to reimburse the indemnified Person for the costs thereof. The indemnifying Person shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into or agree to any settlement relating to a claim or action for which any indemnified Person would be entitled to indemnification by any indemnified Person hereunder unless such judgment or settlement imposes no ongoing obligations on any such indemnified Person and includes as an unconditional term the giving, by all relevant claimants and plaintiffs to such indemnified Person, a release, satisfactory in form and substance to such
 
indemnified Person, from all liabilities in respect of such claim or action for which such indemnified Person would be entitled to such indemnification. The indemnifying Person shall not be liable hereunder for any amount paid or payable or incurred pursuant to or in connection with any judgment entered or settlement effected with the consent of an indemnified Person unless the indemnifying Person has also consented to such judgment or settlement.
(d) The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified Person or any officer, director or controlling Person of such indemnified Person and shall survive the transfer of securities and the Termination Date but only with respect to offers and sales of Registrable Shares made before the Termination Date or during the period following the Termination Date referred to in Section 7(h).
(e) If the indemnification provided for in or pursuant to this Section 9 is due in accordance with the terms hereof, but is held by a court to be unavailable or unenforceable in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to herein, then each applicable indemnifying Person, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified Person, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying Person on the one hand and of the indemnified Person on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which result in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying Person on the one hand and of the indemnified Person on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying Person or by the indemnified Person, and by such Person's relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. In no event shall the liability of the indemnifying Person be greater in amount than the amount for which such indemnifying Person would have been obligated to pay by way of indemnification if the indemnification provided for under Section 9(a) or 9(b) hereof had been available under the circumstances.
Section 10. .
Securities Act Restrictions
The Registrable Shares are restricted securities under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an available exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Accordingly, the Investor shall not, directly or through others, offer or sell any Registrable Shares except pursuant to a Registration Statement as contemplated herein or pursuant to Rule 144 or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act, if available. Prior to any transfer of Registrable Shares other than pursuant to an effective registration statement, the Investor shall notify the Company of such transfer and the Company may require the Investor to provide, prior to such transfer, such evidence that the transfer will comply with the Securities Act (including written representations or an opinion of counsel) as the Company may reasonably request. The Company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to any Registrable Shares that are to be transferred in contravention of this Agreement. Any certificates representing the Registrable Shares may bear a legend (and the
 
Company's share registry may bear a notation) referencing the restrictions on transfer contained in this Agreement (and the Purchase Agreement), until such time as such securities have ceased to be (or are to be transferred in a manner that results in their ceasing to be) Registrable Shares. Subject to the provisions of this Section 10, the Company will replace any such legended certificates with unlegended certificates promptly upon surrender of the legended certificates to the Company or its designee and cause shares that cease to be Registrable Shares to bear a general unrestricted CUSIP number, in order to facilitate a lawful transfer or at any time after such shares cease to be Registrable Shares.
Section 11. .
Transfers of Rights
(a) If the Investor transfers any rights to a Permitted Transferee in accordance with the Purchase Agreement, such Permitted Transferee shall, together with all other such Permitted Transferees and the Investor, also have the rights of the Investor under this Agreement, but only if the Permitted Transferee signs and delivers to the Company a written acknowledgment (in form and substance satisfactory to the Company) that it has joined with the Investor and the other Permitted Transferees as a party to this Agreement and has assumed the rights and obligations of the Investor hereunder with respect to the rights transferred to it by the Investor. Each such transfer shall be effective when (but only when) the Permitted Transferee has signed and delivered the written acknowledgment to the Company. Upon any such effective transfer, the Permitted Transferee shall automatically have the rights so transferred, and the Investor's obligations under this Agreement, and the rights not so transferred, shall continue, that under no circumstances shall the Company be required to provide (i) more than three Demand Registrations and (ii) more than one Shelf Registration (or two in the event the Investor elects to exchange one of its Demand Rights for a Shelf Registration). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Person who acquires securities transferred in violation of this Agreement or the Purchase Agreement, or who acquires securities that are not or upon acquisition cease to be Registrable Shares, shall have any rights under this Agreement with respect to such securities, and such securities shall not have the benefits afforded hereunder to Registrable Shares.
