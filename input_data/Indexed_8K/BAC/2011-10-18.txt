CHARLOTTE  Bank of America Corporation today reported net income of $6.2 billion, or $0.56 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2011, compared with a net loss of $7.3 billion, or $0.77 per diluted share, in the year-ago period. Revenue, net of interest expense, on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis

rose 6 percent to $28.7 billion.
There were a number of significant items that affected results in both periods. The most recent quarter included, among other things, $4.5 billion (pretax) in positive fair value adjustments on structured liabilities, a pretax gain of $3.6 billion from the sale of shares of China Construction Bank (CCB), $1.7 billion pretax gain in trading Debit Valuation Adjustments (DVA), and a pretax loss of $2.2 billion related to private equity and strategic investments, excluding CCB. The fair value adjustment on structured liabilities reflects the widening of the company's credit spreads and does not impact

regulatory capital ratios. The year-ago quarter included a $10.4 billion goodwill impairment charge. Details on the significant items are included in the revenue and expense section of this press release.
"This quarter's results reflect several actions we took that highlight our ongoing transformation toward becoming a leaner, more focused company," said Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan. "The diversity and depth in our customer and client offerings provided some resiliency in a very challenging environment."
"Our focus this quarter was on strengthening the balance sheet by selling non-core assets and building capital to position the company for future growth," said Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson. "In that regard, we accomplished a great deal. We reduced the size of our balance sheet by $42 billion from the second quarter of 2011, nearly doubled our Tier 1 common equity ratio since early 2009, and continued to have strong liquidity levels even after significantly reducing both short- and long-term debt."
Making progress on operating principles
During the third quarter of 2011, the company made significant progress in line with its operating principles, including the following developments:

Business Highlights
 
 
Financial Overview
Deposits reported net income of $276 million, up $78 million from the year-ago quarter, largely due to lower noninterest expense, partially offset by lower revenue.
Revenue of $3.1 billion was down $27 million from the year-ago quarter driven by lower noninterest income, reflecting the impact of overdraft fee changes that were fully implemented during the third quarter of 2010. Net interest income of $2.0 billion was

relatively flat from the year-ago quarter, while noninterest expense was down $147 million from a year ago to $2.6 billion due to a decrease in operating expenses.

Financial Overview
Card Services reported net income of $1.3 billion, compared to a loss of $9.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. The improvement in net income reflected the impact of a $10.4 billion goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2010 and lower credit costs in

the current period, partially offset by lower revenue. Excluding the impairment charge, net income was up $708 million from the third quarter of 2010.
Revenue declined 16 percent to $4.5 billion from the year-ago quarter, driven by a decrease in net interest income from lower average loans and yields as well as lower noninterest income. Average loans declined $17.5 billion from the year-ago period due to higher payments, charge-offs, continued non-core portfolio runoff and divestitures.
Provision for credit losses decreased $2.0 billion from a year ago to $1.0 billion, reflecting improving delinquencies and collections and fewer bankruptcies as a result of improving economic conditions and lower average loans. Excluding the goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2010, noninterest expense was flat from a year ago.

Business Highlights
 
 
Financial Overview
Global Wealth and Investment Management net income rose 29 percent from the year-ago quarter. Revenue was $4.2 billion, up 9 percent, driven by higher asset management fees, net interest income, and transactional activity.
The provision for credit losses increased $35 million from a year ago, driven by higher costs associated with the residential mortgage portfolio.
Noninterest expense increased 5 percent from a year ago to $3.5 billion, due primarily to higher volume-driven expenses and personnel costs associated with the continued build-out of the business.
Consumer Real Estate Services

Business Highlights
 
 
Financial Overview
Consumer Real Estate Services reported a net loss of $1.1 billion, compared to a net loss of $392 million for the same period in 2010. Revenue declined 22 percent to $2.8 billion. Noninterest expense increased 32 percent to $3.9 billion, and the provision for credit losses fell 29 percent to $918 million.
The year-over-year decline in revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in core production income, lower insurance income due to the sale of Balboa Insurance during the second quarter of 2011, and a decline in net interest income primarily due to the change in composition of assets and liabilities. The decrease in core production income was due to a decline in new loan originations caused primarily by lower overall market demand and a drop in market share in the correspondent lending channels. These declines were partially offset by improved MSR results, net of hedges, and a decline in the representations and warranties provision, which is included in mortgage banking income.
Representations and warranties provision was $278 million in the third quarter of 2011, compared to $872 million in the third quarter of 2010 and $14 billion in the second quarter of 2011.
Provision for credit losses decreased $384 million from a year ago to $918 million, driven primarily by improving portfolio trends, including the Countrywide purchased credit-impaired home equity portfolio.
The increase in noninterest expense from the year-ago quarter was primarily due to higher default-related and other loss mitigation expenses, mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs, which include costs related to foreclosure delays and other out-of-pocket costs that the company does not expect to recover, as well as higher litigation expense. These increases were partially offset by lower insurance expenses and a decline in production expenses due to lower origination volumes.

Global Commercial Banking
 
 
 
Business Highlights
 
 
Financial Overview
Global Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.1 billion, up $406 million from a year ago, due to lower credit costs from improved asset quality. Revenue was $2.5 billion, down 4 percent from the year-ago quarter, due to lower loan balances and lower yields. Noninterest expense was $1.0 billion, down 4 percent from the year-ago quarter despite the increase in FDIC costs, due to higher deposit balances as the business tightly managed costs.
The provision for credit losses decreased $706 million from the year-ago quarter to a benefit of $150 million. The decrease was driven by improved overall economic conditions combined with an accelerated rate of loan resolutions in the commercial real estate portfolio.

Average deposit balances continued to grow, increasing by $25.2 billion from the year-ago quarter, as clients continued to maintain higher levels of liquidity. Average commercial and industrial loan balances have continued to show modest growth, increasing 4 percent from a year ago. However, total average loans and leases decreased $11.3 billion mainly due to reductions in commercial real estate loans.

Financial Overview
Global Banking and Markets reported a net loss of $302 million, down from net income of $1.5 billion in the year-ago quarter. Pretax income was $727 million, down from $2.9 billion a year ago. Revenue declined 26 percent to $5.2 billion, primarily driven by lower sales and trading revenue and investment banking fees. Tax expense for the most recent period included a $774 million charge related to the U.K. tax rate change enacted during the quarter, which reduced the carrying value of the deferred tax assets.
Noninterest expense of $4.5 billion was relatively flat compared to the year-ago period.
Provision for credit losses was $15 million versus a year-ago benefit of $157 million due to higher reserve releases in the prior year period, coupled with loan growth and a slower rate of improvement within the corporate credit portfolio in the current period.
Sales and trading revenue was $2.8 billion, a decrease of 37 percent from the third quarter of 2010. The current period includes DVA gains of $1.7 billion compared to losses of $34 million in the third quarter of 2010, as the company's credit spreads widened throughout the quarter.
Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities sales and trading revenues excluding DVA gains were $314 million, a decrease of $3.2 billion compared to the same quarter last year, due to lower client activity and adverse market conditions. Equities sales and trading revenues excluding DVA gains were $757 million, a decrease of $201 million primarily driven by lower trading revenue in equity derivatives.
Firmwide investment banking fees, including self-led deals, declined to $1.1 billion from $1.4 billion in the third quarter of 2010, mainly due to weakening markets for debt and equity issuances. Total investment banking fees, excluding self-led deals, were down 31 percent from the year-ago period, with 24 percent of investment banking fees originating outside the U.S., compared to 14 percent for the same period last year.
Corporate Bank revenues of $1.4 billion remained strong in a low interest rate environment as average loans and leases increased 25 percent from the same period a year ago to $101.3 billion, driven by growth in both domestic and international commercial loans and international trade finance. Average deposits within the Corporate Bank increased 28 percent to $114.1 billion from the third quarter of 2010 as balances continued to grow from excess liquidity and restrained spending among customers and limited alternative investment options.

reported net income of $4.7 billion, compared to net income of $358 million a year ago, due to higher revenue partially offset by higher provision for credit losses. Revenue increased $5.0 billion due primarily to positive fair value adjustments of $4.5 billion related to structured liabilities as a result of widening of the company's credit spreads, compared to negative fair value adjustments of $190 million in the year-ago period. In addition, the year-ago period included $592 million for a reserve related to payment protection insurance claims in the U.K.
All Other
Additionally, equity investment income was $1.1 billion higher than the year-ago quarter, reflecting the pretax gain on the sale of a portion of the company's CCB investment, partially offset by equity investment losses. The decrease in noninterest expense was due to a reduction in merger and restructuring charges, down $245 million compared to the year-ago period.
Provision for credit losses increased $933 million to $1.4 billion driven primarily by a slower pace of improvement in the residential mortgage portfolio. Additionally, provision expense in the non-U.S. credit card portfolio increased driven by the slowing pace of improvement in projected losses.

Corporate Overview
Third-Quarter 2011 Revenue and Expense
 
 
 
 
Revenue, net of interest expense, on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis rose 6 percent from the third quarter of 2010, reflecting higher noninterest income partially offset by lower net interest income.
Net interest income on an FTE basis decreased 16 percent from a year earlier. The net interest yield fell 40 basis points from the year-ago quarter, driven by hedge ineffectiveness and the acceleration of amortization of premiums on securities due to faster prepayment expectations.
Noninterest income increased $3.7 billion from the year-ago quarter largely due to higher other income and equity investment income, partially offset by lower trading account profits. Other income increased due to the previously mentioned positive fair value adjustments on the structured liabilities and the higher equity investment income from the gain on the sale of CCB shares. This was partially offset by the losses in Global Principal Investments and a write-down of a strategic investment. Trading account profits were lower due to adverse market conditions throughout the quarter.
Noninterest expense decreased $9.6 billion, or 35 percent from the year-ago quarter, to $17.6 billion as the year-ago quarter included a goodwill impairment charge of $10.4 billion. Excluding the goodwill impairment charge, noninterest expense increased by $797 million, reflecting increased personnel costs.
The tax expense for the third quarter of 2011 was $1.2 billion, resulting in a 16.15 percent effective tax rate. The effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2011 included,

Page 15
 
among other items, a larger-than-usual portion of recurring tax preference items (such as tax-exempt income) that was largely offset by the $782 million tax charge related to the U.K. corporate tax rate change as well as tax benefits of approximately $1.1 billion related to capital losses realizable as a result of the CCB sale.
The following is a list of selected items that affected third-quarter 2011 financial results.

Third-Quarter 2011 Credit Quality
 
 
 
 
Credit quality improved in the third quarter, with net charge-offs declining across most portfolios, compared to the third quarter of 2010. Provision for credit losses also decreased significantly from a year ago. Additionally, 30+ performing delinquent loans, excluding Federal Housing Administration-insured loans and long-term standby agreements, declined across all portfolios, and reservable criticized balances also continued to decline, down 35 percent from the year-ago period.
Net charge-offs declined $2.1 billion from the third quarter of 2010, reflecting improvement in most of the consumer and commercial portfolios. The decrease was primarily driven by fewer delinquent loans, improved collection rates, and lower bankruptcy filings across the Card Services loan portfolio, as well as lower losses in the home equity portfolio, driven by fewer delinquent loans.
The provision for credit losses declined to $3.4 billion from $5.4 billion a year ago and included reserve reductions of $1.7 billion driven primarily by improvement in projected delinquencies, collections and bankruptcies across the Card Services portfolios and by

improvement in economic conditions impacting the core commercial portfolio, as evidenced by continued declines in reservable criticized and nonperforming balances.
The allowance for loan and lease losses to annualized net charge-off coverage ratio increased in the third quarter to 1.74 times, compared with 1.64 times in the second quarter of 2011 and 1.53 times in the third quarter of 2010. Excluding purchased credit-impaired loans, the allowance to annualized net charge-off coverage ratio was 1.33, 1.28 and 1.34 times for the same periods, respectively.
Nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were $29.1 billion at September 30, 2011, down from $30.1 billion at June 30, 2011, and $34.6 billion at September 30, 2010.
Capital and Liquidity Management

This compares with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 11.00 percent, a Tier 1 common equity ratio at 8.23 percent, and a Tangible common equity ratio at 5.87 percent at June 30, 2011.
The company's total global excess liquidity increased approximately $40 billion from the end of the third quarter of 2010 to $363 billion at September 30, 2011. The company's time-to-required funding was 27 months at September 30, 2011, compared to 23 months a year ago and 22 months at June 30, 2011.
During the third quarter of 2011, a cash dividend of $0.01 per common share was paid and the company declared $343 million in preferred dividends. Period-end common shares issued and outstanding were 10.13 billion for the second and third quarters of 2011 and 10.03 billion for the third quarter of 2010, respectively.

Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures
 
(Dollars in millions)
The Corporation evaluates its business based on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP measure. The Corporation believes managing the business with net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and noninterest income. The Corporation views related ratios and analyses (i.e., efficiency ratios and net interest yield) on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. To derive the fully taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield evaluates the basis points the Corporation earns over the cost of funds.
The Corporation also evaluates its business based on the following ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP measure. Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of common shareholders' equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of average shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible common equity ratio represents common shareholders' equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible equity ratio represents total shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents ending common shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity (i.e., capital). In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders' equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals.
In certain presentations, earnings and diluted earnings per common share, the efficiency ratio, return on average assets, return on common shareholders' equity, return on average tangible common shareholders' equity and return on average tangible shareholders' equity are calculated excluding the impact of goodwill impairment charge of $2.6 billion recorded in the second quarter of 2011 and $10.4 billion in the third quarter of 2010. Accordingly, these are non-GAAP measures.
See the tables below and on pages 26-27 for reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures with financial measures defined by GAAP for the three months ended September 30, 2011, June 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010. The Corporation believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation. Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently.

Total representations and warranties provision for the quarter was $278MM compared to $14.0B in the prior quarter. The 3Q11 provision related primarily to the GSEs and is based upon results of our ongoing evaluation of the GSEs behavior, which is continually evolving Estimated range of possible loss related to non-GSE representations and warranties exposure could be up to $5B over existing accruals at Sept 30, 2011, unchanged from 2Q11. The company is not currently able to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of possible loss with respect to GSE representations and warranties exposure over existing accruals at Sept 30, 2011 Decrease in rescissions in 3Q11 was primarily due to the Assured settlement in 2Q11 Increase in approvals in 2Q11 was due to an increase in throughput in processing GSEs claims as a result of staffing increases which continued in 3Q11 Our repurchase experience with the GSEs continues to evolve and their repurchase requests and resolution processes has become increasingly inconsistent with our interpretation of our contractual obligations. We will continue to closely evaluate these changing behaviors and intend to repurchase loans to the extent required under the contracts and standards that govern our relationships with the GSEs
1 Includes $1.7B in demands from private-label securitization investors who do not have the right to demand repurchase of loans directly. However, inclusion of these claims does not mean we believe that the claimant has satisfied the contractual thresholds to direct the securitization trustee to take action or that these claims are otherwise procedurally or substantively valid. A claimant has filed litigation against the company relating to certain of these claims. These claims related to loans underlying securitizations included in the settlement with Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee. If the settlement is approved by the court, these claims will be resolved by the settlement.

Exhibit A: Non-GAAP Reconciliations
Bank of America Corporation and Subsidiaries
Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures
 
(Dollars in millions)
The Corporation evaluates its business based on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP measure. The Corporation believes managing the business with net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and noninterest income. The Corporation views related ratios and analyses (i.e., efficiency ratios and net interest yield) on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. To derive the fully taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield evaluates the basis points the Corporation earns over the cost of funds.
The Corporation also evaluates its business based on the following ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP measure. Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of common shareholders' equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of average shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible common equity ratio represents common shareholders' equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible equity ratio represents total shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents ending common shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity (i.e., capital). In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders' equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals.
In certain presentations, earnings and diluted earnings per common share, the efficiency ratio, return on average assets, return on common shareholders' equity, return on average tangible common shareholders' equity and return on average tangible shareholders' equity are calculated excluding the impact of goodwill impairment charges of $2.6 billion recorded in the second quarter of 2011, and $2.0 billion and $10.4 billion recorded in the fourth and third quarters of 2010. Accordingly, these are non-GAAP measures.
See the tables below and on page 45 for reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures with financial measures defined by GAAP for the three months ended September 30, 2011, June 30, 2011, March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and September 30, 2010 and the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010. The Corporation believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation. Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently.

It does not include Federal Reserve Discount Window or FHLB borrowing capacity. Transfers of liquidity from the bank or broker dealer subsidiaries are subject to certain regulatory restrictions.
2 Time to Required Funding is a debt coverage measure and is expressed as the number of months unsecured holding company obligations of both Bank of America Corporation and Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. can be met using only its Global Excess Liquidity Sources without issuing debt or sourcing additional liquidity. For 2Q11 and 3Q11, we have also included in the amount of unsecured contractual obligations the $8.6B liability, including estimated costs, for the previously announced settlement agreement with BNY Mellon.
