, Bank of America Corporation (the "Registrant") entered into separate agreements with certain institutional preferred and trust preferred security holders (the "Exchange Agreements") pursuant to which the Registrant and each such security holder agreed to exchange shares, or depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares, of various series of the Registrant's outstanding preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Preferred Stock"), or trust preferred securities of various trusts formed by or on behalf of the Registrant or its predecessor companies (the "Trust Preferred Securities"), as applicable, for an aggregate of 185,482,705 shares of the Registrant's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock") and an aggregate principal amount of $998.1 million of senior notes of the Registrant (the "Senior Notes").
Pursuant to the Exchange Agreements, the Registrant will receive outstanding shares of Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of $590.4 million and Trust Preferred Securities with an aggregate liquidation preference of $2.1 billion. To the extent the exchanges are not already settled, they are expected to settle on or before November 23, 2011.
The 185,482,705 shares of Common Stock represent approximately 1.83% of the Registrant's outstanding shares of Common Stock as of October 31, 2011. The Senior Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $998.1 million consisted of $273.9 million of 5.625% Notes due October 14, 2016, $660.9 million of 6.000% Notes due September 1, 2017 and $63.3 million of 6.500% Notes due August 1, 2016. The shares of Common Stock and Senior Notes are being issued in reliance upon the exemption set forth in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for securities exchanged by the issuer and an existing security holder where no commission or other remuneration is paid or given directly or indirectly by the issuer for soliciting such exchange.
The Registrant expects that the exchanges described in this Report, in the aggregate, will result in an increase of approximately $1.88 billion in Tier 1 common capital, and increase the Registrant's Tier 1 common capital ratio by approximately 14 basis points under Basel I.
 
The table below lists the title of each applicable series of Preferred Stock or Trust Preferred Securities and the corresponding aggregate liquidation preference or principal amount covered by the Exchange Agreements.
