, November 18, November 21,  November 22, November 23, November 25, November 28, November 29, and December 1, 2011, Bank of America Corporation (the "Registrant") entered into separate agreements with certain institutional preferred and trust preferred security holders (the "Exchange Agreements") pursuant to which the Registrant and each such security holder agreed to exchange shares, or depository shares representing fractional interests in shares, of various series of the Registrant's outstanding preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Preferred Stock"), or trust preferred securities of various trusts formed by or on behalf of the Registrant or its predecessor companies (the "Trust Preferred Securities"), as applicable, for an aggregate of 125,528,595 shares of the Registrant's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock") and an aggregate principal amount of $442.3 million of senior notes of the Registrant (the "Senior Notes").
Pursuant to the Exchange Agreements, the Registrant will receive outstanding shares of Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $314 million and Trust Preferred Securities with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $1.035 billion. To the extent the exchanges are not already settled, they are expected to settle on or before December 8, 2011.
The 125,528,595 shares of Common Stock represent approximately 1.22% of the Registrant's outstanding shares of Common Stock. Accordingly, the Registrant has agreed to issue shares equal to at least 1% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock since the amount reported on the Registrant's last Current Report on Form 8-K filed under this Item 3.02 on November 17, 2011 (the "November 17, 2011 Form 8-K").
The Senior Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $442.2 million consisted of $32.2 million of 5.625% Notes due October 14, 2016, $49 million of 6.000% Notes due September 1, 2017, $232.2 million of 6.500% Notes due August 1, 2016, $48 million of 7.375% Notes due May 15, 2014, and $80.8 million of 7.625% Notes due June 1, 2019.
The shares of Common Stock and Senior Notes reported in this report are being issued in reliance upon the exemption set forth in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for securities exchanged by the issuer and an existing security holder where no commission or other remuneration is paid or given directly or indirectly by the issuer for soliciting such exchange.
The table below lists the title of each applicable series of Preferred Stock or Trust Preferred Securities and the corresponding aggregate liquidation preference or principal amount covered by the Exchange Agreements reported in this report.
 
 
In total, through December 1, 2011 and including those agreements previously reported on the November 17, 2011 Form 8-K, the privately negotiated exchanges have covered the exchange of approximately $4.0 billion aggregate liquidation preference of Preferred Stock and Trust Preferred Securities into 311,011,300 shares of Common Stock and Senior Notes with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.4 billion. In the aggregate, the Registrant expects that the exchanges reported in this report and in the November 17, 2011 Form 8-K, together, will result in an increase of approximately $2.90 billion in Tier 1 common capital, and increase the Registrant's Tier 1 common capital ratio by approximately 21 basis points under Basel I.
