On December 1

, December 2, December 5, December 6, December 7, December 8, December 9, December 12, December 13, December 14 and December 15, 2011, Bank of America Corporation (the "Registrant") entered into separate agreements with certain institutional preferred and trust preferred security holders (the "Exchange Agreements") pursuant to which the Registrant and each such security holder agreed to exchange shares, or depository shares representing fractional interests in shares, of various series of the Registrant's outstanding preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Preferred Stock"), or trust preferred securities or hybrid income securities of various trusts formed by or on behalf of the Registrant or its predecessor companies (the "Trust Preferred Securities"), as applicable, for an aggregate of 88,988,700 shares of the Registrant's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock") and an aggregate principal amount of $885.4 million of senior notes of the Registrant (the "Senior Notes").
Pursuant to the Exchange Agreements, the Registrant will receive outstanding shares of Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $179.1 million and Trust Preferred Securities with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $1.6 billion. To the extent the exchanges are not already settled, they are expected to settle on or before December 22, 2011.
These exchanges represent the completion of the Registrant's announced intention to explore the issuance of up to 400 million shares of common stock and $3 billion of senior notes in exchange for shares of preferred stock and certain trust preferred capital debt securities issued by unconsolidated trust companies, in privately negotiated transactions. In the aggregate, the Registrant expects that the exchanges reported in this report and in the Registrant's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed under this Item 3.02 on December 2, 2011 and November 17, 2011, collectively, will result in an increase of approximately $3.9 billion in Tier 1 common capital, and increase the Registrant's Tier 1 common capital ratio by approximately 29 basis points under Basel I.
 
In the aggregate, the Registrant will receive approximately $5.8 billion in liquidation preference of Preferred Stock and Trust Preferred Securities in the privately negotiated transactions in exchange for 400 million shares of its common stock and approximately $2.3 billion aggregate principal amount of its Senior Notes. The Senior Notes consist of $78.3 million of 7.375% Notes due May 15, 2014, $867.4 million of 6.500% Notes due August 1, 2016, $306.1 million of 5.625% Notes due October 14, 2016, $709.9 million of 6.000% Notes due September 1, 2017 and $364.2 million of 7.625% Notes due June 1, 2019.
The shares of common stock and Senior Notes reported in this report are being issued in reliance upon the exemption set forth in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for securities exchanged by the issuer and an existing security holder where no commission or other remuneration is paid or given directly or indirectly by the issuer for soliciting such exchange.
Going forward the Registrant may, from time to time, engage in similar privately negotiated transactions involving the issuance of common stock, cash or other consideration in exchange for preferred stock and certain trust preferred securities in amounts that are not expected to be material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Registrant.
The table below lists the title of each applicable series of Preferred Stock or Trust Preferred Securities and the corresponding aggregate liquidation preference or principal amount covered by the Exchange Agreements reported in this report as well as the corresponding overall aggregate liquidation preference or principal amount covered by the exchanges reported in this report, the December 2, 2011 Form 8-K and the November 17, 2011 Form 8-K, collectively.
