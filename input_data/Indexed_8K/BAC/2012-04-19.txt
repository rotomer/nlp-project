'
re doing more business and winning in the marketplace,
said Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan.
Our strategy is paying off: With the economy steadily improving and because of the work we have done to strengthen and simplify our company, we saw improved profitability in all of our businesses this quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year.
The narrowing of our credit spreads reflects the significant progress we've made to strengthen the balance sheet," said Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson.
"
During the quarter, we increased our Tier 1 common equity ratio by 92 basis points from the prior quarter, improved our liquidity to record levels and continued to reduce risk-weighted assets. While the improvement in our credit spreads results in a negative adjustment to earnings this quarter, it should not overshadow the positive momentum that we are seeing in our businesses."

Business Segment Results
The company reports results through five business segments: Consumer and Business Banking (CBB), Consumer Real Estate Services (CRES), Global Banking, Global Markets, and Global Wealth and Investment Management (GWIM), with the remaining operations recorded in All Other.
Effective January 1, 2012, the basis of presentation was changed from six segments to five segments. Consumer and Business Banking is made up of the former Deposits and Card Services segments, as well as Business Banking, which was previously part of the Global Commercial Banking segment. The remaining businesses in the Global Commercial Banking segment were combined with the Global Corporate and Investment Banking business, which was included in the former Global Banking and Markets (GBAM) segment to form Global Banking. Global Markets, also part of the former GBAM segment, is now reported as a standalone segment. In addition, certain management accounting methodologies and related allocations were refined. Prior period results have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.

Consumer and Business Banking
Business Highlights
 
Financial Overview
 
Consumer and Business Banking reported net income of
$1.5 billion
, down
$587 million
from the year-ago quarter, due to lower revenue and higher credit costs, partially offset by lower noninterest expense.
 
More
Page
8
Revenue of
$7.4 billion
was down
$1.0 billion
from the year-ago quarter, driven by lower noninterest income of $523 million primarily from the implementation of debit card interchange fee rules as a result of the Durbin Amendment, and a decrease in net interest income of $521 million, primarily from lower average loans and yields. Provision for credit losses, primarily within the Card Services business, increased $216 million from the year-ago quarter to $877 million, reflecting lower reserve reductions in the current period. Noninterest expense was down
$315 million
from the year-ago quarter to
$4.2 billion
primarily due to lower FDIC, marketing and operating expenses.
Consumer Real Estate Services
Business Highlights
 
 
 
More
Page
9
Financial Overview
 
Consumer Real Estate Services reported a net loss of
$1.1 billion
for the
first quarter of 2012
, compared to a net loss of
$2.4 billion
for the same period in 2011. The net loss is driven by continued high costs of managing delinquent and defaulted loans in the servicing portfolio combined with costs associated with managing other legacy mortgage exposures.
 
Revenue
increased
to
$2.7 billion
from
$2.1 billion
in the
first quarter of 2011
. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by higher mortgage banking income, partially offset by lower insurance income due to the sale of Balboa Insurance in mid-2011. Mortgage banking income increased due to lower representations and warranties provision, higher core production income and higher servicing income driven by more favorable MSR results, net of hedges. While CRES loan fundings declined by 76 percent compared to the same period in 2011, largely due to the exit from the correspondent channel, core production revenue increased due to the higher margins on direct originations.
Representations and warranties provision was
$282 million
in the
first quarter of 2012
, compared to
$1.0 billion
in the
first quarter of 2011
, which included the impact of higher estimated repurchase rates related to the GSEs combined with increased experience with a monoline insurer
.
Provision for credit losses in the
first quarter of 2012
decreased
$591 million
from the year-ago quarter to
$507 million
, driven by lower reserve additions related to the Countrywide purchased credit-impaired home equity portfolio and improved portfolio trends.
Noninterest expense
decreased
18 percent
to
$3.9 billion
, primarily due to lower mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs and litigation expense as well as lower direct production expenses due to the exit from correspondent lending at the end of 2011. These declines were partially offset by higher default related servicing expenses.

Global Banking
Business Highlights
 
 
Financial Overview
 
Global Banking
reported net income
of
$1.6 billion
, in line with the year-ago quarter, as lower noninterest expense and lower credit costs from improved asset quality offset the decline in revenue. Revenue was
$4.5 billion
,
down
5 percent
from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to lower investment banking fees and accretion on certain acquired portfolios. Noninterest expense was
$2.2 billion
,
down
6 percent
from the year-ago quarter, primarily from lower personnel expense.
 
The provision for credit losses was a benefit of
$238 million
in the first quarter of 2012, compared with a benefit of $123 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to continued improvement in asset quality in the commercial real estate portfolio.
Firm-wide investment banking fees, including self-led deals, declined to $1.3 billion from $1.6 billion in the year-ago quarter, mainly due to lower advisory and equity underwriting fees.
More
Page
11
Corporate Bank and Commercial Bank revenues of $1.5 billion and $2.1 billion continued to remain strong. Average loans and leases
increased
$20.3 billion
, or 8 percent from the year-ago quarter due to growth in both domestic and international corporate loans and international trade finance. Average deposits increased
$11.7 billion
, or 5 percent, from the first quarter of 2011 as balances continued to grow from excess market liquidity and limited alternative investment options. Treasury Services revenue remained strong in the first quarter of 2012 at $1.6 billion, up 3 percent from the fourth quarter of 2011 and 8 percent higher than the prior-year quarter.
Global Markets
n/m = not meaningful
  
Business Highlights
  
Financial Overview
Global Markets revenue more than doubled from the fourth quarter of 2011 to $4.2 billion, but was down 20 percent from the prior-year quarter due to significantly higher DVA losses in the first quarter of 2012. Excluding DVA, revenue was $5.6 billion in the first quarter of 2012, compared with $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $5.6 billion in the first quarter of 2011.
Net income was $798 million in the first quarter of 2012, including $1.4 billion in DVA losses. This compares with net income of $1.4 billion in the year-ago quarter, which included DVA losses of $357 million. Noninterest expense of $3.1 billion was relatively flat compared to the year-ago quarter.
More
Page
12
Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities sales and trading revenue, excluding DVA losses, was $4.1 billion, an increase of $432 million compared to the prior year. The increase reflected improving global markets sentiment as the European debt crisis stabilized coupled with favorable news regarding the U.S. economic environment. Equities sales and trading revenue, excluding DVA losses, was $1.1 billion, a decline of $233 million from the year-ago quarter. Although market share increased in the U.S. and EMEA, the revenue decrease was driven by overall lower market volumes and commissions.
Global Wealth and Investment Management
Business Highlights
 
More
Page
13
Financial Overview
 
Global Wealth and Investment Management net income was comparable to the year-ago quarter while revenue was down 3 percent to
$4.4 billion
largely as a result of lower transactional activity compared to the year-ago quarter.
Noninterest expense
decreased
4 percent
from the year-ago quarter to
$3.5 billion
, due to lower FDIC expense and other volume-driven expenses, lower litigation costs, and other reductions related to expense discipline, partially offset by expenses related to the build-out of the business. The provision for credit losses remained flat at
$46 million
from the year-ago quarter.
Assets Under Management rose $28.0 billion to $693.0 billion from the year-ago quarter driven by long-term AUM flows, while average loan balances were up $2.2 billion from the year-ago quarter to $103.0 billion.
All Other
 
1
All Other reported a net loss of
$2.6 billion
in the
first quarter of 2012
, compared to a net loss of
$1.1 billion
for the same period a year ago, primarily due to an increase in negative fair value adjustments on structured liabilities to
$3.3 billion
in the current period compared to
$586 million
in the year-ago quarter, partially offset by $1.2 billion of gains resulting from the repurchase of certain debt and trust-preferred securities for cash and common shares. Equity investment income decreased to $417 million in the first quarter of 2012 from $1.4 billion in the year-ago quarter, as the year-ago quarter included a gain on an equity investment.
Provision for credit losses
decreased
$919 million
to
$1.2 billion
, driven primarily by lower reserve additions to the Countrywide purchased credit-impaired discontinued real estate and residential mortgage portfolios, as well as improvement in delinquencies and bankruptcies in the non U.S. credit card portfolio.

Corporate Overview
Revenue and Expense
Revenue, net of interest expense, on an FTE basis
fell
17 percent
from the
first quarter of 2011
, driven by $4.8 billion in negative valuation adjustments and lower net interest income compared to the year-ago quarter. Excluding the valuation adjustments in both periods, revenue was $27.3 billion in the first quarter of 2012, compared to $28.0 billion in the first quarter of 2011
2
.
Net interest income on an FTE basis decreased 11 percent from the year-ago quarter. The net interest yield fell 16 basis points from the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by lower consumer loan balances and yields. This was partially offset by a reduction in long-term debt balances.
Noninterest income
decreased
$3.3 billion
from the year-ago quarter, driven by $3.3 billion in negative valuation adjustments on structured liabilities and $1.5 billion in DVA losses. Additionally, equity investment income declined as the year-ago quarter included gains on the sale of certain equity investments and insurance income declined primarily due to the sale of Balboa Insurance in mid-2011 combined with the additional provision related to payment protection insurance claims in the U.K. in the current quarter. Mortgage banking income increased due to lower representations and warranties provision compared to the year-ago quarter.
Noninterest expense
decreased
$1.1 billion
, or
6 percent
from the year-ago quarter, to
$19.1 billion
primarily due to lower litigation expense and a reduction in mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs.
Income tax expense for the
first quarter of 2012
was
$66 million
, resulting in a 9.2 percent effective tax rate. The effective tax rate during the quarter was driven by $128 million of discrete tax benefits and by the impact of recurring tax preference items.

Credit Quality
Note: Ratios do not include loans measured under the fair value option.
  
Credit quality continued to improve in the first quarter of 2012, with net charge-offs declining across most major portfolios, compared to the
first quarter of 2011
. Provision for credit losses decreased significantly from a year ago. Additionally, 30+ day performing delinquent loans, excluding Federal Housing Administration-insured loans and long-term standby agreements, declined across all major portfolios, and reservable criticized balances also continued to decline, down 38 percent from the year-ago period.
Net charge-offs were flat at
$4.1 billion
in the
first quarter of 2012
from the
fourth quarter of 2011
and down from
$6.0 billion
in the
first quarter of 2011
. The decrease from the year-ago quarter reflected improvement in most major consumer and commercial portfolios. Compared to the prior quarter, improvement in the core commercial portfolios and U.S. credit card loan portfolio was offset by higher recoveries from the sale of previously charged-off U.K. credit card loans occurring in the prior quarter. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by fewer delinquent loans, improved collection rates and lower bankruptcy filings across the Card Services portfolio within CBB, as well as lower net charge-offs in both the home equity portfolio, driven by fewer delinquent loans, and core commercial portfolios.
  
The provision for credit losses declined to
$2.4 billion
in the
first quarter of 2012
from
$2.9 billion
in the
fourth quarter of 2011
and
$3.8 billion
in the
first quarter of 2011
. The provision for credit losses for the first quarter of 2012 was $1.6 billion lower than net charge-offs, resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit loss. This was driven primarily by improvement in bankruptcies and delinquencies across the Card Services portfolio within CBB, reductions in the home equity portfolio and improvement in economic conditions impacting the core commercial portfolio, as evidenced by continued declines in reservable criticized and commercial nonperforming balances.

The allowance for loan and lease losses to annualized net charge-off coverage ratio decreased in the
first quarter of 2012
to
1.97
times, compared with
2.10
times in the
fourth quarter of 2011
related to the recoveries occurring in the prior quarter noted above, but increased from
1.63
times in the
first quarter of 2011
. Excluding purchased credit-impaired loans, the allowance to annualized net charge-off coverage ratio was
1.43
times,
1.57
times and
1.31
times for the same periods, respectively.
Nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were
$27.8 billion
at
March 31, 2012
, an increase from
$27.7 billion
at
December 31, 2011
but down from $31.6 billion at March 31, 2011. The increase in the first quarter of 2012 was driven by the reclassification of $1.9 billion in performing junior-lien home equity loans, that had an underlying first-lien loan 90 days or more past due, to nonperforming status, due to interagency supervisory guidance issued by the joint bank regulatory agencies in the first quarter of 2012. This change did not have any impact on the company's allowance or provision expense as the company previously considered the additional risk these loans pose in its reserving process.
Capital and Liquidity Management
The Tier 1 common equity ratio increased significantly during the first quarter to
10.78 percent
from
9.86 percent
at
December 31, 2011
and
8.64 percent
at
March 31, 2011
. The Tier 1 capital ratio was
13.37 percent
at March 31, 2012. This compares with
12.40 percent
at
December 31, 2011
and
11.32 percent
at
March 31, 2011
.
The company's total Global Excess Liquidity Sources increased $28 billion from the end of the fourth quarter of 2011 and $20 billion from the end of the
first quarter of 2011
to a record high of $406 billion at
March 31, 2012
. Time-to-required funding increased to 31 months at
March 31, 2012
from 29 months at
December 31, 2011
and 25 months at
March 31, 2011
.
During the
first quarter of 2012
, a cash dividend of
$0.01
per common share was paid and the company recorded
$325 million
in preferred dividends net of a $44 million benefit on preferred stock exchanges. Period-end common shares issued and outstanding were 10.78 billion and 10.13 billion for the
first quarter of 2012
and
2011
, respectively.

The Corporation evaluates its business based on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP financial measure. The Corporation believes managing the business with net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and noninterest income. The Corporation views related ratios and analyses (i.e., efficiency ratios and net interest yield) on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. To derive the fully taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield evaluates the basis points the Corporation earns over the cost of funds.
The Corporation also evaluates its business based on the following ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on average tangible common shareholders equity measures the Corporations earnings contribution as a percentage of average common shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders equity measures the Corporations earnings contribution as a percentage of average shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible common equity ratio represents ending common shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible equity ratio represents total ending shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents ending common shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporations use of equity (i.e., capital). In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals.
In addition, the Corporation evaluates its business segment results based on return on average economic capital, a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on average economic capital for the segments is calculated as net income adjusted for cost of funds and earnings credits and certain expenses related to intangibles, divided by average economic capital. Economic capital represents average allocated equity less goodwill and a percentage of intangible assets. It also believes the use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides additional clarity in assessing the segments.
In certain presentations, earnings and diluted earnings per common share, the efficiency ratio, return on average assets, return on common shareholders equity, return on average tangible common shareholders equity and return on average tangible shareholders equity are calculated excluding the impact of a goodwill impairment charge of
$581 million
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011. Accordingly, these are non-GAAP financial measures.

Tier 1 Common Equity Ratio Improved 92bps in 1Q12  Tier 1 common equity ratio increased 92bps from 4Q11 to 10.78% driven by capital actions in the quarter, continued reduction of risk-weighted assets and net income earned  In 1Q12 employees were paid a portion of 2011 incentive compensation in stock, increasing the Tier 1 common equity ratio 7bps  Liability management through debt and trust preferred repurchases generated 13bps improvement in the Tier 1 common equity ratio  Risk-weighted assets declined $64B during the quarter improving the Tier 1 common equity ratio 52bps  Improvement was driven by lower loan and commitment levels and optimization of off-balance sheet over-the-counter assets  The $3.3B pre-tax negative FVO valuation adjustment does not impact regulatory capital  Basel III fully phased-in Tier 1 common equity ratio expected to be above 7.50% by YE12 2 Basel I Tier 1 Common Ratio Roll-forward 8.23% 8.65% 9.86% 0.07% 0.13% 0.52% 0.20% 10.78% 2Q11 3Q11 4Q11 Employee Share Issuance Liability Management RWA Reduction Earnings 1Q12 1 ____________________ 1 Excludes impact of debt and trust preferred repurchases. 2 We expect Basel III Tier 1 common ratio estimates to evolve over time along with the Basel III rules. Changes in businesses and economic conditions will impact these estimates. In addition to Basel I requirements and capital ratios, these estimates assist management, investors and analysts in assessing capital adequacy and comparability under the proposed Basel III capital standards to other financial services companies. We will continue to evaluate the potential impact of the proposed rules and anticipate we will be in compliance with any final rules by the projected implementation date. Estimate also assumes approval of all regulatory models.
 
Legacy Assets & Servicing (within CRES) 1 ____________________ 1 Effective January 1, 2012, servicing activities previously recorded in Home Loans were moved to Legacy Assets & Servicing, and results of MSR activities, including net hedge results, and goodwill were moved from Other to Legacy Assets & Servicing. 2 Excludes litigation expense of $313MM, $1.5B and $785MM in 1Q12, 4Q11 and 1Q11, respectively. 3 Third-party staffing includes offshore employees and contractors.  60+ days delinquent loans serviced declined 6% or 67K to 1,089K  Legacy Assets & Servicing noninterest expense of $2.7B, excluding litigation expense, increased from 4Q11 due to higher mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs  Staffing levels increased by 2,500 from 4Q11 as a result of staffing for single point of contact programs to enhance customer experience  In addition, third-party staffing 3 increased by nearly 4,000 to a total of more than 16,000 4Q11 1Q11 First-lien servicing (# of loans in thousands) 8,856 (315) (1,559) 60+ days delinquent first mortgages in servicing portfolio (# of loans in thousands) 1,089 (67) (226) Noninterest expense ($B) $3.0 ($0.8) ($0.3) Noninterest expense, excluding litigation ($B) 2 $2.7 $0.4 $0.2 Full-time equivalent employees (in thousands) 38.1 2.5 10.1 Inc / (Dec) 1Q12 Legacy Assets & Servicing Highlights

The company is not currently able to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of possible loss with respect to GSE representations and warranties exposure over existing accruals at March 31, 2012  Increase in private-label new claims is primarily related to repurchase requests received from trustees on private-label securitization transactions not included in the BNY Mellon settlement  The GSEs repurchase requests, standards for rescission of repurchase requests and resolution processes continue to be inconsistent with the GSEs own past conduct and our interpretation of our contractual obligations. These developments have resulted in an increase in claims outstanding from the GSEs. We intend to repurchase loans to the extent required under the contracts and standards that govern our relationships with the GSEs  In addition to the claims in these tables, we have received repurchase demands from private-label securitization investors and a master servicer where we believe the claimant has not satisfied the contractual thresholds to direct the securitization trustee to take action and/or that these demands are otherwise procedurally or substantively invalid. The amounts outstanding of total demands were $3.1B as of March 31, 2012 and $1.7B as of December 31, 2011, September 30, 2011, June 30, 2011 and March 31, 2011. $1.7B of these demands relate to loans underlying securitizations included in the settlement with BNY Mellon, as trustee. A claimant has filed litigation against us relating to $1.4B of such demands. If the BNY Mellon settlement is approved by the court, demands related to loans underlying securitizations included in the settlement with BNY Mellon, as trustee will be resolved by the settlement Liability for Representations and Warranties ($MM) Outstanding Claims by Counterparty ($MM) New Claim Trends ($MM) Representations and Warranties 1Q1 2Q11 3Q11 4Q11 1Q12 Beginning Balance $5,438 $6,220 $17,780 $16,271 $15,858 Additions for new sales 7 3 3 7 5 Provision 1,013 14,037 278 26 282 Charge-offs (238) (2,480) (1,790) (68 ) (399) Ending Balance $6,220 $17,780 $16,271 $15,858 $15,746 1Q11 2Q11 3Q11 4Q11 1Q12 Mix 1 Pre 2005 $132 $214 $95 $77 $86 3% 2005 412 441 668 751 516 14% 2006 1,609 780 925 1,400 2,302 31% 2007 2,277 1,784 1,493 2,168 1,382 40% 2008 488 398 451 331 264 8% Post 2008 144 162 164 126 193 4% New Claims $5,062 $3,779 $3,796 $4,853 $4,743 % GSEs 86% 89% 86% 68% 63% Rescinded claims $950 $3,822 $1,499 $1,229 $773 Approved repurchas 1,134 2,028 2,255 1,170 480 Outstanding claims 11,896 9,915 10,008 12,607 16,094 % GSEs 45% 51% 47% 50% 50% ____________________ 1 Mix for new claims trend is calculated based on last four quarters.

The Corporation evaluates its business based on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP financial measure. The Corporation believes managing the business with net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and noninterest income. The Corporation views related ratios and analyses (i.e., efficiency ratios and net interest yield) on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. To derive the fully taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield evaluates the basis points the Corporation earns over the cost of funds.
The Corporation also evaluates its business based on the following ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on average tangible common shareholders equity measures the Corporations earnings contribution as a percentage of average common shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders equity measures the Corporations earnings contribution as a percentage of average shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible common equity ratio represents ending common shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible equity ratio represents total ending shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents ending common shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporations use of equity (i.e., capital). In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals.
In addition, the Corporation evaluates its business segment results based on return on average economic capital, a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on average economic capital for the segments is calculated as net income adjusted for cost of funds and earnings credits and certain expenses related to intangibles, divided by average economic capital. Economic capital represents average allocated equity less goodwill and a percentage of intangible assets. It also believes the use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides additional clarity in assessing the segments.
In certain presentations, earnings and diluted earnings per common share, the efficiency ratio, return on average assets, return on common shareholders equity, return on average tangible common shareholders equity and return on average tangible shareholders equity are calculated excluding the impact of goodwill impairment charges of
$581 million
and
$2.6 billion
recorded in the fourth and second quarters of 2011. Accordingly, these are non-GAAP financial measures.

Bank of America 1Q12 Financial Results April 19, 2012
 
Bank of America and its management may make certain statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as anticipates, targets, expects, hopes, estimates, intends, plans, goals, believes, continue and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will, should, would and could. The forward-looking statements made in this presentation represent Bank of America's current expectations, plans or forecasts of its future results and revenues and include statements about: the companys ongoing momentum on several fronts; we continue to find ways to accelerate mitigating actions ahead of Basel III implementation; our belief that we will be substantially above any minimum requirements under Basel III with lower debt levels and high liquidity levels; Basel III fully phased in Tier 1 common equity ratio expected to be above 7.50% by YE12; the company being well prepared for $34B of parent company unsecured debt maturities in 2Q12; that the company expects liquidity levels to come down somewhat in the second quarter, primarily due to $34B of parent company debt that will mature during the quarter, including $24B of TLGP maturities; that we anticipate that even though the absolute level of liquidity will be lower, the Time to Required Funding will remain close to its current level and significantly above our target minimum of 21 months; we expect that our benchmark issuance for the remainder of 2012 will be less than $5B; expected long-term debt reductions, including long-term debt declines of $50-$100 billion by YE2013; the $800 million charge in the 3Q12 from the anticipated U.K. tax rate reduction; the expected tax rate of approximately 27 percent for the remainder of 2012, except for unusual items; we continue to expect zero issuance of parent company and broker/dealer short-term unsecured funding; we believe the company is near the peak in staffing levels for Legacy Assets & Servicing and making progress, including cost reductions over the remaining quarters in 2012; expected cost savings in non-Legacy Assets & Servicing areas of the company; expected completion in May of, and increased savings later in 2012 from, Phase II of Project New BAC; we believe we can realize substantial cost savings in the second half of this year from lower head count, Project New BAC Phase 1 and Phase 2 results and an improving delinquent mortgage loan servicing pool; expected improvement, although at a slower rate, in residential mortgage and home equity 30+ days performing delinquencies; Bank of America will continue in 2012 to focus on capital levels, cost base, core business and customer growth, managing residual legacy risks down, including reducing negative impact on earnings; expected continued improvement in credit risk as legacy portfolios continue to run off; favorable returns on capital; continued management of mortgage issues; and other similar matters. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond Bank of America's control. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should consider all of the following uncertainties and risks, as well as those more fully discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors of Bank of America's 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any of Bank of America's subsequent SEC filings; the accuracy and variability of estimates and assumptions in determining the expected value of the loss-sharing reinsurance arrangement relating to the agreement with Assured Guaranty Ltd. and the total cost of the agreement to the company; our resolution of certain representations and warranties obligations with the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) and our ability to resolve the GSEs remaining claims; our ability to resolve our representations and warranties obligations, and any related servicing, securities, fraud, indemnity or other claims with monolines, and private-label investors and other investors, including those monolines and investors from whom we have not yet received claims or with whom we have not yet reached any resolutions; our mortgage modification policies and related results; the timing and amount of any potential dividend increase, including any necessary approvals; adverse changes to the companys credit ratings from the major credit ratings agencies; estimates of the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities; the identification and effectiveness of any initiatives to mitigate the negative impact of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; our ability to limit liabilities acquired as a result of the Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. and Countrywide Financial Corporation acquisitions; and decisions to downsize, sell or close units or otherwise change the business mix of the company. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and Bank of America undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statement was made. 2 Forward-Looking Statements
 
 This information is preliminary and based on company data available at the time of the presentation  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation  Certain financial measures contained herein represent non-GAAP financial measures. For more information about the non-GAAP financial measures contained herein, please see the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and accompanying reconciliations in the earnings press release and other earnings-related information available through the Bank of America Investor Relations web site at: http://investor.bankofamerica.com 3 Important Presentation Format Information
 
Key Takeaways for 1Q12 Results  Reported earnings of $653MM or $0.03 per diluted share  Results include negative valuation adjustments of $4.8B pre-tax, or $0.28 per share, resulting from the narrowing of the company's credit spreads  Capital and liquidity continued to increase and are at record levels  Capital markets activity improved driving sales and trading results significantly above 4Q11 and in line with 1Q11 results, excluding DVA valuations  All business segments reflect improved profitability from 4Q11  Lowest provision expense quarter since 3Q07 as credit quality continues to improve  Expenses declined from 4Q11 despite higher revenue-related incentive and annual retirement-eligible compensation costs  The low level of interest rates continues to be a headwind  Capitalized on opportunity to realize $1.2B of gains on debt and trust preferred repurchases 4

Represents a non-GAAP financial measure. 2 On a GAAP basis, total revenue, net of interest expense, and income tax expense were $22.3B and $66MM for 1Q12. For reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see the accompanying reconciliations in the earnings press release and other earnings-related information. 3 All items are pre-tax. Total revenue, net of interest expense 1, 2 $22.5 Noninterest expense 19.2 Pre-tax pre-provision 1 3.3 Provision for credit losses 2.4 Income before income taxes 0.9 Income tax expense 1, 2 0.2 Net income $0.7 Diluted earnings per share $0.03 Gains on debt and trust preferred repurchases $1.2 Equity investment income 0.8 Gains on sales of debt securities 0.8 Fair valu adjustment on structured liabilities ($3.3) DVA on trading liabilities (1.5) Annual reti ement-eligible compensation costs (0.9) Litigation expense (0.8)
 
Tier 1 Common Equity Ratio Improved 92bps in 1Q12  Tier 1 common equity ratio increased 92bps from 4Q11 to 10.78% driven by capital actions in the quarter, continued reduction of risk-weighted assets and net income earned  In 1Q12 employees were paid a portion of 2011 incentive compensation in stock, increasing the Tier 1 common equity ratio 7bps  Liability management through debt and trust preferred repurchases generated 13bps improvement in the Tier 1 common equity ratio  Risk-weighted assets declined $64B during the quarter improving the Tier 1 common equity ratio 52bps  Improvement was driven by lower loan and commitment levels and optimization of off-balance sheet over-the-counter assets  The $3.3B pre-tax negative FVO valuation adjustment does not impact regulatory capital  Basel III fully phased-in Tier 1 common equity ratio expected to be above 7.50% by YE12 2 Basel I Tier 1 Common Ratio Roll-forward 6 8.23% 8.65% 9.86% 0.07% 0.13% 0.52% 0.20% 10.78% 2Q11 3Q11 4Q11 Employee Share Issuance Liability Management RWA Reduction Earnings 1Q12 1 ____________________ 1 Excludes impact of debt and trust preferred repurchases. 2 We expect Basel III Tier 1 common ratio estimates to evolve over time along with the Basel III rules. Changes in businesses and economic conditions will impact these estimates. In addition to Basel I requirements and capital ratios, these estimates assist management, investors and analysts in assessing capital adequacy and comparability under the proposed Basel III capital standards to other financial services companies. We will continue to evaluate the potential impact of the proposed rules and anticipate we will be in compliance with any final rules by the projected implementation date. Estimate also assumes approval of all regulatory models.
 
Funding and Liquidity  Global Excess Liquidity Sources grew $28B vs. 4Q11 to a record $406B  Parent company liquidity strong at $129B, up $4B while parent company LTD was reduced $5B  Time to required funding increased to 31 months  Well prepared to address $34B of parent company maturities in 2Q12 including the remaining $24B related to the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program 3  Parent company and broker/dealer short-term unsecured funding was essentially zero in 1Q12  Total long-term debt declined $17B to $355B in 1Q12 7 Global Excess Liquidity Sources ($B) and Time to Required Funding (months) 1, 2 1 Global Excess Liquidity Sources include cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities, limited to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS, and a select group of non- U.S. government and supranational securities, and are readily available to meet funding requirements as they arise. It does not include Federal Reserve Discount Window or Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing capacity. Transfers of liquidity from the bank or broker/dealer subsidiaries are subject to certain regulatory restrictions. 2 Time to required funding is a debt coverage measure and is expressed as the number of months unsecured holding company obligations of both Bank of America Corporation and Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. can be met using only its Global Excess Liquidity Sources without issuing debt or sourcing additional liquidity. For 2Q11 through 1Q12, we have included in the amount of unsecured contractual obligations the $8.6B liability, including estimated costs, for the previously announced BNY Mellon settlement.

The company is not currently able to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of possible loss with respect to GSE representations and warranties exposure over existing accruals at March 31, 2012  Increase in private-label new claims is primarily related to repurchase requests received from trustees on private-label securitization transactions not included in the BNY Mellon settlement  The GSEs repurchase requests, standards for rescission of repurchase requests and resolution processes continue to be inconsistent with the GSEs own past conduct and our interpretation of our contractual obligations. These developments have resulted in an increase in claims outstanding from the GSEs. We intend to repurchase loans to the extent required under the contracts and standards that govern our relationships with the GSEs  In addition to the claims in these tables, we have received repurchase demands from private-label securitization investors and a master servicer where we believe the claimant has not satisfied the contractual thresholds to direct the securitization trustee to take action and/or that these demands are otherwise procedurally or substantively invalid. The amounts outstanding of total demands were $3.1B as of March 31, 2012 and $1.7B as of December 31, 2011, September 30, 2011, June 30, 2011 and March 31, 2011. $1.7B of these demands relate to loans underlying securitizations included in the settlement with BNY Mellon, as trustee. A claimant has filed litigation against us relating to $1.4B of such demands. If the BNY Mellon settlement is approved by the court, demands related to loans underlying securitizations included in the settlement with BNY Mellon, as trustee will be resolved by the settlement 30 Liability for Representations and Warranties ($MM) Outstanding Claims by Counterparty ($MM) New Claim Trends ($MM) Representations and Warranties 1Q1 2Q11 3Q11 4Q11 1Q12 Beginning Balance $5,438 $6,220 $17,780 $16,271 $15,858 Additions for new sales 7 3 3 7 5 Provision 1,013 14,037 278 26 282 Charge-offs (238) (2,480) (1,790) (68 ) (399) Ending Balance $6,220 $17,780 $16,271 $15,858 $15,746 1Q11 2Q11 3Q11 4Q11 1Q12 Mix 1 Pre 2005 $132 $214 $95 $77 $86 3% 2005 412 441 668 751 516 14% 2006 1,609 780 925 1,400 2,302 31% 2007 2,277 1,784 1,493 2,168 1,382 40% 2008 488 398 451 331 264 8% Post 2008 144 162 164 126 193 4% New Claims $5,062 $3,779 $3,796 $4,853 $4,743 % GSEs 86% 89% 86% 68% 63% Rescinded claims $950 $3,822 $1,499 $1,229 $773 Approved repurchas 1,134 2,028 2,255 1,170 480 Outstanding claims 11,896 9,915 10,008 12,607 16,094 % GSEs 45% 51% 47% 50% 50% ____________________ 1 Mix for new claims trend is calculated based on last four quarters.
