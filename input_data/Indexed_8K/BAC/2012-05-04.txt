ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS.
From time to time, including in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 (the Annual Report), Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Corporation) have indicated that the Corporation may reclassify its business segment results based on, among other things, changes in its organizational alignment. In the Annual Report, the Corporation reported its results of operations through six business segments:
Deposits
,
Card Services
,
Consumer Real Estate Services (CRES), Global Commercial Banking
,
Global Banking & Markets (GBAM)
and
Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM
), with the remaining operations recorded in
All Other
. Effective January 1, 2012, consistent with the presentation used in the Corporation's Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2012, the Corporation changed its basis of presentation from six to five segments:
Consumer & Business Banking (CBB)
,
CRES
,
Global Banking
,
Global Markets
and
GWIM
, with the remaining operations recorded in
All Other
. The former
Deposits
and
Card Services
segments, as well as Business Banking, which was included in the former
Global Commercial Banking
segment, are now reflected in
CBB
. The former
Global Commercial Banking
segment was combined with the Global Corporate and Investment Banking business, which was included in the former
Global Banking & Markets (GBAM)
segment, to form
Global Banking
. The remaining global markets business of
GBAM
is now reported as a separate
Global Markets
segment. In addition, certain management accounting methodologies and related allocations were refined. Prior period results have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
This Current Report on Form 8-K and the exhibits hereto update the business segment information presented in the Annual Report only to the extent this information is impacted by the revised business segment reporting methodology. Portions of the following items from the Annual Report have been updated to reflect the revised business segment methodology:
All updates to the Annual Report relate solely to the presentation of segment specific disclosures on a basis consistent with how management currently evaluates the results of the segments. The revised reporting structure did not impact the consolidated balance sheet or the consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows. The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K is presented as of December 31, 2011 and other than as indicated above, has not been updated to reflect financial results subsequent to that date or any other changes since the date of the Annual Report.

2011 Economic and Business Environment
The banking environment and markets in which we conduct our businesses will continue to be strongly influenced by developments in the U.S. and global economies, including the results of the European Union (EU) sovereign debt crisis, continued large budget imbalances in key developed nations, and the implementation and rulemaking associated with recent financial reform. The global economy expanded at a diminished pace in 2011, with the U.S., U.K., Europe and Japan all losing momentum, while economic growth in emerging nations diminished somewhat but remained robust.
United States
The U.S. economy expanded only modestly in 2011, as a promising beginning with an improving labor market gave way to an appreciable slowdown in domestic demand early in the year. By mid-year, the labor market had slowed once more, followed by a
 
sharp reversal in the stock market and in consumer sentiment. Increasing oil prices and supply chain disruptions stemming from Japans earthquake, along with continued financial market anxiety due to the European sovereign debt crisis and difficult and protracted U.S. budget negotiations related to the federal debt ceiling, contributed to the weakness. As some of these factors dissipated, domestic demand picked up in the second half of 2011, easing U.S. recession fears. In the fourth quarter, equities rebounded from their mid-year declines, consumer confidence edged up and labor markets showed clear signs of improvement. The unemployment rate ended the year at 8.5 percent compared to 9.4 percent at December 31, 2010.
Despite subdued U.S. economic growth, year-over-year inflation drifted higher over the first three quarters of 2011, lifted in part by the surge in energy costs, before edging lower in the fourth quarter. Fears of deflation, prevalent in 2010, faded as year-over-year core inflation, which began 2011 below one percent, moved
to above two percent by year end. Nevertheless, bond yields, which drifted gradually lower in the first half of 2011, fell during a volatile third quarter amid anxiety over the European sovereign debt crisis, exacerbated by the U.S. debt ceiling debate and fears of recession. Despite the Standard & Poors Rating Services (S&P) ratings downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, mounting concerns about Europes financial crisis generated strong demand for U.S. government securities. The Federal Reserve completed its second round of quantitative easing near mid-year. Responding to sharp declines in equity markets, low consumer expectations and heightened worries about recession, the Federal Reserve adopted another financial support program in September 2011 aimed at lowering bond yields. The program involved sales of $400 billion of shorter-term (less than three years) government securities and purchases of an equal volume of longer-term (six years and over) government bonds. Bonds yields held near all-time post-Great Depression lows at year end.
Housing activity remained at historically low levels in 2011 and the supply of unsold homes remained high. Meanwhile, corporate profits continued to grow at a robust pace in 2011, despite slowing from their initial sharp rebound. After bottoming in late 2010, commercial and industrial lending also accelerated in 2011.
Europe
Europes financial crisis escalated in 2011 despite a series of initiatives by policymakers, and several European nations were experiencing recessionary conditions in the fourth quarter. Europes problems involve unsustainably high public debt in some nations, including Greece and Portugal, slow growth and significant refinancing risk related to maturing sovereign debt in Italy, and excess household debt and sharp declines in wealth stemming from falling home values following unsustainable housing bubbles in other nations, including Spain and Ireland. These national challenges are closely intertwined with the problems facing Europes banks, which are some of the largest holders of the bonds of troubled European nations. During 2011, financial markets became increasingly skeptical that government policies would resolve these problems, and risk-averse investors reduced their exposures to bonds of troubled nations, driving up their bond yields and, to varying degrees, restricting access to capital markets. This exacerbated already onerous debt service burdens. In response, European policymakers provided financial support to troubled nations through the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and purchases of sovereign debt by the European Central Bank (ECB). Despite these efforts, sharp increases in the bond yields of Spanish and Italian bonds further complicated Europes financial problems beyond the current capabilities of the EFSF. As the magnitude of the financial stresses rose, reflected in higher sovereign bond yields and mounting funding shortfalls at select banks, the ECB instituted new programs to provide low-cost, three-year loans to European banks, and expanded collateral eligibility. This served to alleviate bank funding pressures toward year end and provided greater liquidity in sovereign debt markets.
Asia
Japans economic environment in 2011 was marked by the trauma of its massive earthquake in early 2011 that caused a dramatic decline in economic activity followed by a quick rebound. A sharp decline in consumption and domestic demand was accompanied
 
by temporary production shutdowns of various intermediate and durable goods that disrupted supply chains throughout Asia and the world. The ripple effects were pronounced, although temporary, throughout Asia. China continued to grow rapidly throughout 2011, with real GDP growth exceeding nine percent, despite elevated inflation and government efforts to constrain price pressures through the tightening of monetary policy and bank credit, and regulations that limit speculation and price increases in real estate. Chinas economic growth slowed modestly in the second half of the year, reflecting in part slower growth of exports to Europe and other destinations. Chinas inflation also began to subside toward year end. Other Asian nations continued to experience strong growth rates.

Recent Events
Mortgage Related Matters
Department of Justice/Attorney General Matters
On
February 9, 2012
, we reached agreements in principle (collectively, the Servicing Resolution Agreements) with (1) the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), various federal regulatory agencies and
49
state attorneys general to resolve federal and state investigations into certain origination, servicing and foreclosure practices (the Global AIP), (2) the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to resolve certain claims relating to the origination of FHA-insured mortgage loans, primarily by Countrywide prior to and for a period following our acquisition of that lender (the FHA AIP) and (3) each of the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) regarding civil monetary penalties related to conduct that was the subject of consent orders entered into with the banking regulators in April 2011 (the Consent Order AIPs).
The Servicing Resolution Agreements are subject to ongoing discussions among the parties and completion and execution of definitive documentation, as well as required regulatory and court approvals. The FHA AIP provides for an upfront cash payment and an additional cash payment if we fail to meet certain principal reduction thresholds over a three-year period. Under the terms of the Servicing Resolution Agreements, the federal and participating state governments would provide us with releases from liability for certain alleged residential mortgage origination, servicing and foreclosure deficiencies.
The financial impact of the Servicing Resolution Agreements is not expected to require any additional reserves over existing accruals as of December 31, 2011, based on our understanding of the terms of the Servicing Resolution Agreements. The refinancing assistance commitment under the Servicing Resolution Agreements is expected to be recognized as lower interest income in future periods as qualified borrowers pay reduced interest rates on loans refinanced. The Servicing Resolution Agreements do not cover claims arising out of securitization, including representations made to investors respecting mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and certain other claims.

Private-label Securitization Settlement with the Bank of New York Mellon
On
June 28, 2011
, the Corporation, BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP (BAC HLS, which was subsequently merged with and into Bank of America, N.A. (BANA) in July 2011), and its legacy Countrywide affiliates entered into a settlement agreement with BNY Mellon, as trustee (Trustee), to resolve all outstanding and potential claims related to alleged representations and warranties breaches (including repurchase claims), substantially all historical loan servicing claims and certain other historical claims with respect to
525
legacy Countrywide first-lien and
five
second-lien non government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) residential mortgage-backed securitization trusts (the Covered Trusts) containing loans principally originated between
2004
and
2008
for which BNY Mellon acts as trustee or indenture trustee (the BNY Mellon Settlement). The BNY Mellon Settlement agreement is subject to final court approval and certain other conditions.
An investor opposed to the settlement removed the proceeding to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. On October 19, 2011, the district court denied BNY Mellons motion to remand the proceeding to state court. BNY Mellon and the Investor Group petitioned to appeal the denial of this motion and on December 27, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit accepted the appeal and stated in an amended scheduling order that, pursuant to statute, it would decide the appeal by February 27, 2012. On November 4, 2011, the district court entered a written order setting a discovery schedule, and discovery is ongoing.
It is not currently possible to predict how many of the parties who have appeared in the court proceeding will ultimately object to the BNY Mellon Settlement, whether the objections will prevent receipt of final court approval or the ultimate outcome of the court approval process, which can include appeals and could take a substantial period of time. In particular, the conduct of discovery and the resolution of the objections to the settlement and any appeals could also take a substantial period of time and these factors, along with the removal of the proceedings to federal court and the associated appeal, could materially delay the timing of final court approval. Accordingly, it is not possible to predict when the court approval process will be completed.

Capital Related Matters
We continued to sell certain business units and assets as part of our capital management and enterprise-wide initiatives. In November 2011, we sold an aggregate of approximately 10.4 billion common shares of China Construction Bank Corporation (CCB) through private transactions with investors resulting in an aggregate pre-tax gain of $2.9 billion. We currently hold approximately one percent of the outstanding common shares of CCB. The sale also generated approximately $2.9 billion of Tier 1
 
common capital and reduced our risk-weighted assets by $4.9 billion under Basel I, strengthening our Tier 1 common capital ratio by approximately 24 basis points (bps).
In December 2011, we sold our Canadian consumer card portfolio strengthening our Tier 1 common capital ratio by approximately seven bps.
In November and December 2011, we entered into separate agreements with certain institutional preferred and trust preferred security holders to exchange shares, or depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares, of various series of our outstanding preferred stock, or trust preferred or hybrid income term securities of various unconsolidated trusts, as applicable, with an aggregate liquidation preference of $5.8 billion for
400 million
shares of our common stock and
$2.3 billion
aggregate principal amount of our senior notes. In connection with the exchanges of trust preferred securities, we recorded gains of $1.2 billion. The exchanges in aggregate resulted in an increase of
$3.9 billion
in Tier 1 common capital and increased our Tier 1 common capital ratio approximately
29
bps under Basel I. For additional information regarding these exchanges, see
Note 13  Long-term Debt
and
Note 15  Shareholders Equity
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
Overall during 2011, we generated 126 bps of Tier 1 common capital and reduced risk-weighted assets by
$172 billion
, including as a result of, among other things, the exchanges of preferred stock and trust preferred or hybrid securities, our sales of CCB shares and the $5.0 billion investment in preferred stock and common stock warrant by Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (Berkshire). For additional information on the Berkshire investment, see
Note 15  Shareholders Equity
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
As credit spreads for many financial institutions, including the Corporation, have widened during the past year due to global uncertainty and volatility, the market value of debt previously issued by financial institutions has decreased. This uncertainty in the market, evidenced by, among other things, volatility in credit spreads, makes it economically advantageous to consider purchasing and retiring certain of our outstanding debt instruments. In 2012, we completed a tender offer to purchase and retire certain subordinated notes for approximately $3.4 billion in cash and will consider additional purchases in the future depending upon prevailing market conditions, liquidity and other factors. If the purchase of any debt instruments is at an amount less than the carrying value, such purchases would be accretive to earnings and capital.
We intend to continue to build capital through retaining earnings, actively reducing legacy asset portfolios and implementing other capital related initiatives, including focusing on reducing both higher risk-weighted assets and assets currently deducted, or expected to be deducted under Basel III, from capital. We expect non-core asset sales to play a less prominent role in our capital strategy in future periods. We issued approximately
122 million
of immediately tradable shares of common stock, or approximately $1.0 billion (after-tax) to certain employees in February 2012 in lieu of a portion of their 2011 year-end cash incentive. We may engage, from time to time, in privately negotiated transactions involving the issuance of common stock, cash or other consideration in exchange for preferred stock and certain trust preferred securities in amounts that are not expected to be material to us, either individually or in the aggregate.
Credit Ratings
On December 15, 2011, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) downgraded the Corporations and BANAs long-term and short-term debt ratings as a result of Fitchs decision to lower its support floor for systemically important U.S. financial institutions. On November 29, 2011, S&P downgraded our long-term and short-term debt ratings as well as BANAs long-term debt rating as a result of S&Ps implementation of revised methodologies for determining Banking Industry Country Risk Assessments and bank ratings. On September 21, 2011, Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys) downgraded our long-term and short-term debt ratings as well as BANAs long-term debt rating as a result of Moodys lowering the amount of uplift for potential U.S. government support it incorporates into ratings. On February 15, 2012, Moodys placed the Corporations long-term debt ratings and BANAs long-term and short-term debt ratings on review for possible downgrade as part of its review of financial institutions with global capital markets operations. Any adjustment to our ratings will be determined based on Moodys review; however, the agency offered guidance that downgrades to our ratings, if any, would likely be limited to one notch.
Currently, our long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies are as follows: Baa1/P-2 (negative) by Moodys, A-/A-2 (negative) by S&P and A/F1 (stable) by Fitch. The rating agencies could make further adjustments to our ratings at any time and there can be no assurance that additional downgrades will not occur.
Under the terms of certain over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts and other trading agreements, in the event of a downgrade of our credit ratings or certain subsidiaries credit ratings, counterparties to those agreements may require us or certain subsidiaries to provide additional collateral or to terminate those contracts or agreements or provide other remedies.

European Union Sovereign Credit Risks
Certain European countries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, continue to experience varying degrees of financial stress. Uncertainty in the progress of debt restructuring negotiations and the lack of a clear resolution to the crisis has led to continued volatility in European as well as global financial markets, and if the situation worsens, may further adversely affect these markets. In December 2011, the European Central Bank announced initiatives to address European bank liquidity and funding concerns by providing low-cost, three-year loans to banks, and expanding collateral eligibility. While reducing systemic risk, there remains considerable uncertainty as to future developments regarding the European debt crisis. In early 2012, S&P, Fitch and
 
Moodys downgraded the credit ratings of several European countries, and S&P downgraded the credit rating of the EFSF, adding to concerns about investor appetite for continued support in stabilizing the affected countries. Our total sovereign and non-sovereign exposure to Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, was
$15.3 billion
at December 31, 2011 compared to $16.6 billion at December 31, 2010. Our total net sovereign and non-sovereign exposure to these countries was
$10.5 billion
at December 31, 2011 compared to
$12.4 billion
at December 31, 2010, after taking into account net credit default protection. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the fair value of net credit default protection purchased was
$4.9 billion
and $4.2 billion. Losses could still result because our credit protection contracts only pay out under certain scenarios. For a further discussion of our direct sovereign and non-sovereign exposures in Europe, see

Project New BAC
Project New BAC is a two-phase, enterprise-wide initiative to simplify and streamline workflows and processes, align businesses and expenses more closely with our overall strategic plan and operating principles, and increase revenues. Phase 1 evaluations, which were completed in September 2011, focused on the consumer businesses, including
CBB
and
CRES
, and related support, technology and operations functions. Phase 2 evaluations began in October 2011 and are focused on
Global Banking
,
Global Markets
and
GWIM
, and related support, technology and operations functions not subject to evaluation in Phase 1. Phase 2 evaluations are expected to continue through April 2012.
Implementation of Phase 1 recommendations began in 2011. Phase 1 has a stated goal of a reduction of approximately 30,000 positions, with natural attrition and the elimination of unfilled positions expected to represent a significant part of the reduction. A stated goal of the full implementation of Phase 1 is to reduce certain costs by $5 billion per year by 2014 and we anticipate that more than 20 percent of these cost savings could be achieved by the end of 2012. As implementation of the Phase 1 recommendations continues and Phase 2 begins, reductions in staffing levels in the affected areas are expected to result in some incremental costs including severance.
Reductions in the areas subject to evaluation for Phase 2 have not yet been fully identified, and accordingly, potential cost savings cannot be estimated at this time; however, they are expected to be lower than Phase 1 because the businesses have lower headcount. All aspects of New BAC are expected to be implemented by the end of 2014. There were no material expenses related to New BAC recorded in 2011. For information about the risks associated with Project New BAC, see
Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K

Performance Overview
Net income was
$1.4 billion
in
2011
compared to a net loss of
$2.2 billion
in
2010
. After preferred stock dividends of
$1.4 billion
in both
2011
and
2010
, net income applicable to common shareholders was
$85 million
, or
$0.01
per diluted common share in
2011
compared to a net loss of
$3.6 billion
, or
$0.37
per diluted common share in
2010
. The principal contributors to the pre-tax net income in
2011
were the following: gains of
$6.5 billion
on the sale of CCB shares (we currently hold approximately one percent of the outstanding common shares), a
$7.4 billion
reduction in the allowance for credit losses,
$3.4 billion
of gains on sales of debt securities, positive fair value adjustments of
$3.3 billion
related to our own credit spreads on structured liabilities, a
$1.2 billion
gain on the exchange of certain trust preferred securities for common stock and debt and DVA gains on derivatives of
$1.0 billion
, net of hedges. These contributors were offset by
$15.6 billion
in representations and warranties provision, litigation expense of $5.6 billion, goodwill impairment charges of
$3.2 billion
, $1.8 billion of mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs, and
$1.1 billion
of impairment charges on our merchant services joint venture.
 
Net interest income on a FTE basis
decreased
$7.1 billion
in
2011
to
$45.6 billion
. The
decline
was primarily due to lower consumer loan balances and yields and decreased investment security yields. Lower trading-related net interest income also negatively impacted
2011
results. These decreases were partially offset by ongoing reductions in our debt footprint and lower rates paid on deposits. The net interest yield on a FTE basis was
2.48
percent for
2011
compared to
2.78
percent for
2010
.
Noninterest income
decreased
$9.9 billion
in
2011
to
$48.8 billion
. The most significant contributors to the decline were lower mortgage banking income, down
$11.6 billion
largely due to higher representations and warranties provision, and a decrease of
$3.4 billion
in trading account profits. These declines were partially offset by the gains on the sale of CCB shares and higher positive fair value adjustments related to our own credit on structured liabilities in
2011
. In addition, in connection with separate agreements with certain trust preferred security holders to exchange their holdings for common stock and senior notes, we recorded gains of
$1.2 billion
in
2011
. For additional information on these exchange agreements, see
Note 13  Long-term Debt
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
The provision for credit losses
decreased
$15.0 billion
in
2011
to
$13.4 billion
. The provision for credit losses was $7.4 billion lower than net charge-offs for
2011
, resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses, as portfolio trends continued to improve across most of the consumer and commercial businesses, particularly the U.S. credit card, unsecured consumer lending and commercial real estate portfolios partially offset by additions to consumer purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loan portfolio reserves. This compared to a
$5.9 billion
reduction in the allowance for credit losses in
2010
.
Noninterest expense
decreased
$2.8 billion
in
2011
to
$80.3 billion
. The decline was driven by a
$9.2 billion
decrease in goodwill impairment charges and a
$1.2 billion
decline in merger and restructuring charges in
2011
. Partially offsetting these decreases was a
$4.9 billion
increase in other general operating expense which included increases of
$3.0 billion
in litigation expense and
$1.6 billion
in mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs, and an
increase
of
$1.8 billion
in personnel costs due to the continued build-out of certain businesses, technology costs as well as increases in default-related servicing costs.
The income tax benefit on a FTE basis was
$704 million
on the pre-tax income of
$742 million
for
2011
compared to income tax expense on a FTE basis of
$2.1 billion
on the pre-tax loss of
$153 million
for
2010
. For more information, see

Segment Results
The following discussion provides an overview of the results of our business segments and
All Other
for
2011
compared to
2010
. For additional information on these results, see
Business Segment Operations
on page
16
.
CBB
net income increased compared to the prior year primarily due to a
$10.4 billion
non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge and a decrease in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decline in revenue. The decline in revenue was primarily driven by lower average loan balances and yields, lower service charges reflecting the impact of overdraft policy changes in conjunction with Regulation E that were fully implemented during the third quarter of 2010, the implementation of the Durbin Amendment in the fourth quarter of 2011, the absence of the gain on the sale of our MasterCard position in 2010 and the implementation of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD Act).
CRES
net loss
increased
compared to the prior year primarily due to a
decline
in revenue and an
increase
in noninterest expense. Revenue
declined
due to an
increase
in representations and warranties provision,
lower
core production income and a
decrease
in insurance income due to the sale of Balboa Insurance Companys lender-placed insurance business (Balboa). Noninterest expense
increased
due to higher litigation expense, increased mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs, higher default-related and other loss mitigation expenses and a higher non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge, partially offset by lower insurance and production expenses.
Global Banking
net income
increased
compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in the provision for credit losses. Revenue
decreased
primarily driven by
lower
net interest income related to asset and liability management (ALM) activities and lower accretion on acquired portfolios, partially offset by the impact of higher average loan and deposit balances. The
decrease
in the provision for credit losses was driven by the positive impact of the economic environment on the credit portfolio and an accelerated rate of loan resolutions in the commercial real estate portfolio.
Global Markets
net income
decreased
compared to the prior year driven by a
decline
in sales and trading revenue due to a challenging market environment, partially offset by DVA gains, net of hedges. Higher noninterest expense was driven primarily by increased costs related to investments in infrastructure. Income tax expense included a charge related to the U.K. corporate income tax rate changes enacted during the year to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax assets.
 
GWIM
net income
increased
compared to the prior year driven by higher net interest income, higher asset management fees and lower credit costs, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Revenue
increased
driven by higher asset management fees from higher market levels and long-term assets under management (AUM) flows as well as higher net interest income. The provision for credit losses
decreased
driven by improving portfolio trends. Noninterest expense
increased
due to higher volume-driven expenses and personnel costs associated with the continued investment in the business.
All Other
net income
increased
compared to the prior year primarily due to higher noninterest income and lower merger and restructuring charges. Noninterest income increased due to an increase in the positive fair value adjustments related to our own credit spreads on structured liabilities as well as the gain on the sale of CCB shares in 2011. The provision for credit losses
decreased
primarily due to divestitures, improvements in delinquencies, collections and insolvencies in the non-U.S. credit card portfolio and continued run-off in the legacy Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (Merrill Lynch) commercial portfolio.
Financial Highlights
Net Interest Income
Net interest income on a FTE basis
decreased
$7.1 billion
to
$45.6 billion
for
2011
compared to
2010
. The
decline
was primarily due to lower consumer loan balances and yields and decreased investment security yields, including the acceleration of purchase premium amortization from an increase in modeled prepayment expectations, and increased hedge ineffectiveness. Lower trading-related net interest income also negatively impacted
2011
results. These decreases were partially offset by ongoing reductions in our debt footprint and lower interest rates paid on deposits. The net interest yield on a FTE basis
decreased
30
 bps to
2.48 percent
for
2011
compared to
2010
as the yield continues to be under pressure due to the aforementioned items and the low rate environment. We expect net interest income to continue to be muted based on the current forward yield curve in 2012.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income
decreased
$9.9 billion
to
$48.8 billion
for
2011
compared to
2010
. The following highlights the significant changes.
 
six months ended June 30, 2011 compared to $1.4 billion for
2010
.
Provision for Credit Losses
The provision for credit losses
decreased
$15.0 billion
to
$13.4 billion
for
2011
compared to
2010
. The provision for credit losses was
$7.4 billion
lower than net charge-offs for
2011
, resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses driven primarily by lower delinquencies, improved collection rates and fewer bankruptcy filings across the U.S. credit card and unsecured consumer lending portfolios, and improvement in overall credit quality in the commercial real estate portfolio partially offset by additions to consumer PCI loan portfolio reserves. This compared to a
$5.9 billion
reduction in the allowance for credit losses in
2010
. We expect reductions in the allowance for credit losses to be lower in 2012.
The provision for credit losses related to our consumer portfolio decreased $11.1 billion to $14.3 billion for
2011
compared to
2010
. The provision for credit losses related to our commercial portfolio including the provision for unfunded lending commitments decreased $3.9 billion to a benefit of $915 million for
2011
compared to
2010
.
Net charge-offs totaled
$20.8 billion
, or
2.24 percent
of average loans and leases for
2011
compared to
$34.3 billion
, or
3.60 percent
for
2010
. The
decrease
in net charge-offs was primarily driven by improvements in general economic conditions that resulted in lower delinquencies, improved collection rates and fewer bankruptcy filings across the U.S. credit card and unsecured consumer lending portfolios as well as lower losses in the home equity portfolio driven primarily by fewer delinquent loans. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see
Provision for Credit Losses
on page 
85
.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense
decreased
$2.8 billion
to
$80.3 billion
for
2011
compared to
2010
. The prior year included goodwill impairment charges of
$12.4 billion
compared to
$3.2 billion
for
2011
.
Personnel expense
increased
$1.8 billion
for
2011
attributable to personnel costs related to the continued build-out of certain businesses, technology costs as well as increases in default-related servicing. Additionally, professional fees
increased
$686 million
related to consulting fees for regulatory initiatives as well as higher legal expenses. Other general operating expenses
increased
$4.9 billion
largely as a result of a
$3.0 billion
increase in litigation expense, primarily mortgage-related, and an increase of
$1.6 billion
in mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs. Merger and restructuring expenses
decreased
$1.2 billion
in
2011
.
Income Tax Expense
The income tax
benefit
was
$1.7 billion
on the pre-tax
loss
of
$230 million
for
2011
compared to income tax
expense
of
$915 million
on the pre-tax
loss
of
$1.3 billion
for
2010
. These amounts are
 
before FTE adjustments. The effective tax rate for
2011
was not meaningful due to a small pre-tax loss, and for
2010
, due to the impact of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges of
$12.4 billion
.
The income tax benefit for
2011
was driven by recurring tax preference items, such as tax-exempt income and affordable housing credits, a $1.0 billion benefit from the release of the remaining valuation allowance applicable to the Merrill Lynch capital loss carryover deferred tax asset, and a benefit of $823 million for planned realization of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets related to the tax basis in certain subsidiaries. These benefits were partially offset by the $782 million tax charge for the U.K. corporate income tax rate reductions referred to below. The $3.2 billion of goodwill impairment charges recorded in
2011
were non-deductible.
The effective tax rate for
2010
excluding goodwill impairment charges from pre-tax income was 8.3 percent. In addition to our recurring tax preference items, this rate was driven by a $1.7 billion benefit from the release of a portion of the valuation allowance applicable to the Merrill Lynch capital loss carryover deferred tax asset, partially offset by the $392 million charge from a one percent reduction to the U.K. corporate income tax rate enacted during
2010
.
On July 19, 2011, the U.K.
2011
Finance Bill was enacted which reduced the corporate income tax rate one percent to 26 percent beginning on April 1, 2011, and then to 25 percent effective April 1, 2012. These rate reductions will favorably affect income tax expense on future U.K. earnings but also required us to remeasure our U.K. net deferred tax assets using the lower tax rates. As noted above, the income tax
benefit
for
2011
included a $782 million charge for the remeasurement, substantially all of which was recorded in
Global Markets
. If corporate income tax rates were to be reduced to 23 percent by 2014 as suggested in U.K. Treasury announcements and assuming no change in the deferred tax asset balance, a charge to income tax expense of approximately $400 million for each one percent reduction in the rate would result in each period of enactment (for a total of approximately $800 million).
Balance Sheet Overview
At
December 31, 2011
, total assets were
$2.1 trillion
, a
decrease
of
$136 billion
, or
six percent
, from
December 31, 2010
. Average total assets
decreased
$143 billion
in
2011
. At
December 31, 2011
, total liabilities were
$1.9 trillion
, a
decrease
of
$138 billion
, or
seven percent
, from
December 31, 2010
. Average total liabilities
decreased
$139 billion
in
2011
.
Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities, primarily involving our portfolios of highly liquid assets, that are designed to ensure the adequacy of capital while enhancing our ability to manage liquidity requirements for the Corporation and for our customers, and to position the balance sheet in accordance with the Corporations risk appetite. The execution of these activities requires the use of balance sheet and capital-related limits including spot, average and risk-weighted asset limits, particularly in our trading businesses. One of our key metrics, Tier 1 leverage ratio, is calculated based on adjusted quarterly average total assets.
Assets
Federal Funds Sold and Securities Borrowed or Purchased Under Agreements to Resell
Federal funds transactions involve lending reserve balances on a short-term basis. Securities borrowed and securities purchased under agreements to resell are utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn interest rate spreads and obtain securities for settlement. Average federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell
decreased
$11.9 billion
, or
five percent
, in
2011
attributable to an overall decline in balance sheet usage.
Trading Account Assets
Trading account assets consist primarily of fixed-income securities including government and corporate debt, and equity and convertible instruments. Year-end trading account assets
 
decreased
$25.4 billion
in
2011
primarily due to actions to reduce risk on the balance sheet. Average trading account assets
decreased
$26.4 billion
in
2011
primarily due to a reclassification of noninterest-earning equity securities from trading account assets to other assets for average balance sheet purposes.
Debt Securities
Debt securities primarily include U.S. Treasury and agency securities, MBS, principally agency MBS, foreign bonds, corporate bonds and municipal debt. We use the debt securities portfolio primarily to manage interest rate and liquidity risk and to take advantage of market conditions that create more economically attractive returns on these investments. Year-end balances of debt securities
decreased
$26.6 billion
due to agency MBS sales in
2011
. Average balances of debt securities
increased
$13.2 billion
due to agency MBS purchases in the second half of
2010
and the first three quarters of
2011
. For additional information on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, see
Note 5  Securities
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
Loans and Leases
Year-end and average loans and leases
decreased
$14.2 billion
to
$926.2 billion
and
$20.2 billion
to
$938.1 billion
in
2011
. The decrease was primarily due to consumer portfolio run-off outpacing new originations and loan portfolio sales, partially offset by non-U.S. commercial growth as international demand continues to remain high. For a more detailed discussion of the loan portfolio, see
Note 6  Outstanding Loans and Leases
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses
Year-end and average allowance for loan lease losses
decreased
$8.1 billion
and
$8.0 billion
in
2011
primarily due to the impact of the improving economy partially offset by reserve additions in the PCI portfolio throughout
2011
. For a more detailed discussion of the
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses
, see page 
86
.
All Other Assets
Year-end and average other assets
decreased
$79.3 billion
and
$105.9 billion
in
2011
driven primarily by the sale of strategic investments, a reduction in loans held-for-sale (LHFS) and lower mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). Average other assets was also impacted by lower cash balances held at the Federal Reserve.
Liabilities
Deposits
Year-end and average deposits
increased
$22.6 billion
and
$47.2 billion
to
$1.0 trillion
in
2011
. The increase was attributable to growth in our noninterest-bearing deposits.
Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Loaned or Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase
Federal funds transactions involve borrowing reserve balances on a short-term basis. Securities loaned and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are collateralized borrowing transactions utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn interest rate spreads and finance assets on the balance sheet. Year-end and average federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase
decreased
$30.5 billion
and
$81.3 billion
in
2011
primarily due to planned funding reductions.
Trading Account Liabilities
Trading account liabilities consist primarily of short positions in fixed-income securities including government and corporate debt, equity and convertible instruments. Year-end and average trading account liabilities
decreased
$11.5 billion
and
$7.0 billion
in
2011
in line with declines in trading account assets.
Commercial Paper and Other Short-term Borrowings
Commercial paper and other short-term borrowings provide an additional funding source. Year-end and average commercial paper and other short-term borrowings
decreased
$24.3 billion
to
$35.7 billion
and
$24.8 billion
to
$51.9 billion
in
2011
due to planned reductions in wholesale borrowings. During 2011, we reduced to an insignificant amount our use of unsecured short-term borrowings including commercial paper and master notes.
Long-term Debt
Year-end and average long-term debt
decreased
$76.2 billion
to
$372.3 billion
and
$69.3 billion
to
$421.2 billion
in
2011
. The
decreases
were attributable to the Corporations strategy to reduce our debt footprint. For additional information on long-term debt,
 
see
Note 13  Long-term Debt
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
All Other Liabilities
Year-end all other liabilities
decreased
$17.9 billion
in
2011
driven primarily by a decline in the liability related to collateral held, a decrease in lower customer margin credits and liquidation of a consolidated variable interest entity (VIE).
Shareholders Equity
Year-end shareholders equity
increased
$1.9 billion
. The increase was driven primarily by the investment by Berkshire, exchanges of certain preferred securities for common stock and debt and positive earnings. Average shareholders equity
decreased
$4.1 billion
in
2011
primarily driven by losses late in
2010
.
Cash Flows Overview
The Corporations operating assets and liabilities support our global markets and lending activities. We believe that cash flows from operations, available cash balances and our ability to generate cash through short- and long-term debt are sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs. Our investing activities primarily include the AFS securities portfolio and other short-term investments. Our financing activities reflect cash flows primarily related to increased customer deposits and net long-term debt repayments.
Cash and cash equivalents
increased
$11.7 billion
during
2011
due to sales of non-core assets and net sales of AFS securities partially offset by repayment and maturities of certain long-term debt. Cash and cash equivalents
decreased
$12.9 billion
during
2010
due to repayment and maturities of certain long-term debt and net purchases of AFS securities partially offset by deposit growth.
During
2011
, net cash provided by operating activities was
$64.5 billion
compared to
$82.6 billion
in
2010
. The more significant adjustments to net income (loss) to arrive at cash provided by operating activities included the provision for credit losses, goodwill impairment charges and the net decrease in trading and derivative instruments.
During
2011
, net cash provided by investing activities increased to
$52.4 billion
primarily driven by net sales of debt securities. During
2010
, net cash of
$30.3 billion
was used in investing activities primarily for net purchases of debt securities.
During
2011
and
2010
, the net cash used in financing activities of
$104.7 billion
and
$65.4 billion
primarily reflected the net decreases in long-term debt as maturities outpaced new issuances.

Supplemental Financial Data
We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on a FTE basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe managing the business with net interest income on a FTE basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.
As mentioned above, certain performance measures including the efficiency ratio and net interest yield utilize net interest income (and thus total revenue) on a FTE basis. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield measures the bps we earn over the cost of funds.
We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents an adjusted shareholders equity or common shareholders equity amount which has been reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use Return on average tangible shareholders equity (ROTE) as key measures to support our overall growth goals.
 
MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities.
In addition, we evaluate our business segment results based on measures that utilize return on average economic capital, a non-GAAP financial measure, including the following:
The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Tables
7
and
8
and Statistical Tables XII and XIV. In addition, in Table
8
and Statistical Table XIV, we have excluded the impact of goodwill impairment charges of
$3.2 billion
and
$12.4 billion
recorded in
2011
and
2010
when presenting certain of these metrics. Accordingly, these are non-GAAP financial measures.
Statistical Tables XV, XVI and XVII provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures defined by GAAP. We believe the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation and our segments. Other companies may define or calculate these measures and ratios differently.
Core Net Interest Income
We manage core net interest income which is reported net interest income on a FTE basis adjusted for the impact of market-based activities. As discussed in the
Global Markets
business segment section on page 
26
, we evaluate our market-based results and strategies on a total market-based revenue approach by combining net interest income and noninterest income for
Global Markets
.
 
An analysis of core net interest income, core average earning assets and core net interest yield on earning assets, all of which adjust for the impact of market-based activities from reported net interest income on a FTE basis, is shown below. We believe the use of this non-GAAP presentation in
Table 9
provides additional clarity in assessing our results.
Core net interest income
decreased
$6.5 billion
to
$41.8 billion
for
2011
compared to
2010
. The
decline
was primarily due to lower consumer loan balances and yields and decreased investment security yields, including the acceleration of purchase premium amortization from an increase in modeled prepayment expectations and increased hedge ineffectiveness. These decreases were partially offset by ongoing reductions in our debt footprint and lower interest rates paid on deposits.
Core average earning assets
increased
$1.1 billion
to
$1,385.9 billion
for
2011
compared to
2010
. The
increase
was primarily due to growth in investment securities partially offset by declines in consumer loans.
Core net interest yield
decreased
48
 bps to
3.01 percent
for
2011
compared to
2010
primarily due to the factors noted above. In addition, the yield curve flattened significantly with long-term rates near historical lows at
December 31, 2011
. This has resulted in net interest yield compression as assets have repriced down and liability yields have declined less significantly due to the absolute low level of short-end rates.
Business Segment Operations
Segment Description and Basis of Presentation
We report the results of our operations through five business segments:
CBB,
CRES
, Global Banking, Global Markets
and
GWIM
, with the remaining operations recorded in
All Other
. Effective January 1, 2012, we changed the basis of presentation from six to the above five segments. The former
Deposits
and
Card Services
segments, as well as Business Banking, which was included in the former
Global Commercial Banking
segment, are now reflected in
CBB
. The former
Global Commercial Banking
segment was combined with the Global Corporate and Investment Banking business, which was included in the former
Global Banking & Markets (GBAM)
segment, to form
Global Banking.
The remaining global markets business of
GBAM
is now reported as a separate
Global Markets
segment
.
In addition, certain management accounting methodologies and related allocations were refined. Prior period results have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
We prepare and evaluate segment results using certain non-GAAP financial measures, many of which are discussed in
Supplemental Financial Data
on page 
15
. We begin by evaluating
 
the operating results of the segments which by definition exclude merger and restructuring charges.
The management accounting and reporting process derives segment and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies for revenue and expense. The net income derived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the business.
Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on a FTE basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to a FTE basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies that are utilized to determine net income. The net interest income of the businesses includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. For presentation purposes, in segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, we allocate assets to match liabilities. Net interest income of the business segments also includes an allocation of net interest income generated by certain of our ALM activities.
Our ALM activities include an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of various derivatives and cash instruments to manage fluctuations in earnings and capital that are caused by interest rate volatility. Our goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. The majority of our ALM activities are allocated to the business segments and fluctuate based on performance. ALM activities include external product pricing decisions including deposit pricing strategies, the effects of our internal funds transfer pricing process and the net effects of other ALM activities.
Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific business segment are allocated to the segments. The most significant of these expenses include data and item processing costs and certain centralized or shared functions. Data processing costs are allocated to the segments based on equipment usage. Item processing costs are allocated to the segments based on the volume of items processed for each segment. The costs of certain centralized or shared functions are allocated based on methodologies that reflect utilization.
Equity is allocated to business segments and related businesses using a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segments credit, market, interest rate, strategic and operational risk components. The nature of these risks is discussed further on page 
45
. We benefit from the diversification of risk across these components which is reflected as a reduction to allocated equity for each segment. The total amount of average allocated equity reflects both risk-based capital and the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the business segments. The risk-adjusted methodology is periodically refined and such refinements are reflected as changes to allocated equity in each segment.

Consumer & Business Banking
n/m = not meaningful
CBB,
which is comprised of our Deposits, Card Services and Business Banking businesses, offers a diversified range of credit, banking and investment products and services to consumers and businesses. Our customers and clients have access to a franchise network that stretches coast to coast through 32 states and the District of Columbia. The franchise network includes approximately 5,700 banking centers, 17,750 ATMs, nationwide call centers, and online and mobile platforms. During 2011, we sold our Canadian consumer card business and we are evaluating our remaining international consumer card operations. In light of these actions, the international consumer card business results were moved to
All Other
and prior periods have been reclassified.
CBB
recorded net income of
$7.5 billion
in
2011
compared to a net loss of
$5.1 billion
in 2010. The improvement was due to a
$10.4 billion
goodwill impairment charge in Card Services in 2010 and a
decrease
in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decline in revenue. Net interest income
decreased
$2.9 billion
 
to
$21.4 billion
in
2011
primarily in Card Services. Noninterest income
decreased
$2.4 billion
to
$11.5 billion
in
2011
due to
declines
of
$1.3 billion
and
$1.1 billion
in noninterest income in Card Services and Deposits. The provision for credit losses
decreased
$8.2 billion
to
$3.5 billion
in
2011
primarily driven by an improvement in Card Services. Noninterest expense
declined
$10.9 billion
to
$17.7 billion
in
2011
primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge in 2010 and lower litigation and operating expenses partially offset by an increase in FDIC expense.
The return on average economic capital
increased
due to higher net income and a decrease in average economic capital primarily within Card Services. Average economic capital
decreased
17 percent
due to lower levels of credit risk from a decline in loan balances as well as an improvement in credit quality. Average allocated equity decreased primarily due to the
$10.4 billion
goodwill impairment charge in
2010
as well as the same reasons as the decrease in average economic capital. For more information
regarding economic capital and allocated equity, see
Supplemental Financial Data
on page

.
Deposits
Deposits includes the results of consumer deposit activities which consist of a comprehensive range of products provided to consumers and small businesses. Our deposit products include traditional savings accounts, money market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, noninterest- and interest-bearing checking accounts, as well as investment accounts and products. Deposit products provide a relatively stable source of funding and liquidity for the Corporation. We earn net interest spread revenue from investing this liquidity in earning assets through client-facing lending and ALM activities. The revenue is allocated to the deposit products using our funds transfer pricing process which takes into account the interest rates and implied maturity of the deposits.
Deposits also generates fees such as account service fees, non-sufficient funds fees, overdraft charges and ATM fees, as well as investment and brokerage fees from Merrill Edge accounts. Merrill Edge is an integrated investing and banking service targeted at clients with less than $250,000 in total assets. Merrill Edge provides team-based investment advice and guidance, brokerage services, a self-directed online investing platform and key banking capabilities including access to the Corporations network of banking centers and ATMs. Deposits includes the net impact of migrating customers and their related deposit balances between Deposits and other client-managed businesses.
Net income for Deposits
decreased
$164 million
to
$1.2 billion
in
2011
compared to
2010
due to a
decrease
in revenue partially offset by a
decrease
in noninterest expense. Revenue of
$12.7 billion
was
down
$873 million
from a year ago primarily driven by a decline in service charges reflecting the impact of overdraft policy changes in conjunction with Regulation E that were fully implemented during the third quarter of 2010. This was partially offset by an
increase
in net interest income due to a customer shift to more liquid products and continued pricing discipline. Noninterest expense
decreased
$572 million
, or
five percent
, to
$10.6 billion
due to lower litigation and operating expenses partially offset by an increase in FDIC expense.
Average deposits
increased
$6.2 billion
from a year ago driven by a customer shift to more liquid products in a low interest rate environment as checking, traditional savings and money market savings grew $23.6 billion. Growth in liquid products was partially offset by a decline in average time deposits of $17.4 billion. As a result of the shift in the mix of deposits and our continued pricing discipline, rates paid on average deposits declined by 16 bps to 27 bps in
2011
compared to
2010
.
Card Services
Card Services is one of the leading issuers of credit and debit cards in the U.S. to consumers and small businesses. In addition to earning net interest spread revenue on its lending activities, Card Services generates interchange revenue from credit and debit card transactions as well as annual credit card fees and other miscellaneous fees. During
2011
, we sold our Canadian consumer card business and we are evaluating our remaining international consumer card operations. In light of these actions, the international consumer card business results were moved to
All Other
and prior period results have been reclassified.
During
2010
and
2011
, Card Services was negatively impacted by provisions of the CARD Act. The majority of the provisions of
 
the CARD Act became effective on February 22, 2010, while certain provisions became effective in the third quarter of 2010. The CARD Act has negatively impacted net interest income due to restrictions on our ability to reprice credit cards based on risk and card income due to restrictions imposed on certain fees.
On June 29, 2011, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule with respect to the Durbin Amendment, effective October 1, 2011, that established the maximum allowable interchange fees a bank can receive for a debit card transaction. The Federal Reserve also adopted a rule to allow a debit card issuer to recover one cent per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud-related requirements, with which we are currently in compliance. In addition, the Federal Reserve approved rules governing routing and exclusivity, requiring issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product, which became effective on April 1, 2012. For more information on the final interchange rules, see
Regulatory Matters
on page
43
. The new interchange fee rules resulted in a reduction of debit card revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011 of
$430 million
.
Net income for Card Services
increased
$12.8 billion
to
$5.8 billion
in
2011
primarily due to the
$10.4 billion
goodwill impairment charge in
2010
, and a
$7.9 billion
decrease
in the provision for credit losses in
2011
. This was partially offset by a
decrease
in revenue of
$4.2 billion
, or
19 percent
, to
$18.1 billion
in
2011
compared to
2010
.
Net interest income
decreased
$2.9 billion
, or
20 percent
, to
$11.5 billion
in
2011
driven by lower average loan balances and yields. The net interest yield
decreased
81
bps to
9.04 percent
due to charge-offs and paydowns of higher interest rate products. Noninterest income
decreased
$1.3 billion
, or
16 percent
, to
$6.6 billion
in
2011
due to the implementation of the Durbin Amendment on October 1, 2011, the gain on the sale of our MasterCard position in
2010
and the implementation of the CARD Act in
2010
.
The provision for credit losses
decreased
$7.9 billion
to
$3.1 billion
in
2011
reflecting improving delinquencies and collections, and fewer bankruptcies as a result of improving economic conditions, and lower loan balances. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see
Provision for Credit Losses
on page
85
.
Average loans
decreased
$19.0 billion
, or
13 percent
, in
2011
driven by higher payments, charge-offs, continued run-off of non-core portfolios and the impact of portfolio divestitures during
2011
.
Business Banking
Business Banking provides a wide range of lending-related products and services, integrated working capital management and treasury solutions to clients through our network of offices and client relationship teams along with various product partners. Our clients include U.S. based companies generally with annual sales of $1 million to $50 million. Our lending products and services include commercial loans, lines of credit and real estate lending. Our capital management and treasury solutions include treasury management, foreign exchange and short-term investing options.
Effective in 2011, management responsibility for the merchant processing joint venture, Banc of America Merchant Services, LLC, was moved from
Global Banking
to Business Banking where it more closely aligns with the business model. Prior periods have been reclassified to reflect this change. In
2011
, we recorded $1.1 billion of impairment charges on our investment in the joint venture.
Because of the recent transfer of the joint venture to Business Banking, the impairment charges were recorded in
All Other
. For additional information, see
Note 5 - Securities
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Net income for Business Banking
decreased
$23 million
to
$414 million
in
2011
compared to 2010. A
$238 million
decrease
in revenue was offset by a
$239 million
decrease
in the provision for credit losses in
2011
.
Net interest income
decreased
$208 million
, or
13 percent
, to
$1.4 billion
in
2011
driven by a decrease in average loan balances. Noninterest income of
$664 million
in
2011
remained in line with
 
results from a year ago.
The provision for credit losses
decreased
$239 million
to
$245 million
in
2011
as a result of improved asset quality and lower average loan balances. Noninterest expense remained in line with results from a year ago.
Average loans
decreased
$3.1 billion
, or
10 percent
, in
2011
driven primarily by higher prepayments. Average deposits
increased
$4.2 billion
, or
12 percent

due to the net transfer of certain deposits from other businesses and the current client preference for liquidity.
Consumer Real Estate Services
n/m = not meaningful
n/a = not applicable
CRES
operations include Home Loans and Legacy Assets & Servicing. This alignment allows
CRES
management to lead the ongoing home loan business while also providing greater focus on legacy mortgage issues and servicing activities. Effective January 1, 2012, servicing activities previously recorded in Home Loans were moved to Legacy Assets & Servicing, and results of MSR activities, including net hedge results, and goodwill were moved from what was formerly referred to as Other within
CRES
to Legacy Assets & Servicing. Amounts for 2011 have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
CRES
generates revenue by providing an extensive line of consumer real estate products and services to customers nationwide.
CRES
products offered by Home Loans include fixed- and adjustable-rate first-lien mortgage loans for home purchase and refinancing needs, home equity lines of credit (HELOC) and home equity loans. First mortgage products are either sold into the secondary mortgage market to investors, while we retain MSRs and the Bank of America customer relationships, or are held on our balance sheet in
All Other
for ALM purposes. HELOC and home equity loans are retained on the
CRES
balance sheet in Home Loans and Legacy Assets & Servicing.
CRES
, through Legacy Assets & Servicing, services mortgage loans, including those
 
loans it owns, loans owned by other business segments and
All Other,
and loans owned by outside investors.
The financial results of the on-balance sheet loans are reported in the business segment that owns the loans or
All Other
.
CRES
is not impacted by the Corporations first mortgage production retention decisions as
CRES
is compensated for loans held for ALM purposes on a management accounting basis, with a corresponding offset recorded in
All Other,
and is also compensated for servicing loans owned by other business segments and
All Other
.
CRES
includes the impact of transferring customers and their related loan balances between
GWIM
and
CRES
based on client segmentation thresholds. For more information on the migration of customer balances, see
GWIM
on page
29
.
Home Loans
Home Loans products are available to our customers through our retail network of approximately
5,700
banking centers, mortgage loan officers in approximately 500 locations and a sales force offering our customers direct telephone and online access to our products. These products were also offered through our correspondent lending channel; however, we exited this channel
in late 2011. In 2011, we also exited the reverse mortgage origination business. In October 2010, we exited the first mortgage wholesale acquisition channel. These strategic changes were made to allow greater focus on our direct to consumer channels, deepen relationships with existing customers and use mortgage products to acquire new relationships.
Home Loans includes ongoing loan production activities and the
CRES
home equity portfolio not originally selected for inclusion in the Legacy Assets & Servicing portfolio. Home Loans also included insurance operations through June 30, 2011, when the ongoing insurance business was transferred to
CBB
following the sale of Balboa.
The composition of the Home Loans loan portfolio, which excludes the Legacy Assets & Servicing portfolio established as of January 1, 2011, does not currently reflect a normalized level of credit losses which we expect will develop over time.
Legacy Assets & Servicing
Legacy Assets & Servicing is responsible for servicing the residential, home equity and discontinued real estate loan portfolios, including owned loans and loans serviced for others. Legacy Assets & Servicing is also responsible for managing mortgage-related legacy exposures, including exposures related to selected owned residential mortgage, home equity and discontinued real estate loan portfolios (collectively, the Legacy Assets & Servicing portfolio). For additional information, see Legacy Assets & Servicing Portfolio.
Legacy Assets & Servicing results reflect the net cost of legacy exposures that are included in the results of
CRES
, including representations and warranties provision, litigation costs, financial results of the
CRES
home equity portfolio selected as part of the Legacy Assets & Servicing portfolio, the financial results of the servicing operations and the results of MSR activities, including net hedge results, together with any related assets or liabilities used as economic hedges. The financial results of the servicing operations reflect certain revenues and expenses on loans serviced for others, including owned loans serviced for Home Loans and
All Other.
Legacy Assets & Servicing is compensated for servicing such loans on a management accounting basis with a corresponding offset recorded in Home Loans and
All Other
.
Legacy Assets & Servicing also includes the results of MSR activities, including net hedge results. The change in the value of the MSRs in 2011 reflects the change in discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions, as well as the effect of changes in other assumptions, including the cost to service. For additional information on MSRs, see
Note 25  Mortgage Servicing Rights
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
Servicing activities include collecting cash for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers, and disbursing customer draws for lines of credit and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors and escrow payments to third parties along with responding to customer inquiries. Our home retention efforts are also part of our servicing activities, along with supervising foreclosures and property dispositions. In an effort to help our customers avoid foreclosure, Legacy Assets & Servicing evaluates various workout options prior to foreclosure sales which, combined with our temporary halt of foreclosures announced in October 2010, has resulted in elongated default timelines. Although we have resumed foreclosure proceedings in nearly all states, there continues to be a backlog of foreclosure inventory. For additional information on our servicing activities, including the impact of foreclosure delays, see

Goodwill that was assigned to
CRES
totaling
$2.6 billion
was included in Legacy Assets & Servicing and was written off in its entirety in 2011.
Legacy Assets & Servicing Portfolio
The Legacy Assets & Servicing portfolio includes owned residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and discontinued real estate loans that would not have been originated under our underwriting standards at December 31, 2010. The Countrywide PCI portfolio as well as certain loans that met a pre-defined delinquency status or probability of default threshold as of January 1, 2011 are also included in the Legacy Assets & Servicing portfolio. The residential mortgage and discontinued real estate loans are held primarily on the balance sheet of
All Other
and the home equity loans are held in Legacy Assets & Servicing. Since determining the pool of owned loans to be included in the Legacy Assets & Servicing portfolio as of January 1, 2011, the criteria have not changed for this portfolio. However, the criteria for inclusion of certain assets and liabilities in the Legacy Assets & Servicing portfolio will continue to be evaluated over time.
The total owned loans in the Legacy Assets & Servicing portfolio
decreased
$15.7 billion
in 2011 to
$154.9 billion
at
December 31, 2011
, of which
$60.0 billion
are reflected on the balance sheet of Legacy Assets & Servicing within
CRES

CRES
Results
The
CRES
net loss
increased
$10.6 billion
to
$19.5 billion
in 2011 compared to 2010. Revenue
declined
$13.5 billion
to
a loss of
$3.2 billion
due in large part to a
decrease
of
$11.4 billion
in mortgage banking income driven by an
increase
in representations and warranties provision of
$8.8 billion
and a
decrease
in core production income of
$3.4 billion
in 2011.
The representations and warranties provision in 2011 included
$8.6 billion
related to the BNY Mellon Settlement and
$7.0 billion
related to other exposures. For additional information on representations and warranties, see
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  Representations and Warranties
on page
33
and
Note 9  Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
. The
decrease
in core production income was due to a decline in loan funding volume caused primarily by a drop in market share, which reflected decisions to price certain loan products in order to align the volume of new loan applications with our underwriting capacity in both the retail and correspondent channels and our exit from the correspondent channel in late 2011. Also contributing to the
decline
in revenue was a
$1.3 billion
decrease
in insurance income due to the sale of Balboa in 2011 and a
decline
in net interest income primarily due to lower average LHFS balances. Revenue for 2011 also included a pre-tax gain on the sale of Balboa of $752 million, net of an inter-segment advisory fee.
The provision for credit losses
decreased
$4.0 billion
to
$4.5 billion
in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily driven by improving portfolio trends, including lower reserve additions in the Countrywide PCI home equity portfolio.
Noninterest expense
increased
$7.0 billion
to
$21.8 billion
in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a
$3.6 billion
increase
in litigation expense,
$1.6 billion
higher mortgage-related
assessments and waivers costs, higher default-related and other loss mitigation servicing expenses and a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of
$2.6 billion
in 2011 compared to a
$2.0 billion
goodwill impairment charge in 2010. In 2011, we recorded
$1.8 billion
of mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs, which included
$1.3 billion
for compensatory fees as a result of elongated default timelines. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $1.1 billion in insurance expense due to the sale of Balboa and a decline of $667 million in production expense primarily due to lower origination volumes.
Compensatory fees are fees that we expect to be assessed by the government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) (collectively, the GSEs), as a result of foreclosure delays pursuant to first mortgage seller/servicer guides with the GSEs which provide timelines to complete the liquidation of delinquent loans. In instances where we fail to meet these timelines, our agreements provide the GSEs with the option to assess compensatory fees. The remainder of the mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs are out-of-pocket costs that we do not expect to recover. We expect these costs will remain elevated as additional loans are delayed in the foreclosure process. We also expect that continued elevated costs, including costs related to resources necessary to perform the foreclosure process assessments and to implement other operational changes, will continue.
Average economic capital decreased
30 percent
due to a reduction in credit risk driven by lower loan balances, and the sale of Balboa. Average allocated equity decreased for the same reasons as economic capital as well as the goodwill impairment charges in 2011 and 2010. For more information regarding economic capital and allocated equity, see
Supplemental Financial Data

.
Mortgage Banking Income
CRES
mortgage banking income is categorized into production and servicing income. Core production income is comprised of revenue from the fair value gains and losses recognized on our interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and LHFS, the related secondary market execution, and costs related to representations and warranties in the sales transactions along with other obligations incurred in the sales of mortgage loans. Ongoing costs related to representations and warranties and other obligations that were
 
incurred in the sales of mortgage loans in prior periods are also included in production income.
Servicing income includes income earned in connection with servicing activities and MSR valuation adjustments, net of economic hedge activities. The costs associated with our servicing activities are included in noninterest expense.
The table below summarizes the components of mortgage banking income.
Core production revenue of
$2.8 billion
in 2011
decreased
$3.4 billion
from 2010 due primarily to lower new loan origination volumes. The 52 percent decline in new loan originations was caused primarily by a drop in market share, as previously discussed, combined with the decline in the overall market demand for mortgages from 2010 to 2011. The representations and warranties provision
increased
$8.8 billion
to
$15.6 billion
in 2011 due to the BNY Mellon Settlement and other exposures.
Net servicing income
increased
$834 million
in 2011 due to a lower impact of customer payments partially offset by lower servicing fees driven by a decline in the servicing portfolio. Improved MSR results, net of hedges also contributed to the increase in net servicing income.
First mortgage production was
$151.8 billion
in
2011
compared to
$298.0 billion
in
2010
with the
decrease
primarily due to a reduction in both the correspondent and retail sales channels. Additionally, the overall industry market demand for mortgages dropped by approximately 17 percent in 2011, contributing to the decline in mortgage production. We expect our market share of mortgage originations in 2012 to be lower than
 
our market share in 2011, due to our exit from the correspondent channel.
Home equity production was
$4.4 billion
in
2011
compared to
$8.4 billion
in
2010
with the decrease primarily due to a decline in reverse mortgage originations based on our decision to exit this business in 2011.
At
December 31, 2011
, the consumer MSR balance was
$7.4 billion
, which represented
54
bps of the related unpaid principal balance compared to
$14.9 billion
or
92
bps of the related unpaid principal balance at
December 31, 2010
. The decline in the consumer MSR balance was primarily driven by lower mortgage rates, which resulted in higher forecasted prepayment speeds combined with the impact of elevated expected costs to service delinquent loans, which reduced expected cash flows and the value of the MSRs, and MSR sales. In addition, the MSRs declined as a result of customer payments. These declines were partially offset by adjustments to prepayment models to reflect muted refinancing activity relative to historic norms and by the addition of new MSRs recorded in connection with sales of loans. During
2011
, MSRs in the amount of
$896 million
were sold. Gains recognized on these transactions were not significant. These sales were undertaken to reduce the balance of MSRs, lower our default-related servicing costs and reduce risk in certain portfolios in preparation of the implementation of Basel III.

net income
increased
$1.2 billion
to

in
2011
from
2010
 primarily driven by a
decrease
in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by
lower
revenue.
Revenue
decreased
$430 million
primarily driven by
lower
net interest income related to ALM activities and lower accretion on acquired portfolios due to the impact of prepayments in prior periods, partially offset by the impact of
higher
average loan and deposit balances.
The provision for credit losses
decreased
$2.4 billion
to a benefit of
$1.1 billion
for
2011
compared to
2010
. The
decrease
was driven by the positive impact of the economic environment on the credit portfolio and an accelerated rate of loan resolutions in the commercial real estate portfolio.
Noninterest expense increased
$216 million
as higher FDIC expense was partially offset by lower personnel and occupancy expenses.
The return on average economic capital

increased
$211 million
in Global Corporate Banking and

$213 million
in
2011
as growth in loans was offset by a declining rate environment and lower accretion on acquired portfolios due to the impact of prepayments in prior periods. Business Lending revenues
declined
$554 million
in Global Commercial Banking primarily from lower net interest income from ALM activities and a
decline
in loan balances.
Average loan and lease balances in Global Corporate and Commercial Banking
increased
two percent
in
2011
as growth in Global Corporate Banking balances from increases in commercial and non-U.S. trade finance portfolios driven by continued international demand and improved domestic momentum was partially offset by declines in Global Commercial Banking due to a decrease in commercial real estate from pay downs. Global Corporate and Commercial Banking average deposits
increased
17 percent
in
2011
compared to
2010
as balances continued to grow due to clients' excess liquidity and limited alternative investment options.
Investment Banking
Client teams and product specialists underwrite and distribute debt, equity and other loan products, provide advisory services and tailored risk management solutions. The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between
Global Banking
and
Global Markets
based on the activities
 
performed by each segment. To provide a complete discussion of our consolidated investment banking income, the table below presents total Corporation investment banking income as well as the portion attributable to
Global Banking.
Total Corporation investment banking fees, excluding self-led deals,
decreased
$303 million
, or
five percent
, in
2011
compared to
2010
primarily driven by
lower
debt issuance fees due to challenging market conditions partially offset by
higher
advisory fees. Investment banking fees may continue to be adversely affected in 2012 by lower client activity and challenging market conditions as a result of, among other things, the European sovereign debt crisis and market volatility.
Global Markets
n/m = not meaningful
Global Markets
offers sales and trading services, including research, to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity and equity businesses.
Global Markets
product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets.
Global Markets
provides market-making, financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody services globally to our institutional investor clients in support of their investing and trading activities. We also work with our commercial and corporate clients to provide risk management products using interest rate, equity, credit, currency and commodity derivatives, foreign exchange, fixed-income and mortgage-related products. As a result of our market-making activities in these products, we may be required to manage risk in government securities, equity and equity-linked securities, high-grade and high-yield corporate debt securities, commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), commodities and asset-backed securities (ABS). In addition, the economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between
Global Markets
and
Global Banking
based on the activities performed by each segment.
Global Banking
originates certain deal-related transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are executed and distributed by
Global Markets.

for a discussion of investment banking fees on a consolidated basis.
Net income
decreased
$3.3 billion
to
$985 million
in
2011
 
compared to 2010
primarily driven by a
decline
of
$3.8 billion
in sales and trading revenue due to a challenging market environment, partially offset by net DVA gains. In
2011
, net DVA gains were
$1.0 billion
compared to
$262 million
in
2010
due to the widening of our credit spreads. Noninterest expense
increased
$467 million
driven primarily by higher costs related to investments in infrastructure.
Sales and trading revenue may continue to be adversely affected in 2012 by lower client activity and challenging market conditions as a result of, among other things, the European sovereign debt crisis, uncertainty regarding the outcome of the evolving domestic regulatory landscape, our credit ratings and market volatility.
Income tax expense included a $774 million charge to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax assets as a result of a reduction in the U.K. corporate income tax rate enacted during
2011
compared to a charge of $388 million for a rate reduction enacted in
2010
. For additional information related to the U.K. corporate income tax rate reduction, see
Financial Highlights  Income Tax Expense
on page
11
.
The return on average economic capital
decreased
due to lower net income partially offset by a
38 percent
decrease
in average economic capital due to lower counterparty credit risk and a decline in market risk-related trading exposures. Average allocated equity decreased for the same reasons as economic capital. For more
information regarding economic capital and allocated equity, see
Supplemental Financial Data
on page
15
.
Sales and trading revenue includes unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. The following table and related discussion present total sales and trading revenue, substantially all of which is in
Global Markets
with the remainder in
Global Banking
. Sales and trading revenue is segregated into fixed income (investment and non-investment grade corporate debt obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and CDOs), currencies (interest rate and foreign exchange contracts), commodities (primarily futures, forwards, swaps and options) and equity income from equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity.
Fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) revenue
decreased
$3.7 billion
, or
29 percent
, to
$8.9 billion
in
2011 compared to 2010
primarily due to lower client activity and continued adverse market conditions impacting our mortgage products, credit, and rates and currencies businesses, partially offset by net DVA gains. Excluding net DVA losses, FICC revenue
decreased
$4.3 billion
, or
35 percent
, to
$8.1 billion
primarily due to a deteriorating credit market environment. Equity income
decreased
$158 million
, or
four percent
, to
$3.9 billion
primarily due to lower equity derivative trading volumes. Sales and trading revenue included total commissions and brokerage fee revenue of
$2.2 billion
(
$2.1 billion
from equities and
$105 million
from FICC) in
2011
compared to
$2.3 billion
(
$2.2 billion
from equities and
$134 million
from FICC) in
2010
.
In conjunction with regulatory reform measures and our initiative to optimize our balance sheet, we exited our stand-alone proprietary trading business as of June 30, 2011, which involved trading activities in a variety of products, including stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities. Proprietary trading revenue was $434 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011 compared
 
to $1.4 billion for
2010
. For additional information on restrictions on proprietary trading, see
Regulatory Matters  Limitations on Proprietary Trading

Collateralized Debt Obligation and Monoline Exposure
CDO vehicles hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities and issue multiple tranches of debt securities including commercial paper, and mezzanine and equity securities. Our CDO-related exposure can be divided into funded and unfunded super senior liquidity commitment exposure and other super senior exposure, including cash positions and derivative contracts. For more information on our CDO positions, see
Note 8  Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
. Super senior exposure represents the most senior class of notes that are issued by the CDO vehicles and benefits from the subordination of all other securities issued by the CDO vehicles. In
2011
, we recorded losses of $86 million from our CDO-related exposure compared to losses of $573 million in
2010
.
At
December 31, 2011
, our super senior CDO exposure before consideration of insurance, net of write-downs, was
$376 million
, comprised solely of trading account assets, compared to
$2.0 billion
, comprised of
$1.3 billion
in trading account assets and
$675 million
in AFS debt securities at
December 31, 2010
. Of our super senior CDO exposure at
December 31, 2011
,
$224 million
was hedged and
$152 million
was unhedged compared to
$772 million
hedged and
$1.2 billion
unhedged at
December 31, 2010
. At
December 31, 2011
, there were no unrealized losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) on super senior cash positions and retained positions from liquidated CDOs compared to $466 million at
December 31, 2010
. The change was the result of sales of ABS CDOs.
With the Merrill Lynch acquisition, we acquired a loan that is collateralized by U.S. super senior ABS CDOs and recorded in
All Other.
For additional information, see
All Other

Excluding amounts related to transactions with a single counterparty, which were transferred to other assets as discussed below, the table below presents our original total notional, mark-to-market receivable and credit valuation adjustment for credit default swaps (CDS) and other positions with monolines.
Total monoline exposure, net of credit valuation adjustments,
decreased
$2.6 billion
to
$1.3 billion
at
December 31, 2011
driven by terminated monoline contracts and the reclassification of certain exposures. During
2011
, we terminated all of our monoline contracts referencing super senior ABS CDOs and reclassified net monoline exposure with a carrying value of
$1.3 billion
(
$4.7 billion
gross receivable less impairment) at
December 31, 2011
from derivative assets to other assets
 
because of the inherent default risk. Because these contracts no longer provide a hedge benefit, they are no longer considered derivative trading instruments. This exposure relates to a single counterparty and is recorded at fair value based on current net recovery projections. The net recovery projections take into account the present value of projected payments expected to be received from the counterparty.
Global Wealth & Investment Management
GWIM
consists of two primary businesses: Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) and U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management (U.S. Trust).
MLGWMs advisory business provides a high-touch client experience through a network of more than 17,000 financial advisors focused on clients with over $250,000 in total investable assets. MLGWM provides tailored solutions to meet our clients needs through a full set of brokerage, banking and retirement products in both domestic and international locations. MLGWM also includes our Retirement Services business, which previously had been classified as a separate business within
GWIM
.
U.S. Trust, together with MLGWMs Private Banking & Investments Group, provides comprehensive wealth management solutions targeted to wealthy and ultra-wealthy clients with investable assets of more than $5 million, as well as customized solutions to meet clients wealth structuring, investment management, trust and banking needs, including specialty asset management services.
Net income
increased
$319 million
, or
24 percent
, to
$1.7 billion
in
2011 compared to 2010
driven by higher net interest income, higher asset management fees and lower credit costs,
 
partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net interest income
increased
$370 million
, or
seven percent
, to
$6.1 billion
as the impact of higher average deposit balances more than offset the impact of a lower rate environment. Noninterest income
increased
$735 million
, or
seven percent
, to
$11.3 billion
primarily due to higher asset management fees driven by higher average market levels in
2011
compared to
2010
and continued long-term AUM flows. The provision for credit losses
decreased
$248 million
, or
38 percent
, to
$398 million
driven by improving portfolio trends. Noninterest expense
increased
$1.1 billion
, or
nine percent
, to
$14.4 billion
due to increased volume-driven expenses and personnel costs associated with continued investment in the business.
In
2011
, revenue from MLGWM was
$14.6 billion
,
up
eight percent from
2010
driven by an increase in asset management fees due to higher average market levels and long-term AUM flows, as well as higher net interest income. Revenue from U.S. Trust was
$2.7 billion
, which remained relatively unchanged from
2010
as an increase in asset management fees primarily from higher market levels was partially offset by lower net interest income.
GWIM
results are impacted by the migration of clients and their related deposit and loan balances to or from
CBB
,
CRES
and the ALM portfolio, as presented in the Migration Summary table. Migration in
2011
included the movement of balances to Merrill Edge, which is included in
CBB
. Subsequent to the date of the migration, the associated net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense are recorded in the business to which the clients migrated.
 
Client Balances
The table below presents client balances which consist of AUM, client brokerage assets, assets in custody, client deposits, and loans and leases.
The
decrease
in client balances was driven by lower broad based market levels at
December 31, 2011
compared to
December 31, 2010
partially offset by client inflows, particularly into long-term AUM.
All Other
n/m = not meaningful
All Other
consists of two broad groupings,
Equity Investments
and
Other
.
Equity Investments
includes GPI, Strategic and other investments, and Corporate Investments.
Other
includes liquidating businesses, merger and restructuring charges, ALM activities such as the residential mortgage portfolio and investment securities, and related activities including economic hedges and gains/losses on structured liabilities, the impact of certain allocation methodologies and accounting hedge ineffectiveness.
Other
also includes certain residential mortgage and discontinued real estate loans that are managed by Legacy Assets & Servicing within
CRES
. During
2011
, we sold our Canadian consumer card business and we are evaluating our remaining international consumer card operations. As a result of these actions, we reclassified results from these businesses, including prior periods, from
CBB
to
All Other
. For additional information on the other activities included in
All Other
, see
Note 26  Business Segment Information
to the Consolidated Financial
 
Statements
.
All Other
reported
net income
of
$4.8 billion
in
2011
compared to
$1.3 billion
in
2010
with the increase primarily due to higher noninterest income and lower merger and restructuring charges. Noninterest income increased due to positive fair value adjustments related to our own credit on structured liabilities of
$3.3 billion
in
2011
compared to
$18 million
in
2010
. Equity investment income
increased
$2.5 billion
as a result of a
$6.5 billion
gain from the sale of CCB shares (we currently hold approximately one percent of the outstanding common shares) partially offset by
$1.1 billion
of impairment charges on our merchant services joint venture and a decrease of
$1.9 billion
in GPI income. A non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of
$581 million
was taken during the
fourth quarter of 2011
as a result of a change in the estimated value of the European consumer card business. The prior year included
$1.2 billion
of gains on the sales of certain strategic investments. The provision
for credit losses
decreased
$152 million
to
$6.2 billion
driven by lower balances due primarily to divestitures; improvements in delinquencies, collections and insolvencies in the non-U.S. credit card portfolio; and continued run-off in the legacy Merrill Lynch commercial portfolio. These increases were largely offset by reserve additions to the Countrywide PCI discontinued real estate and residential mortgage portfolios and higher credit costs related to the non-PCI residential mortgage portfolio due primarily to the continuing decline in home prices.
The income tax
benefit
was
$1.0 billion
compared to a
benefit
of
$4.0 billion
for
2010
. The factors affecting taxes in
All Other

With the Merrill Lynch acquisition, we acquired a loan that is collateralized by U.S. super senior ABS CDOs, with a current carrying value of $3.1 billion at
December 31, 2011
, down from $4.2 billion at
December 31, 2010
primarily due to paydowns. The loan is recorded in
All Other
and all scheduled payments on the loan have been received to date. The loan matures in September 2023. For more information on our CDO exposure, see

2010
, and also a reconciliation to the total consolidated equity investment income for
2011
and
2010
.
 
Equity investments included in
All Other
decreased
$27.3 billion
during
2011
consistent with our continued efforts to reduce non-core assets including reducing both higher risk-weighted assets and assets currently deducted, or expected to be deducted under Basel III, from regulatory capital. For more information, see

.
GPI is comprised of a diversified portfolio of investments in private equity, real estate and other alternative investments. These investments are made either directly in a company or held through a fund with related income recorded in equity investment income. GPI had unfunded equity commitments of $710 million and $1.4 billion at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
related to certain of these investments. The Corporation has actively reduced these commitments in a series of transactions involving its private equity fund investments.
Strategic and other investments included in
All Other
decreased
$21.2 billion
during
2011
. The decrease was primarily the result of the sale of CCB shares and all of our investment in BlackRock during
2011
. In connection with the sale of our investment in CCB, we recorded gains of
$6.5 billion
. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, we owned
2.0 billion
shares and
25.6 billion
shares representing approximately
one percent
and
10 percent
of CCB. Sales restrictions on the remaining
2.0 billion
CCB shares continue until August 2013 and accordingly these shares are carried at cost. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, the cost basis of our total investment in CCB was
$716 million
and
$9.2 billion
, the carrying value was
$716 million
and
$19.7 billion
, and the fair value was
$1.4 billion
and
$20.8 billion
. During
2011
and
2010
, we recorded dividends of
$836 million
and
$535 million
from CCB. During
2011
, we sold our remaining ownership interest of approximately
13.6 million
preferred shares, or
seven percent
of BlackRock. In connection with the sale, we recorded a gain of
$377 million
. For more information, see
Note 5  Securities
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
During
2011
, we recorded
$1.1 billion
of impairment charges on our merchant services joint venture. The joint venture had a carrying value of
$3.4 billion
and
$4.7 billion
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
with the reduction in carrying value primarily the result of the impairment charges. The impairment charges were based on the ongoing financial performance of the joint venture and updated forecasts of its long-term financial performance. Because of the recent transfer of the joint venture investment from
Global Banking
to
CBB
, the impairment charges were recorded in
All Other
. For additional information, see
Note 5  Securities
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations
We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. Obligations that are legally binding agreements whereby we agree to purchase products or services with a specific minimum quantity defined at a fixed, minimum or variable price over a specified period of time are defined as purchase obligations. Included in purchase obligations are commitments to purchase loans of
$2.5 billion
and vendor contracts of
$15.7 billion
. The most significant vendor contracts include communication services, processing services and software contracts. Other long-term liabilities include our contractual funding obligations related to the Qualified Pension Plans, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans (the Plans). Obligations to the Plans are based on the current and projected
 
obligations of the Plans, performance of the Plans assets and any participant contributions, if applicable. During
2011
and
2010
, we contributed
$287 million
and
$395 million
to the Plans, and we expect to make at least
$337 million
of contributions during
2012
.
Debt, lease, equity and other obligations are more fully discussed in
Note 13  Long-term Debt
and
Note 14  Commitments and Contingencies

. The Plans are more fully discussed in
Note 19  Employee Benefit Plans

We enter into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of our customers. For a summary of the total unfunded, or off-balance sheet, credit extension commitment amounts by expiration date, see the table in
Note 14  Commitments and Contingencies
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
Table 10
presents total long-term debt and other obligations at
December 31, 2011
.
Representations and Warranties
We securitize first-lien residential mortgage loans generally in the form of MBS guaranteed by the GSEs or by Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) in the case of the FHA-insured, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed and Rural Housing Service-guaranteed mortgage loans. In addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations (in certain of these securitizations, monolines or financial guarantee providers insured all or some of the securities), or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, we or our subsidiaries or legacy companies make or have made various representations and warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties may result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or provide other remedies to the GSEs, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) with respect to FHA-insured loans, VA, whole-loan buyers, securitization trusts, monoline insurers or other financial guarantors (collectively, repurchases). In such cases, we would be exposed to any credit loss on the repurchased mortgage loans after accounting for any mortgage insurance (MI) or mortgage guaranty payments that we may receive.
Subject to the requirements and limitations of the applicable sales and securitization agreements, these representations and warranties can be enforced by the GSEs, HUD, VA, the whole-loan buyer, the securitization trustee or others as governed by the applicable agreement or, in certain first-lien and home equity securitizations where monoline insurers or other financial
 
guarantee providers have insured all or some of the securities issued, by the monoline insurer or other financial guarantor. In the case of loans sold to parties other than the GSEs or GNMA, the contractual liability to repurchase typically arises only if there is a breach of the representations and warranties that materially and adversely affects the interest of the investor, or investors, in the loan, or of the monoline insurer or other financial guarantor (as applicable). Contracts with the GSEs do not contain equivalent language, while GNMA generally limits repurchases to loans that are not insured or guaranteed as required.

Representations and Warranties Bulk Settlement Actions
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010, we have settled, or entered into agreements to settle, certain bulk representations and warranties claims with a trustee for certain legacy Countrywide private-label securitization trusts (the BNY Mellon Settlement), a monoline insurer (the Assured Guaranty Settlement) and with each of the GSEs (the GSE Agreements). We have vigorously contested
any request for repurchase when we conclude that a valid basis for repurchase does not exist and will continue to do so in the future. However, in an effort to resolve these legacy mortgage-related issues, we have reached bulk settlements, or agreements for bulk settlements, including settlement amounts which have been material, with the above-referenced counterparties in lieu of a loan-by-loan review process. We may reach other settlements in the future if opportunities arise on terms we believe to be advantageous. For a summary of the larger bulk settlement actions we have taken beginning in 2010 and the related impact on the representations and warranties provision and liability, see
Note 9  Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
. As indicated in
Note 9  Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees
and
Note 14  Commitments and Contingencies
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
, these bulk settlements generally do not cover all transactions with the relevant counterparties or all potential claims that may arise, including in some instances securities law, fraud and servicing claims, and our liability in connection with the transactions and claims not covered by these settlements could be material.
Recent Developments Related to the BNY Mellon Settlement
Under an order entered by the court in connection with the BNY Mellon Settlement, potentially interested persons had the opportunity to give notice of intent to object to the settlement (including on the basis that more information was needed) until August 30, 2011. Approximately
44
groups or entities appeared prior to the deadline;
two
of those groups or entities have subsequently withdrawn from the proceeding and one motion to intervene was denied. Certain of these groups or entities filed notices of intent to object, made motions to intervene, or both filed notices of intent to object and made motions to intervene. The parties filing motions to intervene include the Attorneys General of the states of New York and Delaware, whose motions to intervene were granted. Parties who filed notices stating that they wished to obtain more information about the settlement include the FDIC and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. We are not a party to the proceeding.
Certain of the motions to intervene and/or notices of intent to object allege various purported bases for opposition to the settlement, including challenges to the nature of the court proceeding and the lack of an opt-out mechanism, alleged conflicts of interest on the part of the institutional investor group and/or the Trustee, the inadequacy of the settlement amount and the method of allocating the settlement amount among the Covered Trusts, while other motions do not make substantive objections but state that they need more information about the settlement. An investor opposed to the settlement removed the proceeding to federal court. On
October 19, 2011
, the federal court denied BNY Mellons motion to remand the proceeding to state court. BNY Mellon, as well as the investors that have intervened in support of the BNY Mellon Settlement, petitioned to appeal the denial of this motion. On November 4, 2011, the district court entered a written order setting a discovery schedule, and discovery is ongoing. On
December 27, 2011
, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit accepted the appeal, and stated in an amended scheduling order that, pursuant to statute, it would rule on the appeal by
February 27, 2012
.
It is not currently possible to predict how many of the parties who have appeared in the court proceeding will ultimately object
 
to the BNY Mellon Settlement, whether the objections will prevent receipt of final court approval or the ultimate outcome of the court approval process, which can include appeals and could take a substantial period of time. In particular, conduct of discovery and the resolution of the objections to the settlement and any appeals could take a substantial period of time and these factors could materially delay the timing of final court approval. Accordingly, it is not possible to predict when the court approval process will be completed.
If final court approval is not obtained by
December 31, 2015
, we and legacy Countrywide may withdraw from the BNY Mellon Settlement, if the Trustee consents. The BNY Mellon Settlement also provides that if Covered Trusts representing unpaid principal balance exceeding a specified amount are excluded from the final BNY Mellon Settlement, based on investor objections or otherwise, we and legacy Countrywide have the option to withdraw from the BNY Mellon Settlement pursuant to the terms of the BNY Mellon Settlement agreement.
There can be no assurance that final court approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement will be obtained, that all conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement will be satisfied or, if certain conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement permitting withdrawal are met, that we and legacy Countrywide will not determine to withdraw from the settlement. If final court approval is not obtained or if we and legacy Countrywide determine to withdraw from the BNY Mellon Settlement in accordance with its terms, our future representations and warranties losses could be substantially different than existing accruals and the estimated range of possible loss over existing accruals described under
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  Experience with Investors Other than Government-sponsored Enterprises

Unresolved Claims Status
At
December 31, 2011
, our total unresolved repurchase claims were approximately
$14.3 billion
compared to
$10.7 billion
at
December 31, 2010
. These repurchase claims include
$1.7 billion
in demands from investors in the Covered Trusts received in 2010 but otherwise do not include any repurchase claims related to the Covered Trusts. During
2011
, we received
$17.5 billion
in new repurchase claims, including
$14.3 billion
in new repurchase claims submitted by the GSEs for both legacy Countrywide originations not covered by the GSE Agreements and legacy Bank of America originations, and
$3.2 billion
in repurchase claims related to non-GSE transactions. During 2011,
$14.1 billion
in claims were resolved primarily with the GSEs and through the Assured Guaranty Settlement. Of the claims resolved,
$7.5 billion
were resolved through rescissions and
$6.6 billion
were resolved through mortgage repurchase and make-whole payments. The GSEs repurchase requests, standards for rescission of repurchase requests and resolution processes have become increasingly inconsistent with the GSEs own past conduct and our interpretation of contractual liabilities. These developments have resulted in an increase in claims outstanding from the GSEs. Claims outstanding from the monolines declined as a result of the Assured Guaranty Settlement, and new claims from other monolines declined significantly during 2011, which we believe was due in part to the monolines focusing recent efforts towards litigation. Outstanding claims from whole loan, private-label securitization and other investors increased during 2011 primarily
as a result of the increase in repurchase claims received from trustees in non-GSE transactions. Generally the volume of unresolved repurchase claims from the FHA and VA for loans in GNMA-guaranteed securities is not significant because the requests are limited in number and are typically resolved quickly. For additional information concerning FHA-insured loans, see

.
In addition to repurchase claims, we receive notices from mortgage insurance companies of claim denials, cancellations or coverage rescission (collectively, MI rescission notices) and the amount of such notices have remained elevated. When there is disagreement with the mortgage insurer as to the resolution of a MI rescission notice, meaningful dialogue and negotiation are generally necessary between the parties to reach a conclusion on an individual notice. The level of engagement of the mortgage insurance companies varies and on-going litigation involving some of the mortgage insurance companies over individual and bulk rescissions or claims for rescission limits our ability to engage in constructive dialogue leading to resolution.
For loans sold to GSEs or private-label securitization trusts (including those wrapped by the monoline bond insurers), a MI rescission may give rise to a claim for breach of the applicable representations and warranties, depending on the governing sale contracts. In those cases where the governing contracts contain a MI-related representation and warranty which upon rescission requires us to repurchase the affected loan or indemnify the investor for the related loss, we realize the loss without the benefit of MI. If we are required to repurchase a loan or indemnify the investor as a result of a different breach of representations and warranties and there has been a MI rescission, or if we hold the loan for investment, we realize the loss without the benefit of MI. In addition, mortgage insurance companies have in some cases asserted the ability to curtail MI payments, which in these cases would reduce the MI proceeds available to reduce such loss on the loan. While a legitimate MI rescission may constitute a valid basis for repurchase or other remedies under the GSE agreements and a small number of private-label MBS securitizations, and a MI rescission notice may result in a repurchase request, we believe MI rescission notices in and of themselves are not valid repurchase requests.
At
December 31, 2011
, we had approximately
90,000
open MI rescission notices compared to
72,000
at
December 31, 2010
. Through
December 31, 2011
,
26 percent
of the MI rescission notices received have been resolved. Of those resolved,
24 percent
were resolved through our acceptance of the MI rescission,
46 percent
were resolved through reinstatement of coverage or payment of the claim by the mortgage insurance company, and
30 percent
were resolved on an aggregate basis through settlement, policy commutation or similar arrangement. As of
December 31, 2011
,
74 percent
of the MI rescission notices we have received have not yet been resolved. Of those not yet resolved,
48 percent
are implicated by ongoing litigation where no loan-level review is currently contemplated (nor required to preserve our legal rights). In this litigation, the litigating mortgage insurance companies are also seeking bulk rescission of certain policies, separate and apart from loan-by-loan denials or rescissions. We are in the process of reviewing
11 percent
of the remaining open MI rescission notices, and we have reviewed and are contesting the MI rescission with respect to
89 percent
of these remaining open MI rescission notices. Of the remaining open MI rescission notices,
29 percent
are also the subject of ongoing litigation although, at present,
 
these MI rescissions are being processed in a manner generally consistent with those not affected by litigation.
Representations and Warranties Liability
The liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related provision is included in mortgage banking income (loss). The methodology used to estimate the liability for representations and warranties is a function of the representations and warranties given and considers a variety of factors, which include depending on the counterparty, actual defaults, estimated future defaults, historical loss experience, estimated home prices, other economic conditions, estimated probability that a repurchase claim will be received, consideration of whether presentation thresholds will be met, number of payments made by the borrower prior to default and estimated probability that a loan will be required to be repurchased as well as other relevant facts and circumstances, such as bulk settlements and identity of the counterparty or type of counterparty, as we believe appropriate. In the case of private-label securitizations, our estimate considers implied repurchase experience based on the BNY Mellon Settlement, adjusted to reflect differences between the Covered Trusts and the remainder of the population of private-label securitizations, and assumes that the conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement will be met. The estimate of the liability for representations and warranties is based on currently available information, significant judgment and a number of factors, including those set forth above, that are subject to change.
At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, the liability was
$15.9 billion
and
$5.4 billion
. For
2011
, the provision for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees was
$15.6 billion
compared to
$6.8 billion
in
2010
. Of the
$15.6 billion
provision recorded in
2011
,
$8.6 billion
was attributable to the BNY Mellon Settlement and
$7.0 billion
was related to other exposures. The BNY Mellon Settlement led to the determination that we had sufficient experience to record a liability related to our exposure on certain other private-label securitizations. This determination combined with higher estimated GSE repurchase rates were the primary drivers of the balance of the provision in
2011
. GSE repurchase rates increased driven by higher than expected claims during
2011
, including claims on loans that defaulted more than
18
months prior to the repurchase request and on loans where the borrower has made a significant number of payments (e.g., at least
25
payments), in each case in numbers that were not expected based on historical claims. Changes to any one of these factors could significantly impact the estimate of the liability and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations for any particular period.
Estimated Range of Possible Loss
Government-sponsored Enterprises
Our estimated liability as of
December 31, 2011
for obligations under representations and warranties with respect to GSE exposures is necessarily dependent on, and limited by, our historical claims experience with the GSEs. It includes our understanding of our agreements with the GSEs and projections of future defaults as well as certain other assumptions, and judgmental factors. Accordingly, future provisions associated with obligations under representations and warranties made to the GSEs may be materially impacted if actual experiences are
different from our assumptions. The GSEs repurchase requests, standards for rescission of repurchase requests, and resolution processes have become increasingly inconsistent with the GSEs own past conduct and the Corporations interpretation of its contractual obligations. These developments have resulted in an increase in claims outstanding from the GSEs. We intend to repurchase loans to the extent required under the contracts and standards that govern our relationships with the GSEs. While we are seeking to resolve our differences with the GSEs concerning each partys interpretation of the requirements of the governing contracts, whether we will be able to achieve a resolution of these differences on acceptable terms, and timing thereof, is subject to significant uncertainty.
We are not able to predict changes in the behavior of the GSEs based on our past experiences. Therefore, it is not possible to reasonably estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss with respect to any such potential impact in excess of current accrued liabilities. See
Complex Accounting Estimates  Representations and Warranties
on page
102
for information related to the sensitivity of the assumptions used to estimate our liability for obligations under representations and warranties.
Non-Government-sponsored Enterprises
The population of private-label securitizations included in the BNY Mellon Settlement encompasses almost all legacy Countrywide first-lien private-label securitizations including loans originated principally in the
2004
through
2008
vintages. For the remainder of the population of private-label securitizations, we believe it is probable that other claimants in certain types of securitizations may come forward with claims that meet the requirements of the terms of the securitizations. We have seen an increased trend in requests for loan files from private-label securitization trustees and an increase in repurchase claims from private-label securitization trustees that meet the required standards. We believe that the provisions recorded in connection with the BNY Mellon Settlement and the additional non-GSE representations and warranties provisions recorded in
2011
have provided for a substantial portion of our non-GSE representations and warranties exposure. However, it is reasonably possible that future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the amounts recorded for these exposures. In addition, we have not recorded any representations and warranties liability for certain potential monoline exposures and certain potential whole loan and other private-label securitization exposures. We currently estimate that the range of possible loss related to non-GSE representations and warranties exposure as of
December 31, 2011
could be up to
$5 billion
over existing accruals. The estimated range of possible loss for non-GSE representations and warranties does not represent a probable loss, and is based on currently available information, significant judgment, and a number of assumptions, including those set forth below, that are subject to change.
The methodology used to estimate the non-GSE representations and warranties liability and the corresponding range of possible loss considers a variety of factors including our experience related to actual defaults, projected future defaults, historical loss experience, estimated home prices and other economic conditions. Among the factors that impact the non-GSE representations and warranties liability and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss are: (1) contractual loss causation requirements, (2) the representations and warranties provided, and (3) the requirement to meet certain presentation thresholds. The first factor is based on our belief that a non-GSE
 
contractual liability to repurchase a loan generally arises only if the counterparties prove there is a breach of representations and warranties that materially and adversely affects the interest of the investor or all investors, or the monoline insurer (as applicable), in a securitization trust, and accordingly, we believe that the repurchase claimants must prove that the alleged representations and warranties breach was the cause of the loss. The second factor is related to the fact that non-GSE securitizations include different types of representations and warranties than those provided to the GSEs. We believe the non-GSE securitizations representations and warranties are less rigorous and actionable than the explicit provisions of the comparable agreements with the GSEs without regard to any variations that may have arisen as a result of dealings with the GSEs. The third factor is related to the fact that certain presentation thresholds need to be met in order for any repurchase claim to be asserted on the initiative of investors under the non-GSE agreements. A securitization trustee may investigate or demand repurchase on its own action, and most agreements contain a threshold, for example
25
percent of the voting rights per trust, that allows investors to declare a servicing event of default under certain circumstances or to request certain action, such as requesting loan files, that the trustee may choose to accept and follow, exempt from liability, provided the trustee is acting in good faith. If there is an uncured servicing event of default, and the trustee fails to bring suit during a
60
-day period, then, under most agreements, investors may file suit. In addition to this, most agreements also allow investors to direct the securitization trustee to investigate loan files or demand the repurchase of loans, if security holders hold a specified percentage, for example
25
percent, of the voting rights of each tranche of the outstanding securities. Although we continue to believe that presentation thresholds are a factor in the determination of probable loss, given the BNY Mellon Settlement, the estimated range of possible loss assumes that the presentation threshold can be met for all of the non-GSE securitization transactions.
In addition, in the case of private-label securitizations, our estimate considers implied repurchase experience based on the BNY Mellon Settlement, adjusted to reflect differences between the Covered Trusts and the remainder of the population of private-label securitizations, and assumes that the conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement will be satisfied. For additional information about the methodology used to estimate the non-GSE representations and warranties liability and the corresponding range of possible loss, see
Note 9  Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
Future provisions and/or ranges of possible loss for non-GSE representations and warranties may be significantly impacted if actual experiences are different from our assumptions in our predictive models, including, without limitation, those regarding ultimate resolution of the BNY Mellon Settlement, estimated repurchase rates, economic conditions, estimated home prices, consumer and counterparty behavior, and a variety of other judgmental factors. Adverse developments with respect to one or more of the assumptions underlying the liability for representations and warranties and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss could result in significant increases to future provisions and this estimated range of possible loss. For example, if courts were to disagree with our interpretation that the underlying agreements require a claimant to prove that the representations and warranties breach was the cause of the loss, it could significantly impact this estimated range of possible loss. Additionally, if recent court
rulings related to monoline litigation, including one related to us, that have allowed sampling of loan files instead of requiring a loan-by-loan review to determine if a representations and warranties breach has occurred are followed generally by the courts, private-label securitization investors may view litigation as a more attractive alternative as compared to a loan-by-loan review. For additional information regarding these issues, see MBIA litigation in Litigation and Regulatory Matters in
Note 14  Commitments and Contingencies
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
. Finally, although we believe that the representations and warranties typically given in non-GSE transactions are less rigorous and actionable than those given in GSE transactions, we do not have significant loan-level experience in non-GSE transactions to measure the impact of these differences on the probability that a loan will be required to be repurchased.
The liability for obligations under representations and warranties with respect to GSE and non-GSE exposures and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss for non-GSE representations and warranties exposures do not include any losses related to litigation matters disclosed in
Note 14  Commitments and Contingencies
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
, nor do they include any separate foreclosure costs and related costs, assessments and compensatory fees or any possible losses related to potential claims for breaches of performance of servicing obligations (except as such losses are included as potential costs of the BNY Mellon Settlement), potential securities law or fraud claims or potential indemnity or other claims against us, including claims related to loans insured by the FHA. We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any possible loss with respect to any such servicing, securities law (except to the extent reflected in the aggregate range of possible loss for litigation and regulatory matters disclosed in
Note 14  Commitments and Contingencies
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
), fraud or other claims against us; however, such loss could be material.
 
Government-sponsored Enterprises Experience
Our current repurchase claims experience with the GSEs is predominantly concentrated in the
2004
through
2008
origination vintages where we believe that our exposure to representations and warranties liability is most significant. Our repurchase claims experience related to loans originated prior to
2004
has not been significant and we believe that the changes made to our operations and underwriting policies have reduced our exposure related to loans originated after
2008
.
Bank of America and legacy Countrywide sold approximately
$1.1 trillion
of loans originated from
2004
through
2008
to the GSEs. As of
December 31, 2011
,
11 percent
of the loans in these vintages have defaulted or are 180 days or more past due (severely delinquent). At least
25
payments have been made on approximately
65 percent
of severely delinquent or defaulted loans. Through
December 31, 2011
, we have received
$32.4 billion
in repurchase claims associated with these vintages, representing approximately
three percent
of the loans sold to the GSEs in these vintages. Including the agreement reached with FNMA on
December 31, 2010
, we have resolved
$25.7 billion
of these claims with a net loss experience of approximately
31 percent
. The claims resolved and the loss rate do not include
$839 million
in claims extinguished as a result of the agreement with FHLMC due to the global nature of the agreement and, specifically, the absence of a formal apportionment of the agreement amount between current and future claims. Our collateral loss severity rate on approved repurchases has averaged approximately
45 to 55
percent.
Table 11
highlights our experience with the GSEs related to loans originated from
2004
through
2008
. Outstanding GSE claims increased to $6.3 billion, primarily attributable to
$14.3 billion
in new repurchase claims submitted by the GSEs for both legacy Countrywide originations not covered by the GSE Agreements and legacy Bank of America originations. The high level of new claims was partially offset by the resolution of claims with the GSEs.
The GSEs repurchase requests, standards for rescission of repurchase requests and resolution processes have become increasingly inconsistent with their past conduct as well as our interpretation of our contractual obligations. Notably, in recent periods we have been experiencing elevated levels of new claims from the GSEs, including claims on loans on which borrowers have made a significant number of payments (e.g., at least
25
payments) or on loans which had defaulted more than 18 months prior to the repurchase request, in each case, in numbers that were not expected based on historical experience. Also, the criteria and the processes by which the GSEs are ultimately willing to resolve claims have changed in ways that are unfavorable to us. These developments have resulted in an increase in claims outstanding from the GSEs. We intend to repurchase loans to the extent required under the contracts and standards that govern our relationships with the GSEs. While we are seeking to resolve our differences with the GSEs concerning each partys interpretation of the requirements of the governing contracts, whether we will be able to achieve a resolution of these differences on acceptable terms and timing thereof, is subject to significant uncertainty.
Beginning in February 2012, we are no longer delivering purchase money and non-MHA refinance first-lien residential mortgage products into FNMA MBS pools because of the expiration and mutual non-renewal of certain contractual delivery commitments and variances that permit efficient delivery of such loans to FNMA. While we continue to have a valid agreement with FNMA permitting the delivery of purchase money and non-MHA refinance first-lien residential mortgage products without such contractual variances, the delivery of such products without contractual delivery commitments and variances would involve time and expense to implement the necessary operational and systems changes and otherwise present practical operational issues. The non-renewal of these variances was influenced, in part, by our ongoing differences with FNMA in other contexts, including repurchase claims. We do not expect this change to have a material impact on our
CRES
business, as we expect to rely on other sources of liquidity to actively extend mortgage credit to our customers including continuing to deliver such products into FHLMC MBS pools. Additionally, we continue to deliver MHA refinancing products into FNMA MBS pools and continue to engage in dialogue to attempt to address these differences.
On June 30, 2011, FNMA issued an announcement requiring servicers to report, effective
October 1, 2011
, all MI rescission notices with respect to loans sold to FNMA. The announcement also confirmed FNMAs view of its position that a mortgage insurance companys issuance of a MI rescission notice constitutes a breach of the lenders representations and warranties and permits FNMA to require the lender to repurchase the mortgage loan or promptly remit a make-whole payment covering FNMAs loss even if the lender is contesting the MI rescission notice. A related announcement included a ban on bulk settlements with mortgage insurers that provide for loss sharing in lieu of rescission. According to FNMAs announcement, through
June 30, 2012
, lenders have 90 days to appeal FNMAs repurchase request and 30 days (or such other time frame specified by FNMA) to appeal after that date. According to FNMAs announcement, in order to be successful in its appeal, a lender must provide documentation confirming reinstatement or continuation of coverage. This announcement could result in more repurchase requests from FNMA than the assumptions in our estimated liability contemplate. We also expect that in many cases (particularly in the context of individual or bulk rescissions being
 
contested through litigation), we will not be able to resolve MI rescission notices with the mortgage insurance companies before the expiration of the appeal period prescribed by the FNMA announcement. We have informed FNMA that we do not believe that the new policy is valid under our contracts with FNMA, and that we do not intend to repurchase loans under the terms set forth in the new policy. Our pipeline of outstanding repurchase claims from the GSEs resulting solely on MI rescission notices has increased during
2011
by
$935 million
to
$1.2 billion
at
December 31, 2011
. If we are required to abide by the terms of the new FNMA policy, our representations and warranties liability will likely increase.
Experience with Investors Other than Government-sponsored Enterprises
In prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries have sold pools of first-lien mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans. As detailed in
Table 12
, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold loans originated from
2004
through
2008
with an original principal balance of
$963 billion
to investors other than GSEs (although the GSEs are investors in certain private-label securitizations), of which approximately
$506 billion
in principal has been paid and
$239 billion
has defaulted or are severely delinquent at
December 31, 2011
.
As it relates to private-label securitizations, a contractual liability to repurchase mortgage loans generally arises only if counterparties prove there is a breach of the representations and warranties that materially and adversely affects the interest of the investor or all investors in a securitization trust or of the monoline insurer or other financial guarantor (as applicable). We believe that the longer a loan performs, the less likely it is that an alleged representations and warranties breach had a material impact on the loans performance or that a breach even exists. Because the majority of the borrowers in this population would have made a significant number of payments if they are not yet 180 days or more past due, we believe that the principal balance at the greatest risk for repurchase claims in this population of private-label securitization investors is a combination of loans that have already defaulted and those that are currently severely delinquent. Additionally, the obligation to repurchase loans also requires that counterparties have the contractual right to demand repurchase of the loans (presentation thresholds). While we believe the agreements for private-label securitizations generally contain less rigorous representations and warranties and place higher burdens on investors seeking repurchases than the explicit provisions of the comparable agreements with the GSEs without regard to any variations that may have arisen as a result of dealings with the GSEs, the agreements generally include a representation that underwriting practices were prudent and customary.
Any amounts paid related to repurchase claims from a monoline insurer are paid to the securitization trust and are applied in accordance with the terms of the governing securitization documents, which may include use by the securitization trust to repay any outstanding monoline advances or reduce future advances from the monolines. To the extent that a monoline has not advanced funds or does not anticipate that it will be required to advance funds to the securitization trust, the likelihood of receiving a repurchase claim from a monoline may be reduced as the monoline would receive limited or no benefit from the payment of repurchase claims. Moreover, some monolines are not currently
performing their obligations under the financial guaranty policies they issued which may, in certain circumstances, impact their ability to present repurchase claims, although in those circumstances, investors may be able to bring claims if contractual thresholds are met.
Table 12
details the population of loans originated between
2004
and
2008
and the population of loans sold as whole loans or in non-agency securitizations by entity and product together with the defaulted and severely delinquent loans stratified by the number of payments the borrower made prior to default or becoming severely delinquent at
December 31, 2011
. As shown in
Table 12
, at least
25
payments have been made on
 
approximately
63 percent
of the defaulted and severely delinquent loans. We believe many of the defaults observed in these securitizations have been, and continue to be, driven by external factors like the substantial depreciation in home prices, persistently high unemployment and other negative economic trends, diminishing the likelihood that any loan defect (assuming one exists at all) was the cause of a loans default. As of
December 31, 2011
, approximately
25 percent
of the loans sold to non-GSEs that were originated between
2004
and
2008
have defaulted or are severely delinquent. Of the original principal balance for Countrywide,
$409 billion
is included in the BNY Mellon Settlement.
Monoline Insurers
Legacy companies sold
$184.5 billion
of loans originated between
2004
and
2008
into monoline-insured securitizations, which are included in
Table 12
, including
$103.9 billion
of first-lien mortgages and
$80.6 billion
of home equity mortgages. Of these balances,
$45.9 billion
of the first-lien mortgages and
$50.4 billion
of the home equity mortgages have been paid in full and
$36.3 billion
of the first-lien mortgages and
$16.7 billion
of the home equity mortgages have defaulted or are severely delinquent at
December 31, 2011
. At least
25
payments have been made on approximately
60 percent
of the defaulted and severely delinquent loans. Of the first-lien mortgages sold,
$39.1 billion
, or
38 percent
, were sold as whole loans to other institutions which subsequently included these loans with those of other originators in private-label securitization transactions in which the monolines typically insured one or more securities. Through
December 31, 2011
, we have received
$6.0 billion
of representations and warranties claims related to the monoline-insured transactions. Of these repurchase claims,
$2.0 billion
were resolved through the Assured Guaranty Settlement,
$813 million
were resolved through repurchase or indemnification with losses of
$703 million
and
$138 million
were rescinded by the investor or paid in full. The majority of these resolved claims related to home equity mortgages. Experience with most of the monoline insurers has varied in terms of process, and experience with these counterparties has not been predictable.
 
At
December 31, 2011
, for loans originated between
2004
and
2008
, the unpaid principal balance of loans related to unresolved monoline repurchase claims was
$3.1 billion
, substantially all of which we have reviewed and declined to repurchase based on an assessment of whether a material breach exists. At
December 31, 2011
, the unpaid principal balance of loans in these vintages for which the monolines had requested loan files for review but for which no repurchase claim had been received was
$6.1 billion
, excluding loans that had been paid in full and file requests for loans included in the trusts settled with Assured Guaranty. There will likely be additional requests for loan files in the future leading to repurchase claims.
We have had limited experience with the monoline insurers, other than Assured Guaranty, in the repurchase process as each of these monoline insurers has instituted litigation against legacy Countrywide and/or Bank of America, which limits our ability to enter into constructive dialogue with these monolines to resolve the open claims. It is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate probable future repurchase obligations with respect to those monolines with whom we have limited repurchase experience and, therefore, no representations and warranties liability has been recorded in connection with these monolines, other than a liability for repurchase claims where we have determined that there are valid loan defects. Our estimated range
of possible loss related to non-GSE representations and warranties exposure as of
December 31, 2011
included possible losses related to these monoline insurers.
Whole Loans and Private-label Securitizations
Legacy entities, and to a lesser extent Bank of America, sold loans to investors as whole loans or via private-label securitizations. The majority of the loans sold were included in private-label securitizations, including third-party sponsored transactions. The loans sold with total principal balance of
$778.2 billion
, included in
Table 12
, were originated between
2004
and
2008
, of which
$409.4 billion
have been paid in full and
$186.1 billion
are defaulted or severely delinquent at
December 31, 2011
. In connection with these transactions, we provided representations and warranties, and the whole-loan investors may retain those rights even when the whole loans were aggregated with other collateral into private-label securitizations sponsored by the whole-loan investors. At least
25
payments have been made on approximately
64 percent
of the defaulted and severely delinquent loans. We have received approximately
$10.9 billion
of representations and warranties claims from whole-loan investors and private-label securitization investors related to these vintages, including
$6.1 billion
from whole-loan investors,
$2.2 billion
from private-label securitization trustees,
$1.7 billion
in claims from private-label securitization investors in the Covered Trusts received in 2010, and
$819 million
from one private-label securitization counterparty which were submitted prior to 2008. In private-label securitizations, certain representation thresholds need to be met in order for any repurchase claim to be asserted by the investors. The majority of the claims that we have received outside of those from the GSEs and monolines are from third-party whole-loan investors. However, the amount of claims received from private-label securitization trustees that meet the required standards has been increasing. In
2011
, we received
$2.1 billion
of repurchase claims from private-label securitization trustees. In addition, there has been an increase in requests for loan files from private-label securitization trustees, as well as requests for tolling agreements to toll the applicable statutes of limitation relating to representations and warranties claims, and we believe it is likely that these requests will lead to an increase in repurchase claims from private-label securitization trustees that meet the required standards.
We have resolved
$6.1 billion
of the claims received from whole-loan investors and private-label securitization investors with losses of
$1.4 billion
. Approximately
$2.8 billion
of these claims were resolved through repurchase or indemnification and
$3.3 billion
were rescinded by the investor. Claims outstanding related to these vintages totaled
$4.8 billion
, including
$2.8 billion
that have been reviewed where it is believed a valid defect has not been identified which would constitute an actionable breach of representations and warranties and
$2.0 billion
that are in the process of review.
Certain whole-loan investors have engaged with us in a consistent repurchase process and we have used that experience to record a liability related to existing and future claims from such counterparties. The BNY Mellon Settlement led to the determination in the second quarter of 2011 that we had sufficient experience to record a liability related to our exposure on certain other private-label securitizations. However, the BNY Mellon Settlement did not provide sufficient experience related to certain private-label securitizations sponsored by third-party whole-loan investors. As it relates to certain private-label securitizations sponsored by third-party whole-loan investors and certain other
 
whole loan sales, it is not possible to determine whether a loss has occurred or is probable and, therefore, no representations and warranties liability has been recorded in connection with these transactions. Our estimated range of possible loss related to non-GSE representations and warranties exposure as of
December 31, 2011
included possible losses related to these whole loan sales and private-label securitizations sponsored by third-party whole-loan investors.
Private-label securitization investors generally do not have the contractual right to demand repurchase of loans directly or the right to access loan files. The inclusion of the
$1.7 billion
in outstanding claims does not mean that we believe these claims have satisfied the contractual thresholds required for these investors to direct the securitization trustee to take action or that these claims are otherwise procedurally or substantively valid. One of these claimants has filed litigation against us relating to certain of these claims; the claims in this litigation would be extinguished if there is final court approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement. Additionally, certain private-label securitizations are insured by the monoline insurers, which are not reflected in these amounts regarding whole loan sales and private-label securitizations.
Other Mortgage-related Matters
Servicing Matters and Foreclosure Processes
We service a large portion of the loans we or our subsidiaries have securitized and also service loans on behalf of third-party securitization vehicles and other investors. Servicing agreements with the GSEs generally provide the GSEs with broader rights relative to the servicer than are found in servicing agreements with private investors. For example, each GSE typically claims the right to demand that the servicer repurchase loans that breach the sellers representations and warranties made in connection with the initial sale of the loans even if the servicer was not the seller. The GSEs also claim that they have the contractual right to demand indemnification or loan repurchase for certain servicing breaches. In addition, the GSEs first mortgage seller/servicer guides provide for timelines to resolve delinquent loans through workout efforts or liquidation, if necessary, and purport to require the imposition of compensatory fees if those deadlines are not satisfied except for reasons beyond the control of the servicer, although we believe that the governing contracts, our course of dealing, and collective past practices and understandings should inform resolution of these matters. In addition, many non-agency RMBS and whole-loan servicing agreements require the servicer to indemnify the trustee or other investor for or against failures by the servicer to perform its servicing obligations or acts or omissions that involve willful malfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of, or reckless disregard of, the servicers duties. It is not possible to reasonably estimate our liability with respect to potential servicing-related claims. While we have recorded certain accruals for servicing-related claims, the amount of potential liability in excess of existing accruals could be material.
In October 2010, we voluntarily stopped taking residential mortgage foreclosure proceedings to judgment in states where foreclosure requires a court order following a legal proceeding (judicial states) and stopped foreclosure sales in all states in order to complete an assessment of related business processes. We have resumed foreclosure sales in nearly all non-judicial states. While we have resumed foreclosure proceedings in nearly all judicial states, our progress on foreclosure sales in judicial states has been much slower than in non-judicial states. The pace of
foreclosure sales in judicial states increased significantly by the fourth quarter of 2011. However, there continues to be a backlog of foreclosure inventory in judicial states. The implementation of changes in procedures and controls, including loss mitigation procedures related to our ability to recover on FHA-insurance related claims, and governmental, regulatory and judicial actions, may result in continuing delays in foreclosure proceedings and foreclosure sales, and create obstacles to the collection of certain fees and expenses, in both judicial and non-judicial foreclosures.
We entered into a consent order with the Federal Reserve and BANA entered into a consent order with the OCC on April 13, 2011. These consent orders require servicers to make several enhancements to their servicing operations, including implementation of a single point of contact model for borrowers throughout the loss mitigation and foreclosure processes, adoption of measures designed to ensure that foreclosure activity is halted once a borrower has been approved for a modification unless the borrower fails to make payments under the modified loan and implementation of enhanced controls over third-party vendors that provide default servicing support services. In addition, the OCC consent order required that we retain an independent consultant, approved by the OCC, to conduct a review of all foreclosure actions pending, or foreclosure sales that occurred, between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2010 and submit a plan to the OCC to remediate all financial injury to borrowers caused by any deficiencies identified through the review. The review is comprised of two parts: a sample file review conducted by the independent consultant, which began in October 2011, and file reviews by the independent consultant based upon requests for review from customers with in-scope foreclosures. We began outreach to those customers in November 2011, and additional outreach efforts are underway. Because the review process is available to a large number of potentially eligible borrowers and involves an examination of many details and documents, each review could take several months to complete. We cannot yet accurately determine how many borrowers will ultimately request a review, how many borrowers will meet the eligibility requirements or how much in compensation might ultimately be paid to eligible borrowers.
We continue to be subject to additional borrower and non-borrower litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny related to our past and current servicing and foreclosure activities, including those claims not covered by the Servicing Resolution Agreements, defined below. This scrutiny may extend beyond our pending foreclosure matters to issues arising out of alleged irregularities with respect to previously completed foreclosure activities. The current environment of heightened regulatory scrutiny may subject us to inquiries or investigations that could significantly adversely affect our reputation and result in material costs to us.
Servicing Resolution Agreements
On
February 9, 2012
, we reached agreements in principle (collectively, the Servicing Resolution Agreements) with (1) the DOJ, various federal regulatory agencies and
49
state attorneys general to resolve federal and state investigations into certain origination, servicing and foreclosure practices (the Global AIP), (2) the Federal Housing Administration (the FHA) to resolve certain claims relating to the origination of FHA-insured mortgage loans, primarily by Countrywide prior to and for a period following our acquisition of that lender (the FHA AIP) and (3) each of the Federal Reserve and the OCC regarding civil monetary penalties related
 
to conduct that was the subject of consent orders entered into with the banking regulators in April 2011 (the Consent Order AIPs). The Servicing Resolution Agreements are subject to ongoing discussions among the parties and completion and execution of definitive documentation, as well as required regulatory and court approvals. There can be no assurance as to when or whether binding settlement agreements will be reached, that they will be on terms consistent with the Servicing Resolution Agreements, or as to when or whether the necessary approvals will be obtained and the settlements will be finalized.
The Global AIP calls for the establishment of certain uniform servicing standards, upfront cash payments of approximately
$1.9 billion
to the state and federal governments and for borrower restitution, approximately
$7.6 billion
in borrower assistance in the form of, among other things, principal reduction, short sales, deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure, and approximately
$1.0 billion
in refinancing assistance. We could be required to make additional payments if we fail to meet our borrower assistance and refinancing assistance commitments over a three-year period. In addition, we could be required to pay an additional
$350 million
if we fail to meet certain first-lien principal reduction thresholds over a three-year period. We also entered into agreements with several states under which we committed to perform certain minimum levels of principal reduction and related activities within those states as part of the Global AIP, and under which we could be required to make additional payments if we fail to meet such minimum levels.
The FHA AIP provides for an upfront cash payment of
$500 million
and the FHA would release us from all claims arising from loans originated on or before April 30, 2009 that were submitted for FHA insurance claim payments prior to January 1, 2012, and from multiple damages and penalties for loans that were originated on or before April 30, 2009, but had not been submitted for FHA insurance claim payment. An additional
$500 million
would be payable if we fail to meet certain principal reduction thresholds over a three-year period.
Pursuant to an agreement in principle, the OCC agreed to hold in abeyance the imposition of a civil monetary penalty of
$164 million
. Pursuant to a separate agreement in principle, the Federal Reserve will assess a civil monetary penalty in the amount of
$176 million
against us. Satisfying our payment, borrower assistance and remediation obligations under the Global AIP will satisfy any civil monetary penalty obligations arising under these agreements in principle. If, however, we do not make certain required payments or undertake certain required actions under the Global AIP, the OCC will assess, and the Federal Reserve will require us to pay, the difference between the aggregate value of the payments and actions under these agreements in principle and the penalty amounts.
Under the terms of the Global AIP, the federal and participating state governments would release us from further liability for certain alleged residential mortgage origination, servicing and foreclosure deficiencies. In settling origination issues related to FHA guaranteed loans originated on or before April 30, 2009, the FHA would provide us and our affiliates a release for all claims with respect to such loans if an insurance claim had been submitted to the FHA prior to January 1, 2012 and a release of multiple damages and penalties (but not single damages) if no such claim had been submitted.
The financial impact of the Servicing Resolution Agreements is not expected to require any additional reserves over existing accruals as of December 31, 2011, based on our understanding of the terms of the Servicing Resolution Agreements. The
refinancing assistance commitment under the Servicing Resolution Agreements is expected to be recognized as lower interest income in future periods as qualified borrowers pay reduced interest rates on loans refinanced. Although we may incur additional operating costs (e.g., servicing costs) to implement parts of the Servicing Resolution Agreements in future periods, it is expected that those costs will not be material.
The Servicing Resolution Agreements do not cover claims arising out of securitization (including representations made to investors respecting MBS), criminal claims, private claims by borrowers, claims by certain states for injunctive relief or actual economic damages to borrowers related to the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS), and claims by the GSEs (including repurchase demands), among other items. Failure to finalize the documentation related to the Servicing Resolution Agreements, to obtain the required court and regulatory approvals, to meet our borrower and refinancing commitments or other adverse developments with respect to the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc.
Mortgage notes, assignments or other documents are often required to be maintained and are often necessary to enforce mortgage loans. There has been significant public commentary regarding the common industry practice of recording mortgages in the name of MERS, as nominee on behalf of the note holder, and whether securitization trusts own the loans purported to be conveyed to them and have valid liens securing those loans. We currently use the MERS system for a substantial portion of the residential mortgage loans that we originate, including loans that have been sold to investors or securitization trusts. A component of the OCC consent order requires significant changes in the manner in which we service loans identifying MERS as the mortgagee. Additionally, certain local and state governments have commenced legal actions against us, MERS, and other MERS members, questioning the validity of the MERS model. Other challenges have also been made to the process for transferring mortgage loans to securitization trusts, asserting that having a mortgagee of record that is different than the holder of the mortgage note could break the chain of title and cloud the ownership of the loan. In order to foreclose on a mortgage loan, in certain cases it may be necessary or prudent for an assignment of the mortgage to be made to the holder of the note, which in the case of a mortgage held in the name of MERS as nominee would need to be completed by a MERS signing officer. As such, our practice is to obtain assignments of mortgages from MERS prior to instituting foreclosure. If certain required documents are missing or defective, or if the use of MERS is found not to be valid, we could be obligated to cure certain defects or in some circumstances be subject to additional costs and expenses. Our use of MERS as nominee for the mortgage may also create reputational risks for us.
Impact of Foreclosure Delays
In
2011
, we incurred
$1.8 billion
of mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs which included
$1.3 billion
for compensatory fees that we expect to be claimed by the GSEs as a result of foreclosure delays with the remainder being out-of-pocket costs that we do not expect to recover because of foreclosure delays. We expect that mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs, compensatory fees assessed by the GSEs and other costs
 
associated with foreclosures will remain elevated as additional loans are delayed in the foreclosure process, although we believe that the governing contracts, our course of dealing, and collective past practices and understandings should inform resolution of these matters. We also expect additional costs related to resources necessary to perform the foreclosure process assessment and to implement other operational changes will continue. This will likely result in continued higher noninterest expense, including higher default servicing costs and legal expenses in
CRES
, and has impacted and may continue to impact the value of our MSRs related to these serviced loans. It is also possible that the delays in foreclosure sales may result in additional costs and expenses, including costs associated with the maintenance of properties or possible home price declines while foreclosures are delayed. In addition, required process changes, including those required under the consent orders with federal bank regulators, are likely to result in further increases in our default servicing costs over the longer term. Finally, the time to complete foreclosure sales may continue to be protracted, which may result in a greater number of nonperforming loans and increased servicing advances and may impact the collectability of such advances and the value of our MSR asset, MBS and real estate owned properties.
An increase in the time to complete foreclosure sales also may increase the number of severely delinquent loans in our mortgage servicing portfolio, result in increasing levels of consumer nonperforming loans and could have a dampening effect on net interest margin as nonperforming assets increase. Accordingly, delays in foreclosure sales, including any delays beyond those currently anticipated, our continued process enhancements, including those required under the OCC and Federal Reserve consent orders and any issues that may arise out of alleged irregularities in our foreclosure process could significantly increase the costs associated with our mortgage operations.
Mortgage-related Settlements  Servicing Matters
In connection with the BNY Mellon Settlement, BANA has agreed to implement certain servicing changes. The Trustee and BANA have agreed to clarify and conform certain servicing standards related to loss mitigation. In particular, the BNY Mellon Settlement would clarify that it is permissible to apply the same loss-mitigation strategies to the Covered Trusts as are applied to BANA affiliates held-for-investment (HFI) portfolios. This portion of the agreement was effective in the second quarter of 2011 and is not conditioned on final court approval.
BANA also agreed to transfer the servicing related to certain high-risk loans to qualified subservicers on a schedule that began with the signing of the BNY Mellon Settlement. This servicing transfer protocol will reduce the servicing fees payable to BANA in the future. Upon final court approval, failure to meet the established benchmarking standards for loans not in subservicing arrangements can trigger the payment of agreed-upon fees. Additionally, we and legacy Countrywide have agreed to work to resolve with the Trustee certain mortgage documentation issues related to the enforceability of mortgages in foreclosure and to reimburse the related Covered Trust for any loss if BANA is unable to foreclose on the mortgage and the Covered Trust is not made whole by a title policy because of these documentation issues. These agreements will terminate if final court approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement is not obtained, although we could still have exposure under the pooling and servicing agreements related to the mortgages in the Covered Trusts for these documentation
issues.
We estimate that the costs associated with additional servicing obligations under the BNY Mellon Settlement contributed
$400 million
to the 2011 valuation charge related to the MSR asset. The additional servicing actions are consistent with the consent orders with the OCC and the Federal Reserve.
In addition, in connection with the Servicing Resolution Agreements, BANA has agreed to implement certain additional servicing changes. The uniform servicing standards established under the Servicing Resolution Agreements are broadly consistent with the residential mortgage servicing practices imposed by the OCC consent order, however they are more prescriptive and cover a broader range of our residential mortgage servicing activities. These standards are intended to strengthen procedural safeguards and documentation requirements associated with foreclosure, bankruptcy, and loss mitigation activities, as well as addressing the imposition of fees and the integrity of documentation, with a goal of ensuring greater transparency for borrowers. These uniform servicing standards also obligate us to implement compliance processes reasonably designed to provide assurance of the achievement of these objectives. Compliance with the uniform servicing standards will be assessed by a monitor based on the measurement of outcomes with respect to these objectives. Implementation of these uniform servicing standards is expected to incrementally increase costs associated with the servicing process, but is not expected to result in material delays or dislocation in the performance of our mortgage servicing obligations, including the completion of foreclosures.
Regulatory Matters
See
Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K
and
Note 14  Commitments and Contingencies
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information regarding regulatory matters and risks.
Financial Reform Act
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Financial Reform Act), which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, enacts sweeping financial regulatory reform and has altered and will continue to alter the way in which we conduct certain businesses, increase our costs and reduce our revenues. Many aspects of the Financial Reform Act remain subject to final rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the precise impact on the Corporation, our customers or the financial services industry.
Debit Interchange Fees
On June 29, 2011, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule with respect to the Durbin Amendment effective on October 1, 2011 which, among other things, established a regulatory cap for many types of debit interchange transactions to equal no more than 21 cents plus five bps of the value of the transaction. The Federal Reserve also adopted a rule to allow a debit card issuer to recover one cent per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud-related requirements, with which we are currently in compliance. The Federal Reserve also approved rules governing routing and exclusivity, requiring issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product, which became effective April 1, 2012.

Limitations on Proprietary Trading
On October 11, 2011, the Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), representing four of the five regulatory agencies charged with promulgating regulations implementing limitations on proprietary trading as well as the sponsorship of or investment in hedge funds and private equity funds (the Volcker Rule) established by the Financial Reform Act, released for comment proposed implementing regulations. On January 11, 2012, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the fifth agency, released for comment its proposed regulations under the Volcker Rule. The proposed regulations include clarifications to the definition of proprietary trading and distinctions between permitted and prohibited activities. However, in light of the complexity of the proposed regulations and the large volume of comments received (the proposal requested comments on over 1,300 questions on 400 different topics), it is not possible to predict the content of the final regulations or when they will be issued.
The statutory provisions of the Volcker Rule will become effective on July 21, 2012, whether or not the final regulations are adopted, and it gives certain financial institutions two years from the effective date, with opportunities for additional extensions, to bring activities and investments into compliance. Although
Global Markets e
xited its stand-alone proprietary trading business as of June 30, 2011 in anticipation of the Volcker Rule and further to our initiative to optimize our balance sheet, the ultimate impact of the Volcker Rule on us remains uncertain. However, based upon the content of the proposed regulations, it is possible that the implementation of the Volcker Rule could limit or restrict our remaining trading activities. Implementation of the Volcker Rule could also limit or restrict our ability to sponsor and hold ownership interests in hedge funds, private equity funds and other subsidiary operations, increase our operational and compliance costs, reduce our trading revenues and adversely affect our results of operations.

Derivatives
The Financial Reform Act includes measures to broaden the scope of derivative instruments subject to regulation by requiring clearing and exchange trading of certain derivatives; imposing new capital, margin, reporting, registration and business conduct requirements for certain market participants; and imposing position limits on certain OTC derivatives. The Financial Reform Act required regulators to promulgate the rulemakings necessary to implement these regulations by July 16, 2011. However, the rulemaking process was not completed as of this date, and is not expected to conclude until well into 2012. Further, the regulators granted temporary relief from certain requirements that would have taken effect on July 16, 2011 absent any rulemaking. The SEC temporary relief is effective until final rules relevant to each requirement become effective. The CFTC temporary relief is effective until the earlier of July 16, 2012 or the date on which final rules relevant to each requirement become effective. The ultimate impact of these derivatives regulations and the time it will take to comply continues to remain uncertain. The final regulations will impose additional operational and compliance costs on us and may require us to restructure certain businesses, thereby negatively impacting our revenues and results of operations.
FDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments
In April 2011, a new regulation became effective that implements revisions to the assessment system mandated by the Financial Reform Act and increased our FDIC exposure. The regulation was reflected in the June 30, 2011 FDIC fund balance and in payments made beginning on September 30, 2011. Among other things, the regulation changed the assessment base for insured depository institutions from adjusted domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets during an assessment period, less average tangible equity capital during that assessment period. Additionally, the FDIC has broad discretionary authority to increase assessments on large and highly complex institutions on a case by case basis. Any future increases in required deposit insurance premiums or other bank industry fees could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
Recovery and Resolution Planning
On October 17, 2011, the Federal Reserve approved a rule that requires the Corporation and other bank holding companies with assets of $50 billion or more, as well as companies designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, to periodically report to the FDIC and the Federal Reserve their plans for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure.
On January 17, 2012, the FDIC approved a final rule requiring resolution plans for insured banks with total assets of $50 billion or more. If the FDIC and the Federal Reserve determine that a companys plan is not credible and the company fails to cure the deficiencies in a timely manner, then the FDIC and the Federal Reserve may jointly impose on the company, or any of its subsidiaries, more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations. The Corporations initial plan is required to be submitted on or before July 1, 2012, and updated annually. Similarly, in the U.K., the Financial Services Authority (FSA) has issued proposed rules requiring the submission of significant information about certain U.K. incorporated subsidiaries, including information on intra-group dependencies and legal entity separation, to allow the FSA to develop resolution plans. As a result of the FSA review, we could be required to take certain actions over the next several years which could impose operational costs and potentially result in the restructuring of certain business and subsidiaries.
Orderly Liquidation Authority
Under the Financial Reform Act, where a systemically important financial institution such as the Corporation is in default or danger of default, the FDIC may, in certain circumstances, be appointed receiver in order to conduct an orderly liquidation of such systemically important financial institution. In such a case, the FDIC could invoke a new form of resolution authority, called the orderly liquidation authority, instead of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, if the Secretary of the Treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk determinations. The orderly liquidation authority is modeled in part on the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, but also adopts certain concepts from the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
The orderly liquidation authority contains certain differences from the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Macroprudential systemic protection is the primary objective of the orderly liquidation authority, subject to minimum threshold protections for creditors. Accordingly, in certain circumstances under the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC could permit payment of obligations determined
 
to be systemically significant (e.g., short-term creditors or operating creditors) in lieu of the payment of other obligations (e.g., long-term creditors) without the need to obtain creditors consent or prior court review. Additionally, under the orderly liquidation authority, amounts owed to the U.S. government generally enjoy a statutory payment priority.
Credit Risk Retention
On March 29, 2011, federal regulators jointly issued a proposed rule regarding credit risk retention that would, among other things, require retention by sponsors of at least five percent of the credit risk of the assets underlying certain ABS and MBS securitizations and would limit the ability to transfer or hedge that credit risk. The proposed rule as currently written would likely have an adverse impact on our ability to engage in many types of the MBS and ABS securitizations conducted in
CRES
,
Global Markets
and other business segments, impose additional operational and compliance costs on us, and negatively influence the value, liquidity and transferability of ABS or MBS, loans and other assets. However, it remains unclear what requirements will be included in the final rule and what the ultimate impact of the final rule will be on our
CRES
,
Global Markets
and other business segments or on our results of operations.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
The Financial Reform Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to regulate the offering of consumer financial products or services under federal consumer financial laws. In addition, the CFPB was granted general authority to prevent covered persons or service providers from committing or engaging in unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices under federal law in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. Pursuant to the Financial Reform Act, on July 21, 2011, certain federal consumer financial protection statutes and related regulatory authority were transferred to the CFPB. Consequently, certain federal consumer financial laws to which the Corporation is subject, including, but not limited to, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Electronic Fund Transfers Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Truth in Lending and Truth in Savings Acts will be enforced by the CFPB, subject to certain statutory limitations. On January 4, 2012, the CFPBs first director was appointed, and accordingly, was vested with full authority to exercise all supervisory, enforcement and rulemaking authorities granted to the CFPB under the Financial Reform Act, including its supervisory powers over non-bank financial institutions such as pay-day lenders and other types of non-bank financial institutions.
Certain Other Provisions
The Financial Reform Act also expands the role of state regulators in enforcing consumer protection requirements over banks and disqualifies trust preferred securities and other hybrid capital securities from Tier 1 capital. Many of the provisions under the Financial Reform Act have begun to be phased in or will be phased in over the next several months or years and will be subject both to further rulemaking and the discretion of applicable regulatory bodies. For additional information regarding regulatory capital and other rules proposed by federal regulators, see
Capital Management  Regulatory Capital Changes

.
The Financial Reform Act will continue to have a significant and negative impact on our earnings through fee reductions, higher costs and new restrictions, as well as reductions to available capital. The Financial Reform Act may also continue to have a material adverse impact on the value of certain assets and liabilities held on our balance sheet. The ultimate impact of the Financial Reform Act on our businesses and results of operations will depend on regulatory interpretation and rulemaking, as well as the success of any of our actions to mitigate the negative earnings impact of certain provisions. For information on the impact of the Financial Reform Act on our credit ratings, see
Liquidity Risk

Transactions with Affiliates
The terms of certain of our OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements of the Corporation provide that upon the occurrence of certain specified events, such as a change in our credit ratings, Merrill Lynch and other non-bank affiliates may be required to provide additional collateral or to provide other remedies, or our counterparties may have the right to terminate or otherwise diminish our rights under these contracts or agreements. Following the recent downgrade of the credit ratings of the Corporation and other non-bank affiliates, we have engaged in discussions with certain derivative and other counterparties regarding their rights under these agreements. In response to counterparties inquiries and requests, we have discussed and in some cases substituted derivative contracts and other trading agreements, including naming BANA as the new counterparty. Our ability to substitute or make changes to these agreements to meet counterparties requests may be subject to certain limitations, including counterparty willingness, regulatory limitations on naming BANA as the new counterparty, and the type or amount of collateral required. It is possible that such limitations on our ability to substitute or make changes to these agreements, including naming BANA as the new counterparty, could adversely affect our results of operations.
Other Matters
The Corporation has established guidelines and policies for managing capital across its subsidiaries. The guidance for the Corporations subsidiaries with regulatory capital requirements, including branch operations of banking subsidiaries, requires each entity to maintain satisfactory capital levels. This includes setting internal capital targets for the U.S. bank subsidiaries to exceed well capitalized levels. The U.K. has adopted increased capital and liquidity requirements for local financial institutions, including regulated U.K. subsidiaries of non-U.K. bank holding companies and other financial institutions as well as branches of non-U.K. banks located in the U.K. In addition, the U.K. has proposed the creation and production of recovery and resolution plans, commonly referred to as living wills, by such entities. We are currently monitoring the impact of these initiatives.
Managing Risk
Overview
Risk is inherent in every material business activity that we undertake. Our business exposes us to strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risk. We must manage these risks to maximize our long-term results by ensuring
 
the integrity of our assets and the quality of our earnings.
Strategic risk is the risk that results from adverse business decisions, ineffective or inappropriate business plans, or failure to respond to changes in the competitive environment, business cycles, customer preferences, product obsolescence, regulatory environment, business strategy execution, and/or other inherent risks of the business including reputational risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from a borrowers or counterpartys inability to meet its obligations. Market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as interest rate movements. Liquidity risk is the inability to meet contractual and contingent financial obligations, on-or off-balance sheet, as they come due. Compliance risk is the risk that arises from the failure to adhere to laws, rules, regulations, or internal policies and procedures. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or external events. Reputational risk is the potential that negative publicity regarding an organizations conduct or business practices will adversely affect its profitability, operations or customer base, or result in costly litigation or require other measures. Reputational risk is evaluated along with all of the risk categories and throughout the risk management process, and as such is not discussed separately herein. The following sections,

Compliance Risk Management
and
Operational Risk Management
both on page

, address in more detail the specific procedures, measures and analyses of the major categories of risk that we manage.
In choosing when and how to take risks, we evaluate our capacity for risk and seek to protect our brand and reputation, our financial flexibility, the value of our assets and the strategic potential of the Corporation. We intend to maintain a strong and flexible financial position. We also intend to focus on maintaining our relevance and value to customers, employees and shareholders. As part of our efforts to achieve these objectives, we continue to build a comprehensive risk management culture and to implement governance and control measures to strengthen that culture.
We take a comprehensive approach to risk management. We have a defined risk framework and clearly articulated risk appetite which is approved annually by the Corporations Board of Directors (the Board). Risk management planning is integrated with strategic, financial and customer/client planning so that goals and responsibilities are aligned across the organization. Risk is managed in a systematic manner by focusing on the Corporation as a whole as well as managing risk across the enterprise and within individual business units, products, services and transactions, and across all geographic locations. We maintain a governance structure that delineates the responsibilities for risk management activities, as well as governance and oversight of those activities.
Executive management assesses, and the Board oversees, the risk-adjusted returns of each business segment. Management reviews and approves strategic and financial operating plans, and recommends to the Board for approval a financial plan annually. By allocating economic capital to and establishing a risk appetite for a business segment, we seek to effectively manage the ability to take on risk. Economic capital is assigned to each business segment using a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segments stand-alone credit, market, interest rate and operational
risk
components, and is used to measure risk-adjusted returns.
In addition to reputational considerations, businesses operate within their credit, market, compliance and operational risk standards and limits in order to adhere to the risk appetite. These limits are based on analyses of risk and reward in each business, and executive management is responsible for tracking and reporting performance measurements as well as any exceptions to guidelines or limits. The Board monitors financial performance, execution of the strategic and financial operating plans, compliance with the risk appetite and the adequacy of internal controls through its committees.
The Board has completed its review of the Risk Framework and the Risk Appetite Statement for the Corporation, and both the Risk Framework and Risk Appetite Statement were approved in January 2012. The Risk Framework defines the accountability of the Corporation and its employees and the Risk Appetite Statement defines the parameters under which we will take risk. Both documents are intended to enable us to maximize our long-term results and ensure the integrity of our assets and the quality of our earnings. The Risk Framework is designed to be used by our employees to understand risk management activities, including their individual roles and accountabilities. It also defines how risk management is integrated into our core business processes, and it defines the risk management governance structure, including managements involvement. The risk management responsibilities of the businesses, governance and control functions, and Corporate Audit are also clearly defined. The risk management process includes four critical elements: identify and measure risk, mitigate and control risk, monitor and test risk, and report and review risk, and is applied across all business activities to enable an integrated and comprehensive review of risk consistent with the Boards Risk Appetite Statement.
Risk Management Processes and Methods
To support our corporate goals and objectives, risk appetite, and business and risk strategies, we maintain a governance structure that delineates the responsibilities for risk management activities, as well as governance and oversight of those activities, by management and the Board. All employees have accountability for risk management. Each employees risk management responsibilities falls into one of three major categories: businesses, governance and control, and Corporate Audit.
Business managers and employees are accountable for identifying, managing and escalating attention to all risks in their business units, including existing and emerging risks. Business managers must ensure that their business activities are conducted within the risk appetite defined by management and approved by the Board. The limits and controls for each business must be consistent with the Risk Appetite Statement. Employees in client and customer facing businesses are responsible for day-to-day business activities, including developing and delivering profitable products and services, fulfilling customer requests and maintaining desirable customer relationships. These employees are accountable for conducting their daily work in accordance with policies and procedures. It is the responsibility of each employee to protect the Corporation and defend the interests of the shareholders.
Governance and control functions are comprised of Global Risk Management, Global Compliance, Legal and the enterprise control functions and are tasked with independently overseeing and managing risk activities. Global Compliance (which included
 
Regulatory Relations) and Legal report to the Chief Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Relations Executive. Enterprise control functions consist of the Chief Financial Officer Group, Global Technology and Operations, Global Human Resources, Global Marketing and Corporate Affairs.
Global Risk Management is led by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO). The CRO leads senior management in managing risk, is independent from the Corporations business and enterprise control functions, and maintains sufficient autonomy to develop and implement meaningful risk management measures. This position serves to protect the Corporation and its shareholders. The CRO reports to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and is the management team lead or a participant in Board-level risk governance committees. The CRO has the mandate to ensure that appropriate risk management practices are in place, and are effective and consistent with our overall business strategy and risk appetite. Global Risk Management is comprised of two types of risk teams, Enterprise risk teams and independent business risk teams, which report to the CRO and are independent from the business and enterprise control functions.
Enterprise risk teams are responsible for setting and establishing enterprise policies, programs and standards, assessing program adherence, providing enterprise-level risk oversight, and reporting and monitoring for systemic and emerging risk issues. In addition, the Enterprise Risk Teams are responsible for monitoring and ensuring that risk limits are reasonable and consistent with the risk appetite. These risk teams also carry out risk-based oversight of the enterprise control functions.
Independent business risk teams are responsible for establishing policies, limits, standards, controls, metrics and thresholds within the defined corporate standards for the businesses to which they are aligned. The independent business risk teams are also responsible for ensuring that risk limits and standards are reasonable and consistent with the risk appetite.
Enterprise control functions are independent of the businesses and have risk governance and control responsibilities for enterprise programs. In this role, they are responsible for setting policies, standards and limits; providing risk reporting; monitoring for systemic risk issues including existing and emerging; and implementing procedures and controls at the enterprise and business levels for their respective control functions.
The Corporate Audit function and the Corporate General Auditor maintain independence from the businesses and governance and control functions by reporting directly to the Audit Committee of the Board. Corporate Audit provides independent assessment and validation through testing of key processes and controls across the Corporation. Corporate Audit also provides an independent assessment of the Corporations management and internal control systems. Corporate Audit activities are designed to provide reasonable assurance that resources are adequately protected; significant financial, managerial and operating information is materially complete, accurate and reliable; and employees actions are in compliance with the Corporations policies, standards, procedures, and applicable laws and regulations.
To assist the Corporation in achieving its goals and objectives, risk appetite, and business and risk strategies, we utilize a risk management process that is applied across the execution of all business activities. This risk management process, which is an integral part of our Risk Framework, enables the Corporation to review risk in an integrated and comprehensive manner across all risk categories and make strategic and business decisions based on that comprehensive view. Corporate goals and objectives are
established by management, and management reflects these goals and objectives in our risk appetite which is approved by the Board and serves as a key driver for setting business and risk strategy.
One of the key tools of the risk management process is the use of Risk and Control Self-Assessments (RCSAs). RCSAs are the primary method for facilitating the management of Business Environment and Internal Control Factor data. The end-to-end RCSA process incorporates risk identification and assessment of the control environment; monitoring, reporting and escalating risk; quality assurance and data validation; and integration with the risk appetite. The RCSA process also incorporates documentation by either the business or governance and control functions of the business environment, risks, controls, and monitoring and reporting. This results in a comprehensive risk management view that enables understanding of and action on operational risks and controls for all of our processes, products, activities and systems.
The formal processes used to manage risk represent a part of our overall risk management process. Corporate culture and the actions of our employees are also critical to effective risk management. Through our Code of Ethics, we set a high standard for our employees. The Code of Ethics provides a framework for all of our employees to conduct themselves with the highest
 
integrity. We instill a strong and comprehensive risk management culture through communications, training, policies, procedures, and organizational roles and responsibilities. Additionally, we continue to strengthen the link between the employee performance management process and individual compensation to encourage employees to work toward enterprise-wide risk goals.
Board Oversight of Risk
The Board, comprised of a majority of independent directors, including an independent Chairman of the Board, oversees the management of the Corporation through a governance structure that includes Board committees and management committees. The Boards standing committees that oversee the management of the majority of the risks faced by the Corporation include the Audit and Enterprise Risk Committees, comprised of independent directors, and the Credit Committee, comprised of non-management directors. This governance structure is designed to align the interests of the Board and management with those of our stockholders and to foster integrity throughout the Corporation.
The chart below illustrates the inter-relationship between the Board, Board committees and management committees with the majority of risk oversight responsibilities for the Corporation.
Our Boards Audit, Credit and Enterprise Risk Committees have the principal responsibility for assisting the Board with enterprise-wide oversight of the Corporations management and handling of risk.
Our Audit Committee assists the Board in the oversight of, among other things, the integrity of our consolidated financial statements, our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and the overall effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Our Audit Committee also, taking into consideration the Boards allocation of the review of risk among various committees of the Board, discusses with management guidelines and policies to govern the process by which risk assessment and risk management are undertaken, including the assessment of our major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures.
Our Credit Committee oversees, among other things, the identification and management of our credit exposures on an enterprise-wide basis, our responses to trends affecting those exposures, the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and our credit related policies.
Our Enterprise Risk Committee, among other things, oversees our identification of, management of and planning for, material risks on an enterprise-wide basis, including market risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and reputational risk. Our Enterprise Risk Committee also oversees our capital management and liquidity planning.
Each of these committees regularly reports to our Board on risk-related matters within the committees responsibilities, which collectively provides our Board with integrated, thorough insight about our management of our enterprise-wide risks. At meetings of our Audit, Credit and Enterprise Risk Committees and our Board, directors receive updates from management regarding enterprise risk management, including our performance against our risk appetite.
Executive management develops for Board approval the Corporations Risk Framework, Risk Appetite Statement, and financial operating plans. Management monitors, and the Board oversees, through the Credit, Enterprise Risk and Audit Committees, financial performance, execution of the strategic and financial operating plans, compliance with the risk appetite, and the adequacy of internal controls.
Strategic Risk Management
Strategic risk is embedded in every business and is one of the major risk categories along with credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. It is the risk that results from adverse business decisions, ineffective or inappropriate business plans, or failure to respond to changes in the competitive environment, business cycles, customer preferences, product obsolescence, regulatory environment, business strategy execution and/or other inherent risks of the business including reputational and operational risk. In the financial services industry, strategic risk is elevated due to changing customer, competitive and regulatory environments. Our appetite for strategic risk is assessed within the context of the strategic plan, with strategic risks selectively and carefully considered in the context of the evolving marketplace. Strategic risk is managed in the context of our overall financial condition
 
and assessed, managed and acted on by the CEO and executive management team. Significant strategic actions, such as material acquisitions or capital actions, require review and approval of the Board.
Executive management approves a strategic plan every two to three years. Annually, executive management develops a financial operating plan that implements the strategic goals for that year, and the Board reviews and approves the plan. With oversight by the Board, executive management ensures that the plans are consistent with the Corporations strategic plan, core operating tenets and risk appetite. The following are assessed in their reviews: forecasted earnings and returns on capital, the current risk profile, current capital and liquidity requirements, staffing levels and changes required to support the plan, stress testing results, and other qualitative factors such as market growth rates and peer analysis. At the business level, as we introduce new products, we monitor their performance to evaluate expectations (e.g., for earnings and returns on capital). With oversight by the Board, executive management performs similar analyses throughout the year, and evaluates changes to the financial forecast or the risk, capital or liquidity positions as deemed appropriate to balance and optimize between achieving the targeted risk appetite, shareholder returns and maintaining the targeted financial strength.
We use proprietary models to measure the capital requirements for credit, country, market, operational and strategic risks. The economic capital assigned to each business is based on its unique risk exposures. With oversight by the Board, executive management assesses the risk-adjusted returns of each business in approving strategic and financial operating plans. The businesses use economic capital to define business strategies, price products and transactions, and evaluate client profitability. For additional information on how this measure is calculated, see

Capital Management
Bank of America manages its capital position to ensure capital is sufficient to support our business activities and that capital, risk and risk appetite are commensurate with one another, ensure safety and soundness under adverse scenarios, take advantage of growth and strategic opportunities, maintain ready access to financial markets, remain a source of strength for its subsidiaries and satisfy current and future regulatory capital requirements.
To determine the appropriate level of capital, we assess the results of our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), the current economic and market environment, and feedback from investors, rating agencies and regulators. Based upon this analysis we set capital guidelines for Tier 1 common capital and Tier 1 capital to ensure we can maintain an adequate capital position in a severe adverse economic scenario. We also target to maintain capital in excess of the capital required per our economic capital measurement process. For additional information, see
Economic Capital
on page
52
. Management and the Board annually approve a comprehensive Capital Plan which documents the ICAAP and related results, analysis and support for the capital guidelines, and planned capital actions and capital adequacy assessment.
The ICAAP incorporates capital forecasts, stress test results, economic capital, qualitative risk assessments and assessment of regulatory changes. We generate monthly regulatory capital and economic capital forecasts that are aligned to the most recent earnings, balance sheet and risk forecasts. We utilize quarterly stress tests to assess the potential impacts to our balance sheet, earnings, capital and liquidity for a variety of economic stress scenarios. We perform qualitative risk assessments to identify and assess material risks not fully captured in the forecasts, stress tests or economic capital. Given the significant proposed regulatory capital changes, we also regularly assess the potential capital impacts and monitor associated mitigation actions. Management continuously assesses ICAAP results and provides documented quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the capital guidelines and capital position to the Board or its committees.
Capital management is integrated into the risk and governance processes, as capital is a key consideration in the development of the strategic plan, risk appetite and risk limits. Economic capital is allocated to each business unit and used to perform risk-adjusted return analysis at the business unit, client relationship and transaction levels.
Regulatory Capital
As a financial services holding company, we are subject to the risk-based capital guidelines (Basel I) issued by federal banking regulators. At
December 31, 2011
, we operated banking activities primarily under two charters: BANA and FIA Card Services, N.A. (FIA). Under these guidelines, the Corporation and its affiliated banking entities measure capital adequacy based on Tier 1 common capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital). Capital ratios are calculated by dividing each capital amount by risk-weighted assets. Additionally, Tier 1 capital is divided by adjusted quarterly average total assets to derive the Tier 1 leverage ratio.
Tier 1 capital is calculated as the sum of core capital elements. The predominate components of core capital elements are qualifying common stockholders equity and qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Also included in Tier 1 capital are qualifying trust preferred securities (Trust Securities), hybrid securities and qualifying non-controlling interest in subsidiaries which are subject to the rules governing restricted core capital elements. Goodwill, other disallowed intangible assets, disallowed deferred tax assets and the cumulative changes in fair value of all financial liabilities accounted for under the fair value option that are included in retained earnings and are attributable to changes in the companys own creditworthiness are deducted from the sum of the core capital elements. Total capital is Tier 1 plus supplementary Tier 2 capital elements such as qualifying subordinated debt, a limited portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses, and a portion of net unrealized gains on AFS marketable equity securities. Tier 1 common capital is not
 
an official regulatory ratio, but was introduced by the Federal Reserve during the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program in 2009. Tier 1 common capital is Tier 1 capital less preferred stock, Trust Securities, hybrid securities and qualifying non-controlling interest in subsidiaries.
Risk-weighted assets are calculated for credit risk for all on- and off-balance sheet credit exposures and for market risk on trading assets and liabilities, including derivative exposures. Credit risk risk-weighted assets are calculated by assigning a prescribed risk-weight to all on-balance sheet assets and to the credit equivalent amount of certain off-balance sheet exposures. The risk-weight is defined in the regulatory rules based upon the obligor or guarantor type and collateral if applicable. Off-balance sheet exposures include financial guarantees, unfunded lending commitments, letters of credit and derivatives. Market risk risk-weighted assets are calculated using risk models for the trading account positions, including all foreign exchange and commodity positions regardless of the applicable accounting guidance. Under Basel I there are no risk-weighted assets calculated for operational risk. Any assets that are a direct deduction from the computation of capital are excluded from risk-weighted assets and adjusted average total assets consistent with regulatory guidance.
The Corporation has issued notes to certain unconsolidated corporate-sponsored trust companies which issued Trust Securities and hybrid securities. In accordance with Federal Reserve guidance, Trust Securities continue to qualify as Tier 1 capital with revised quantitative limits. As a result, the Corporation includes qualifying Trust Securities in Tier 1 capital. The Financial Reform Act includes a provision under which the Corporations outstanding Trust Securities in the aggregate amount of $16.1 billion (approximately 125 bps of Tier 1 capital) at
December 31, 2011
will be excluded from Tier 1 capital, with the exclusion to be phased in incrementally over a three-year period beginning January 1, 2013. This amount excludes $633 million of hybrid Trust Securities that are expected to be converted to preferred stock prior to the date of implementation. The treatment of Trust Securities during the phase-in period is unknown and is subject to future rulemaking.

Capital Composition and Ratios
Tier 1 common capital
increased
$1.6 billion
to
$126.7 billion
at
December 31, 2011
compared to
2010
. The increase was driven primarily by the sale of CCB shares, the exchanges of preferred shares, Trust Securities and hybrid securities for common stock and debt, and the warrants issued in connection with the investment made by Berkshire, partially offset by an increase in deferred tax assets disallowed for regulatory capital purposes. The sales related to CCB increased Tier 1 common capital $6.4
billion, or approximately 55 bps, while the exchanges increased Tier 1 common capital $3.9 billion, or approximately 29 bps. The warrants related to Berkshire, increased Tier 1 common capital approximately $2.1 billion, or 15 bps. The $8.1 billion increase in the deferred tax asset disallowance at
December 31, 2011
compared to
2010
was primarily due to the expiration of the longer look-forward period granted by regulators at the time of the Merrill Lynch acquisition and an increase in net deferred tax assets. Tier 1 capital and Total capital
decreased
$4.4 billion
and
$14.5 billion
at
December 31, 2011
compared to
2010
. For additional information regarding the sale of our investment in CCB, see

.
Risk-weighted assets
decreased
$172 billion
to
$1,284 billion
at
December 31, 2011
compared to
2010
. The decrease was driven in part by our sale of CCB shares and our Canadian card business and is consistent with our continued efforts to reduce non-core assets and legacy loan portfolios. The Tier 1 common capital ratio, the Tier 1 capital ratio and the Total capital ratio
increased
due to the decline in risk-weighted assets. The Tier 1
 
leverage ratio
increased
compared to
2010
reflecting the decrease in Tier 1 capital and a reduction in adjusted quarterly average total assets.

Regulatory Capital Changes
We manage regulatory capital to adhere to regulatory standards of capital adequacy based on our current understanding of the rules and the application of such rules to our business as currently conducted. The regulatory capital rules as written by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) continue to evolve.
We currently measure and report our capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel I. See
Capital Management
on page
48
for additional information. Basel I has been subject to revisions, which include final Basel II rules (Basel II) published in December 2007 by U.S banking regulators and proposed Basel
 
III rules (Basel III) published by the Basel Committee in December 2010, and further amended in July 2011. We are currently in the Basel II parallel period.
On December 29, 2011, U.S. regulators issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) that would amend a December 2010 NPR on the Market Risk Rules. This amended NPR is expected to increase the capital requirements for our trading assets and liabilities. We continue to evaluate the capital impact of the proposed rules and currently anticipate that we will be in compliance with any final rules by the projected implementation date in late 2012.
If implemented by U.S. banking regulators as proposed, Basel III could significantly increase our capital requirements. Basel III and the Financial Reform Act propose the disqualification of Trust Securities from Tier 1 capital, with the Financial Reform Act proposing that the disqualification be phased in from 2013 to 2015. Basel III also proposes the deduction of certain assets from capital (deferred tax assets, MSRs, investments in financial firms and pension assets, among others, within prescribed limitations), the inclusion of accumulated OCI in capital, increased capital for counterparty credit risk, and new minimum capital and buffer requirements. For additional information on deferred tax assets and MSRs, see
Note 21  Income Taxes
and
Note 25  Mortgage Servicing Rights
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
The phase-in period for the capital deductions is proposed to occur in 20 percent increments from 2014 through 2018 with full implementation by December 31, 2018. An increase in capital requirements for counterparty credit risk is proposed to be effective January 2013. The phase-in period for the new minimum capital requirements and related buffers is proposed to occur between 2013 and 2019. U.S. banking regulators have not yet issued proposed regulations that will implement these requirements.
Preparing for the implementation of the new capital rules is a top strategic priority, and we expect to comply with the final rules when issued and effective. We intend to continue to build capital through retaining earnings, actively reducing legacy asset portfolios and implementing other capital related initiatives, including focusing on reducing both higher risk-weighted assets and assets currently deducted, or expected to be deducted under Basel III, from capital. We expect non-core asset sales to play a less prominent role in our capital strategy in future periods.
On June 17, 2011, U.S. banking regulators proposed rules requiring all large bank holding companies (BHCs) to submit a comprehensive capital plan to the Federal Reserve as part of an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). The proposed regulations require BHCs to demonstrate adequate capital to support planned capital actions, such as dividends, share repurchases or other forms of distributing capital. CCAR submissions are subject to the review and approval of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve may require BHCs to provide prior notice under certain circumstances before making a capital distribution. On January 5, 2012, we submitted a capital plan to the Federal Reserve consistent with the proposed rules. The capital plan includes the ICAAP and related results, analysis and support for the capital guidelines, and planned capital actions. The ICAAP incorporates capital forecasts, stress test results, economic capital, qualitative risk assessments and assessment
 
of regulatory changes, all of which influence the capital adequacy assessment.
On July 19, 2011, the Basel Committee published the consultative document Globally systemic important banks: Assessment methodology and the additional loss absorbency requirement which sets out measures for global, systemically important financial institutions including the methodology for measuring systemic importance, the additional capital required (the SIFI buffer), and the arrangements by which they will be phased in. As proposed, the SIFI buffer would be met with additional Tier 1 common equity ranging from
one percent
to
2.5 percent
, and in certain circumstances,
3.5 percent
. This will be phased in from 2016 through 2018. U.S. banking regulators have not yet provided similar rules for U.S. implementation of a SIFI buffer.
Given that the U.S. regulatory agencies have issued neither proposed rulemaking nor supervisory guidance on Basel III, significant uncertainty exists regarding the eventual impacts of Basel III on U.S. financial institutions, including us. These regulatory changes also require approval by the U.S. regulatory agencies of analytical models used as part of our capital measurement and assessment, especially in the case of more complex models. If these more complex models are not approved, it could require financial institutions to hold additional capital, which in some cases could be significant.
Based on the assumed approval of these models and our current assessment of Basel III, continued focus on capital management, expectations of future performance and continued efforts to build a fortress balance sheet, we currently anticipate that our Tier 1 common equity ratio will be between 7.25 percent and 7.50 percent by the end of 2012, assuming phase-in per the regulations at that time of all deductions scheduled to occur between 2013 and 2019.
On December 20, 2011, the Federal Reserve issued proposed rules to implement enhanced supervisory and prudential requirements and the early remediation requirements established under the Financial Reform Act. The enhanced standards include risk-based capital and leverage requirements, liquidity standards, requirements for overall risk management, single-counterparty credit limits, stress test requirements and a debt-to-equity limit for certain companies determined to pose a threat to financial stability. Comments on the proposed rules are due by March 31, 2012. The final rules are likely to influence our regulatory capital and liquidity planning process, and may impose additional operational and compliance costs on us.

Broker/Dealer Regulatory Capital
The Corporations principal U.S. broker/dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith (MLPF&S) and Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp (MLPCC). MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of MLPF&S and provides clearing and settlement services. Both entities are subject to the net capital requirements of SEC Rule 15c3-1. Both entities are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to the CFTC Regulation 1.17.
MLPF&S has elected to compute the minimum capital requirement in accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirement as permitted by SEC Rule 15c3-1. At
December 31, 2011
, MLPF&Ss regulatory net capital as defined by Rule 15c3-1 was $10.8 billion and exceeded the minimum requirement of $803 million by $10.0 billion. MLPCCs net capital of $3.5 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $168 million by approximately $3.3 billion.
 
In accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirements, MLPF&S is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1 billion, net capital in excess of $500 million and notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $5 billion. At
December 31, 2011
, MLPF&S had tentative net capital and net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements.
Economic Capital
Our economic capital measurement process provides a risk-based measurement of the capital required for unexpected credit, market and operational losses over a one-year time horizon at a 99.97 percent confidence level. Economic capital is allocated to each business unit based upon its risk positions and contribution to enterprise risk, and is used for capital adequacy, performance measurement and risk management purposes. The strategic planning process utilizes economic capital with the goal of allocating risk appropriately and measuring returns consistently across all businesses and activities. Economic capital allocation plans are incorporated into the Corporations financial plan which is approved by the Board on an annual basis.
Credit Risk Capital
Economic capital for credit risk captures two types of risks: default risk, which represents the loss of principal due to outright default or the borrowers inability to repay an obligation in full, and migration risk, which represents potential loss in market value due to credit deterioration over the one-year capital time horizon. Credit risk is assessed and modeled for all on- and off-balance sheet credit exposures within sub-categories for commercial, retail, counterparty and investment securities. The economic capital methodology captures dimensions such as concentration and country risk and originated securitizations. The economic capital methodology is based on the probability of default, loss given default (LGD), exposure at default (EAD) and maturity for each credit exposure, and the portfolio correlations across exposures. See page 
57
for more information on
Credit Risk Management
.
Market Risk Capital
Market risk reflects the potential loss in the value of financial instruments or portfolios due to movements in interest and currency exchange rates, equity and futures prices, the implied volatility of interest rates, credit spreads and other economic and business factors. Bank of Americas primary market risk exposures are in its trading portfolio, equity investments, MSRs and the interest rate exposure of its core balance sheet. Economic capital is determined by utilizing the same models the Corporation used to manage these risks including, for example, Value-at-Risk (VaR), simulation, stress testing and scenario analysis. See page

Operational Risk Capital
We calculate operational risk capital at the business unit level using actuarial-based models and historical loss data. We supplement the calculations with scenario analysis and risk control assessments. See

Enterprise-wide Stress Testing
As a part of our core risk management practices, we conduct enterprise-wide stress tests on a periodic basis to better understand balance sheet, earnings, capital and liquidity sensitivities to certain economic and business scenarios, including economic and market conditions that are more severe than anticipated. These enterprise-wide stress tests provide an understanding of the potential impacts from our risk profile on our balance sheet, earnings, capital and liquidity and serve as a key component of our capital and risk management practices. Scenarios are selected by a group comprised of senior business, risk and finance executives. Impacts to each business from each scenario are then determined and analyzed, primarily by leveraging the models and processes utilized in everyday management routines. Impacts are assessed along with potential mitigating actions that may be taken. Analysis from such stress scenarios is compiled for and reviewed through our Chief Financial Officer Risk Committee (CFORC), Asset Liability and Market Risk Committee (ALMRC) and the Boards Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC) and serves to inform decision making by management and the Board. We have made substantial investments to establish stress testing capabilities as a core business process.
 
Liquidity Risk
Funding and Liquidity Risk Management
We define liquidity risk as the potential inability to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations, on- or off-balance sheet, as they come due. Our primary liquidity objective is to ensure adequate funding for our businesses throughout market cycles, including periods of financial stress. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk, maintain excess liquidity and access diverse funding sources including our stable deposit base. We define excess liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our funding requirements as those obligations arise.
Global funding and liquidity risk management activities are centralized within Corporate Treasury. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity risk management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events.
The Enterprise Risk Committee approves the Corporations liquidity policy and contingency funding plan, including establishing liquidity risk tolerance levels. The ALMRC, in conjunction with the Board and its committees, monitors our liquidity position and reviews the impact of strategic decisions on our liquidity. ALMRC is responsible for managing liquidity risks and ensuring exposures remain within the established tolerance levels. ALMRC delegates additional oversight responsibilities to the CFORC, which reports to the ALMRC. The CFORC reviews and monitors our liquidity position, cash flow forecasts, stress testing scenarios and results, and implements our liquidity limits and guidelines. For more information, see
Board Oversight of Risk
on page
47
. Under this governance framework, we have developed certain funding and liquidity risk management practices which include: maintaining excess liquidity at the parent company and selected subsidiaries, including our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries; determining what amounts of excess liquidity are appropriate for these entities based on analysis of debt maturities and other potential cash outflows, including those that we may experience during stressed market conditions; diversifying funding sources, considering our asset profile and legal entity structure; and performing contingency planning.
Global Excess Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets
We maintain excess liquidity available to Bank of America Corporation, or the parent company, and selected subsidiaries in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. These assets, which we call our Global Excess Liquidity Sources, serve as our primary means of liquidity risk mitigation. Our cash is primarily on deposit with central banks, such as the Federal Reserve. We limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and a select group of non-U.S. government and supranational securities. We believe we can quickly obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed market conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold our Global Excess Liquidity Sources in entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities.
Our Global Excess Liquidity Sources
increased
$42 billion
to
$378 billion
compared to
December 31, 2010
and were maintained as presented in
Table 17
. This increase was due primarily to liquidity generated by our bank subsidiaries through deposit growth, reductions in LHFS and other factors. Partially offsetting the increase were the results of our ongoing reductions of our debt footprint announced in 2010.
As shown in
Table 17
, the Global Excess Liquidity Sources available to the parent company totaled
$125 billion
and
$121 billion
at

. These amounts are distinct from the cash deposited by the parent company presented in
Table 17
. In addition to their Global Excess Liquidity Sources, our bank subsidiaries hold significant amounts of other unencumbered securities that we believe could also be used to generate liquidity, primarily investment-grade MBS. Our bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of other unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was approximately $189 billion and $170 billion at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can only be used to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries and can only be transferred to the parent company or non-bank subsidiaries with prior regulatory approval.
Global Excess Liquidity Sources available to our broker/dealer subsidiaries at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
totaled
$31 billion
and
$35 billion
. Our broker/dealers also held significant amounts of other unencumbered securities that we believe could also be used to generate additional liquidity, including investment-grade securities and equities. Liquidity held in a broker/dealer subsidiary
 
is only available to meet the obligations of that entity and can only be transferred to the parent company or to any other subsidiary with prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements.
Time to Required Funding and Stress Modeling
We use a variety of metrics to determine the appropriate amounts of excess liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries. One metric we use to evaluate the appropriate level of excess liquidity at the parent company is Time to Required Funding. This debt coverage measure indicates the number of months that the parent company can continue to meet its unsecured contractual obligations as they come due using only its Global Excess Liquidity Sources without issuing any new debt or accessing any additional liquidity sources. We define unsecured contractual obligations for purposes of this metric as maturities of senior or subordinated debt issued or guaranteed by Bank of America Corporation or Merrill Lynch. These include certain unsecured debt instruments, primarily structured liabilities, which we may be required to settle for cash prior to maturity and issuances under the FDICs Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP), all of which will mature by June 30, 2012. The Corporation has established a target for Time to Required Funding of 21 months. Our Time to Required Funding at
December 31, 2011
was 29 months. For purposes of calculating Time to Required Funding for
December 31, 2011
, we have also included in the amount of unsecured contractual obligations the $8.6 billion liability related to the BNY Mellon Settlement. This settlement is subject to final court approval and certain other conditions, and the timing of the payment is not certain.
We utilize liquidity stress models to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of excess liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries. These models are risk sensitive and have become increasingly important in analyzing our potential contractual and contingent cash outflows beyond those outflows considered in the Time to Required Funding analysis.
We evaluate the liquidity requirements under a range of scenarios with varying levels of severity and time horizons. These scenarios incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events, including potential credit ratings downgrades for the parent company and our subsidiaries. We consider and utilize scenarios based on historical experience, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future events.
The types of contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited to, upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions in new debt issuance; diminished access to secured financing markets; potential deposit withdrawals and reduced rollover of maturing term deposits by customers; increased draws on loan commitment and liquidity facilities, including Variable Rate Demand Notes; additional collateral that counterparties could call if our credit ratings were further downgraded; collateral, margin and subsidiary capital requirements arising from losses; and potential liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer activities.
We consider all sources of funds that we could access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset-liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses.
Basel III Liquidity Standards
In December 2010, the Basel Committee issued International framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring, which includes two proposed measures of liquidity risk. These two minimum liquidity measures were initially introduced in guidance in December 2009 and are considered part of Basel III.
The first proposed liquidity measure is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which is calculated as the amount of a financial institutions unencumbered, high-quality, liquid assets relative to the net cash outflows the institution could encounter under an acute 30-day stress scenario. The second proposed liquidity measure is the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), which measures the amount of longer-term, stable sources of funding employed by a financial institution relative to the liquidity profiles of the assets funded and the potential for contingent calls on funding liquidity arising from off-balance sheet commitments and obligations over a one-year period. The Basel Committee expects the LCR requirement to be implemented in January 2015 and the NSFR requirement to be implemented in January 2018, following an observation period that began in 2011. We continue to monitor the development and the potential impact of these proposals, and assuming adoption by U.S. banking regulators, we expect to meet the final standards within the regulatory timelines.
Diversified Funding Sources
We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits and secured and unsecured liabilities through a globally coordinated funding strategy. We diversify our funding globally across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups.
We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposit base, which was
$1,033 billion
and
$1,010 billion
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. Deposits are primarily generated by our
CBB
,
Global Banking and
GWIM
segments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product type and geography and the majority of our U.S. deposits are insured by the FDIC. We consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of funding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources. Our lending activities may also be financed through secured borrowings, including securitizations and FHLB loans.
Our trading activities in broker/dealer subsidiaries are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. We believe funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more cost efficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing. Repurchase agreements are generally short-term and often overnight. Disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such financing. We manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate.
We reduced our use of unsecured short-term borrowings at the parent company and broker/dealer subsidiaries, including commercial paper and master notes, to relatively insignificant amounts in
2011
. These short-term borrowings were used to support customer activities, short-term financing requirements and cash management objectives. For average and period-end
 
balance discussions, see
Balance Sheet Overview

. For more information, see
Note 12  Federal Funds Sold, Securities Borrowed or Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Short-term Borrowings
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
Our mortgage business accesses a liquid market for the sale of newly originated mortgages through contracts with the GSEs and FHA. Contracts with the GSEs are subject to the seller/servicer guides issued by the GSEs.
We issue the majority of our long-term unsecured debt at the parent company. During
2011
, the parent company issued $21.0 billion of long-term unsecured debt. We may also issue long-term unsecured debt at BANA, although there were no new issuances during
2011
.
We issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or the Corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or quarter.
The primary benefits of our centralized funding strategy include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone differences or other business considerations make parent company funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt.
At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, our long-term debt was in the currencies presented in
Table 19
.
Total long-term debt
decreased
$76.2 billion
, or
17 percent
in
2011
. This decrease reflects our ongoing initiative to reduce our debt footprint over time, and we anticipate that we will continue to reduce our debt footprint as appropriate through 2013. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt securities in various transactions, depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity and other factors. In addition, we also may make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. For additional information on long-term debt funding, see
Note 13  Long-term Debt
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For further details on our ALM activities, see
Interest Rate Risk Management for Nontrading Activities
on page
93
.
We also diversify our unsecured funding sources by issuing various types of debt instruments including structured liabilities,
which are debt obligations that pay investors with returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivative positions and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured liability obligations for cash or other securities immediately under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. We had outstanding structured liabilities with a book value of $50.9 billion and $61.1 billion at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
.
Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price.
Prior to 2010, we participated in the TLGP, which allowed us to issue senior unsecured debt that the FDIC guaranteed in return for a fee based on the amount and maturity of the debt. At
December 31, 2011
, we had $23.9 billion outstanding under the program. We no longer issue debt under this program and all of our debt issued under TLGP will mature by June 30, 2012. TLGP issuances are included in the unsecured contractual obligations for the Time to Required Funding metric. Under this program, our debt received the highest long-term ratings from the major credit rating agencies which resulted in a lower total cost of issuance than if we had issued non-FDIC guaranteed long-term debt.
Contingency Planning
We maintain contingency funding plans that outline our potential responses to liquidity stress events at various levels of severity. These policies and plans are based on stress scenarios and include potential funding strategies and communication and notification procedures that we would implement in the event we experienced stressed liquidity conditions. We periodically review and test the contingency funding plans to validate efficacy and assess readiness.
Our U.S. bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries have access to central bank facilities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. While we do not rely on these sources in our liquidity modeling, we maintain the policies, procedures and governance processes that would enable us to access these sources if necessary.
Credit Ratings
Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including OTC derivatives. Thus, it is our objective to maintain high-quality credit ratings.
Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies which consider a number of factors, including our own financial strength,
 
performance, prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control. The rating agencies could make adjustments to our ratings at any time and provide no assurances that they will maintain our ratings at current levels.
Other factors that influence our credit ratings include changes to the rating agencies methodologies for our industry or certain security types, the rating agencies assessment of the general operating environment for financial services companies, our mortgage exposures, our relative positions in the markets in which we compete, reputation, liquidity position, diversity of funding sources, funding costs, the level and volatility of earnings, corporate governance and risk management policies, capital position, capital management practices and current or future regulatory and legislative initiatives.
Each of the three primary rating agencies, Moodys, S&P and Fitch, downgraded the Corporation and its subsidiaries in late 2011. They have each also indicated that, as a systemically important financial institution, our credit ratings currently reflect their expectation that, if necessary, we would receive significant support from the U.S. government. They have indicated that they will continue to assess this view of support as financial services regulations and legislation evolve. On December 15, 2011, Fitch downgraded the Corporations and BANAs long-term and short-term debt ratings as a result of Fitchs decision to lower its support floor for systemically important U.S. financial institutions. This downgrade resolves the Rating Watch Negative Fitch placed on the Corporations ratings on October 22, 2010. On November 29, 2011, S&P downgraded the Corporations long-term and short-term debt ratings as well as BANAs long-term debt rating as a result of S&Ps implementation of revised methodologies for determining Banking Industry Country Risk Assessments and bank ratings. On September 21, 2011, Moodys downgraded the Corporations long-term and short-term debt ratings as well as BANAs long-term debt rating as a result of Moodys lowering the amount of uplift for potential U.S. government support it incorporates into ratings. On February 15, 2012, Moodys placed the Corporations long-term debt ratings and BANAs long-term and short-term debt ratings on review for possible downgrade as part of its review of financial institutions with global capital markets operations. Any adjustment to our ratings will be determined based on Moodys review; however, the agency offered guidance that downgrades to our ratings, if any, would likely be limited to one notch. The rating agencies could make further adjustments to our ratings at any time and provide no assurances that they will maintain our ratings at current levels.
Currently, the Corporations long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies are as follows: Baa1/P-2 (negative) by Moodys; A-/A-2 (negative) by S&P; and A/F1 (stable) by Fitch. BANAs long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks currently are as follows: A2/P-1 (negative) by Moodys; A/A-1 (negative) by S&P; and A/F1 (stable) by Fitch. MLPF&Ss long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks are A/A-1 (negative) by S&P and A/F1 (stable) by Fitch. Merrill Lynch Internationals long-term/short-term senior debt ratings are A/A-1 (negative) by S&P. The credit ratings of Merrill Lynch from the three primary credit rating agencies are the same as those of Bank of America Corporation. The primary credit rating agencies have indicated that the major drivers of Merrill Lynchs credit ratings are Bank of America Corporations credit ratings.
A further reduction in certain of our credit ratings or the ratings of certain asset-backed securitizations may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, potential loss of access to credit
markets, the related cost of funds, our businesses and on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where counterparty creditworthiness is critical. In addition, under the terms of certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, the counterparties to those agreements may require us to provide additional collateral, or to terminate these contracts or agreements, which could cause us to sustain losses and/or adversely impact our liquidity. If the short-term credit ratings of our parent company, bank or broker/dealer subsidiaries were downgraded by one or more levels, the potential loss of access to short-term funding sources such as repo financing, and the effect on our incremental cost of funds could be material.
At December 31, 2011, if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch, the amount of additional collateral contractually required by derivative contracts and other trading agreements would have been approximately
$2.5 billion
comprised of
$2.1 billion
for BANA and approximately
$403 million
for Merrill Lynch and certain of its subsidiaries. If the agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for these entities by a second incremental notch, approximately
$2.0 billion
in additional collateral comprised of
$1.5 billion
for BANA and
$522 million
for Merrill Lynch and certain of its subsidiaries, would have been required.
Also, if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch, the derivative liability that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties as of December 31, 2011 was
$2.9 billion
, against which
$2.7 billion
of collateral had been posted. If the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries a second incremental notch, the derivative liability that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties as of December 31, 2011 was an incremental
$5.6 billion
, against which
$5.4 billion
of collateral had been posted.
While certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable, the full scope of consequences of a credit ratings downgrade to a financial institution are inherently uncertain, as they depend upon numerous dynamic, complex and inter-related factors and assumptions, including whether any downgrade of a firms long-term credit ratings precipitates downgrades to its short-term credit ratings, and assumptions about the potential behaviors of various customers, investors and counterparties.
For information regarding the additional collateral and termination payments that could be required in connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements as a result of such a credit ratings downgrade, see
Note 4  Derivatives
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
and
Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K
.
During the third quarter of 2011, Moodys and S&P placed the sovereign rating of the United States on review for possible downgrade due to the possibility of a default on the governments debt obligations because of a failure to increase the debt limit. On August 2, 2011, Moodys affirmed its Aaa rating and revised its outlook to negative. On August 5, 2011, S&P downgraded the
 
long-term sovereign credit rating of the United States to AA+, and affirmed the short-term sovereign credit rating; the outlook is negative. On November 28, 2011, Fitch affirmed its AAA long-term rating of the United States, but changed the outlook from stable to negative. On the same day, Fitch affirmed its F1+ short-term rating of the U.S. All three rating agencies have indicated that they will continue to assess fiscal projections and consolidation measures, as well as the medium-term economic outlook for the United States.
Credit Risk Management
Credit quality continued to improve during
2011
. Continued economic stability and our proactive credit risk management initiatives positively impacted the credit portfolio as charge-offs and delinquencies continued to improve across most portfolios and risk ratings improved in the commercial portfolios. However, global and national economic uncertainty, home price declines and regulatory reform continued to weigh on the credit portfolios through
December 31, 2011
. For more information, see
Executive Summary  2011 Economic and Business Environment

.
Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations. Credit risk can also arise from operational failures that result in an erroneous advance, commitment or investment of funds. We define the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the loss potential arising from all product classifications including loans and leases, deposit overdrafts, derivatives, assets held-for-sale and unfunded lending commitments which include loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees. Derivative positions are recorded at fair value and assets held-for-sale are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Certain loans and unfunded commitments are accounted for under the fair value option. Credit risk for these categories of assets is not accounted for as part of the allowance for credit losses but as part of the fair value adjustments recorded in earnings. For derivative positions, our credit risk is measured as the net cost in the event the counterparties
with contracts in which we are in a gain position fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. We use the current mark-to-market value to represent credit exposure without giving consideration to future mark-to-market changes. The credit risk amounts take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. Our consumer and commercial credit extension and review procedures take into account funded and unfunded credit exposures. For additional information on derivative and credit extension commitments, see
Note 4  Derivatives
and
Note 14  Commitments and Contingencies
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower or counterparty, repayment sources, the nature of underlying collateral, and other support given current events, conditions and expectations. We classify our portfolios as either consumer or commercial and monitor credit risk in each as discussed below.
We proactively refine our underwriting and credit management practices as well as credit standards to meet the changing economic environment. To actively mitigate losses and enhance customer support in our consumer businesses, we have expanded collections, loan modification and customer assistance infrastructures. We also have implemented a number of actions to mitigate losses in the commercial businesses including increasing the frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring, hedging activity and our practice of transferring management of deteriorating commercial exposures to independent special asset officers as credits enter criticized categories.
Since January 2008, and through
2011
, Bank of America and Countrywide have completed over one million loan modifications with customers. During
2011
, we completed over 225,000 customer loan modifications with a total unpaid principal balance of approximately $49.9 billion, including approximately 104,000 permanent modifications under the governments Making Home Affordable Program. Of the loan modifications completed in
2011
, in terms of both the volume of modifications and the unpaid principal balance associated with the underlying loans, most were in the portfolio serviced for investors and were not on our balance sheet. The most common types of modifications include a combination of rate reduction and capitalization of past due amounts which represent 60 percent of the volume of modifications completed in
2011
, while principal forbearance represented 19 percent, principal reductions and forgiveness represented six percent and capitalization of past due amounts represented eight percent. These modification types are generally considered troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). For more information on TDRs and portfolio impacts, see

Certain European countries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, continue to experience varying degrees of financial stress. In early 2012, S&P, Fitch and Moodys downgraded the credit ratings of several European countries, and S&P downgraded the credit rating of the EFSF, adding to concerns about investor appetite for continued support in stabilizing the affected countries. Uncertainty in the progress of debt restructuring negotiations and the lack of a clear resolution to the crisis has led to continued volatility in the European financial markets, and if the situation worsens, may spread into the global financial markets. In December 2011, the ECB announced initiatives to address European bank liquidity and funding concerns by providing low-cost three-year loans to banks, and expanding collateral eligibility. While these initiatives may reduce systemic risk, there remains considerable uncertainty as to future developments regarding the European debt crisis.

Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management
Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrowers credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience. These models are a component of our consumer credit risk management process and are used in part to help make both new and existing credit decisions and portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses, and economic capital allocations for credit risk.
For information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and TDRs for the consumer portfolio, see
Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Principles
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
Consumer Credit Portfolio
Improvement in the U.S. economy and labor markets during 2011 resulted in lower credit losses in most consumer portfolios during
2011
compared to
2010
. However, continued stress in the housing market, including declines in home prices, continued to adversely impact the home loans portfolio.
Table 20
presents our outstanding consumer loans and the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio. Loans that were acquired from Countrywide and considered credit-impaired were recorded at fair value upon acquisition. In addition to being included in the Outstandings columns in
Table 20
, these loans are also shown separately, net of purchase accounting adjustments, in the Countrywide Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio column. For additional information, see
Note 6  Outstanding Loans and Leases
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
. The impact of the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio on certain credit statistics is reported where appropriate. See
Countrywide Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio
on page 
66
for more information. Under certain circumstances, loans that were originally classified as discontinued real estate loans upon acquisition have been subsequently modified from pay option or subprime loans into loans with more conventional terms and are now included in the residential mortgage portfolio, but continue to be classified as PCI loans as shown in
Table 20
.
n/a = not applicable
Table 21
presents accruing consumer loans past due 90 days or more and consumer nonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans, consumer non-real estate-secured loans or unsecured consumer loans as these loans are generally charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. Real estate-secured past due consumer loans, which include loans insured by the FHA and individually insured long-term stand-by agreements with FNMA and FHLMC (fully-insured loan portfolio), are reported as accruing as opposed to nonperforming since the principal
 
repayment is insured. Fully-insured loans included in accruing past due 90 days or more are primarily related to our purchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements. Additionally, nonperforming loans and accruing balances past due 90 days or more do not include the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio or loans accounted for under the fair value option even though the customer may be contractually past due.

manages our exposures to certain residential mortgage, home equity and discontinued real estate products. Legacy Assets & Servicing manages both our owned loans, as well as loans serviced for others, that meet certain criteria. The criteria generally represent home lending standards which we do not consider as part of our continuing core business. The Legacy Assets & Servicing portfolio includes the following:

presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by the Core portfolio and the Legacy Assets & Servicing portfolio for the home loans portfolio.
We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following discussions of the residential mortgage, home equity and discontinued real
 
estate portfolios, we provide information that excludes the impact of the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option in certain credit quality statistics. We separately disclose information on the Countrywide PCI loan portfolios on page
66
.
Residential Mortgage
The residential mortgage portfolio, which for purposes of the consumer credit portfolio discussion and related tables, excludes the discontinued real estate portfolio acquired from Countrywide, makes up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 43 percent of consumer loans at
December 31, 2011
. Approximately 14 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio is in
GWIM
and represents residential mortgages that are originated for the home purchase and refinancing needs of our wealth management clients. The remaining portion of the portfolio is mostly in
All Other
and is comprised of both originated loans as well as purchased loans used in our overall ALM activities.
Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio, excluding
$906 million
of loans accounted for under the fair value option,
increased
$4.3 billion
at
December 31, 2011
compared to
December 31, 2010
as new origination volume, the majority of which is fully-insured, was partially offset by paydowns, charge-offs and transfers to foreclosed properties. In addition, repurchases of FHA delinquent loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA also
increased
the residential mortgage portfolio during
2011
. At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the residential mortgage portfolio included
$93.9 billion
and
$67.2 billion
of outstanding fully-insured loans. On this portion of the residential mortgage portfolio, we are protected against principal loss as a result of FHA insurance and long-term stand-by agreements with FNMA and FHLMC. At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, $24.0 billion and $20.1 billion were related to repurchases of FHA delinquent loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA and the remainder of the fully-insured portfolio represents originations that were retained on-balance sheet.
At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, principal balances of $23.8 billion and $12.9 billion were protected by long-term stand-by agreements. All of these loans are individually insured and therefore the Corporation does not record an allowance for credit losses.
In addition to the abovementioned long-term stand-by agreements with FNMA and FHLMC, we have mitigated a portion
 
of our credit risk on the residential mortgage portfolio through the use of synthetic securitization vehicles as described in
Note 6  Outstanding Loans and Leases
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the synthetic securitization vehicles referenced principal balances of
$23.9 billion
and
$53.9 billion
of residential mortgage loans and provided loss protection up to
$783 million
and
$1.1 billion
. At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Corporation had a receivable of
$359 million
and
$722 million
from these vehicles for reimbursement of losses. The Corporation records an allowance for credit losses on loans referenced by the synthetic securitization vehicles. The reported net charge-offs for the residential mortgage portfolio do not include the benefit of amounts reimbursable from these vehicles. Adjusting for the benefit of the credit protection from the synthetic securitizations, the residential mortgage net charge-off ratio, excluding the Countrywide PCI and fully-insured loan portfolios, for
2011
would have been reduced by 13 bps and eight bps for

Synthetic securitizations and the long-term stand-by agreements with FNMA and FHLMC together reduce our regulatory risk-weighted assets due to the transfer of a portion of our credit risk to unaffiliated parties. At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, these programs had the cumulative effect of reducing our risk-weighted assets by $7.9 billion and $8.2 billion, increased our Tier 1 capital ratio by eight bps and six bps, and our Tier 1 common capital ratio by six bps and five bps.
Table 24
presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis and excluding the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. We believe the presentation of information adjusted to exclude these loan portfolios is more representative of the credit risk in the residential mortgage loan portfolio. As such, the following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option.

Nonperforming residential mortgage loans
decreased
$1.7 billion
compared to
December 31, 2010
as outflows outpaced new inflows, which continued to slow in
2011
due to favorable delinquency trends. Accruing loans past due 30 days or more
decreased
$1.2 billion
to
$4.0 billion
at
December 31, 2011
. At
December 31, 2011
, $11.4 billion, or 71 percent, of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell. Net charge-offs
increased
$162 million
to
$3.8 billion
in
2011
, or
2.27 percent
of total average residential mortgage loans, compared to
1.86 percent
for
2010
. This
increase
in net charge-offs for
2011
was primarily driven by further deterioration in home prices on loans greater than 180 days past due which were written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell, partially offset by favorable delinquency trends. Net charge-off ratios were further impacted by lower loan balances primarily due to paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new originations.
Loans in the residential mortgage portfolio with certain characteristics have greater risk of loss than others. These characteristics include loans with a high refreshed LTV, loans originated at the peak of home prices in 2006 and 2007, interest-only loans and loans to borrowers located in California and Florida where we have concentrations and where significant declines in home prices have been experienced. Although the following disclosures address each of these risk characteristics separately, there is significant overlap in loans with these characteristics, which contributed to a disproportionate share of the losses in the portfolio. The residential mortgage loans with all of these higher risk characteristics comprised six percent of the residential mortgage portfolio at both
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, but accounted for 23 percent of the residential mortgage net charge-offs in
2011
and 26 percent in
2010
.
Residential mortgage loans with a greater than 90 percent but less than 100 percent refreshed LTV represented
11 percent
of the residential mortgage portfolio at both
December 31, 2011 and 2010
. Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent represented
26 percent
and
24 percent
of the residential mortgage loan portfolio at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
. Of the loans with
 
a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent, 92 percent and 88 percent were performing at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
. Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where the outstanding carrying value of the loan is greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. The majority of these loans have a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent due primarily to home price deterioration over the past several years. Loans to borrowers with refreshed FICO scores below 620 represented
15 percent
of the residential mortgage portfolio at both
December 31, 2011 and 2010
.
Of the
$158.5 billion
and
$180.1 billion
in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, as shown in
Table 24
, 40 percent and 38 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $13.3 billion, or 21 percent, at
December 31, 2011
. Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. As of
December 31, 2011
, $484 million, or four percent, of outstanding residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $4.0 billion, or two percent, of accruing past due 30 days or more for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at
December 31, 2011
, $2.0 billion, or 15 percent, of outstanding residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming compared to $16.0 billion, or 10 percent, of nonperforming loans for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. Loans in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio have an interest-only period of three to 10 years and more than 80 percent of these loans will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2015 or later.
Table 25
presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 12 percent and 13 percent of outstandings at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, but comprised only seven percent of net charge-offs for both
2011
and
2010
.
The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) encourages banks to meet the credit needs of their communities for housing and other purposes, particularly in neighborhoods with low or moderate incomes. At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, our CRA portfolio was $12.5 billion and $13.8 billion, or eight percent of the residential mortgage loan balances for both periods. The CRA portfolio included $2.5 billion and $3.0 billion of nonperforming loans at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
representing 15 percent and 17 percent of total nonperforming residential mortgage loans. Net charge-offs related to the CRA portfolio were $732 million and $857 million for
2011
and
2010
, or 19 percent and 23 percent of total net charge-offs for the residential mortgage portfolio.

Home Equity
The home equity portfolio makes up
20 percent
of the consumer portfolio and is comprised of HELOCs, home equity loans and reverse mortgages. As of
December 31, 2011
, our HELOC portfolio had an outstanding balance of $103.4 billion or 83 percent of the home equity portfolio. HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years with approximately 11 percent of the portfolio having a draw period of five years with a five-year renewal option. During the initial draw period, the borrowers are only required to pay the interest due on the loans on a monthly basis. After the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15-year amortizing loans.
As of
December 31, 2011
, our home equity loan portfolio had an outstanding balance of $20.2 billion, or 16 percent of the home equity portfolio. Home equity loans are almost all fixed-rate loans
 
with amortizing payment terms of 10 to 30 years and approximately 52 percent of these loans have 25 to 30-year terms.
As of
December 31, 2011
, our reverse mortgage portfolio had an outstanding balance of $1.1 billion, or one percent of the total home equity portfolio. In 2011, we exited the reverse mortgage origination business.
At
December 31, 2011
, approximately 88 percent of the home equity portfolio was included in
CRES
while the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in
GWIM
. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio
decreased
$13.3 billion
in
2011
primarily due to paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home equity portfolio at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, $24.5 billion, or 20 percent, and $24.8 billion, or 18 percent, were in first-lien positions (22 percent and 20 percent excluding the Countrywide PCI home equity portfolio). As of
December 31, 2011
, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $37.2 billion, or 33 percent, of our home equity portfolio excluding the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio.
Unused HELOCs totaled $67.5 billion at
December 31, 2011
compared to $80.1 billion at
December 31, 2010
. This decrease was due primarily to customers choosing to close accounts as well as line management initiatives on deteriorating accounts, which more than offset new production. The HELOC utilization rate was 61 percent at
December 31, 2011
compared to 59 percent at
December 31, 2010
.
Table 26
presents certain home equity portfolio key credit statistics on both a reported basis as well as excluding the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio. We believe the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio is more representative of the credit risk in this portfolio.
The following discussion presents the home equity portfolio excluding the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio.
Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio
decreased
$241 million
compared to
December 31, 2010
driven primarily by charge-offs and nonperforming loans returning to performing status which together outpaced
 
delinquency inflows, which continued to slow during
2011
due to favorable early stage delinquency trends. Accruing outstanding balances past due 30 days or more
decreased
$271 million
in
2011
. At
December 31, 2011
, $1.1 billion, or 43 percent, of the nonperforming home equity portfolio was 180 days or more past due and had been written down to their fair values.
In some cases, the junior-lien home equity outstanding balance that we hold is current, but the underlying first-lien is not. For outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio in which we service the first-lien loan, we are able to track whether the first-lien loan is in default. For loans in which the first-lien is serviced by a third party, we utilize credit bureau data to estimate the delinquency status of the first-lien. Given that the credit bureau database we use does not include a property address for the mortgages, we are unable to identify with certainty whether a reported delinquent first mortgage pertains to the same property for which we hold a second- or more junior-lien loan. As of
December 31, 2011
, we estimate that
$4.7 billion
of current second- or more junior-lien loans were behind a delinquent first-lien loan. We service the first-lien loans on $1.3 billion of that amount, with the remaining $3.4 billion serviced by third parties. Of the
$4.7 billion
current second-lien loans, we estimate based on available credit bureau data as discussed above that approximately $2.5 billion had first-lien loans that were 120 days or more past due, of which approximately $2.1 billion had first-lien loans serviced by third parties.
Net charge-offs
decreased
$2.3 billion
to
$4.5 billion
, or
3.77 percent
of the total average home equity portfolio, for
2011
compared to
$6.8 billion
, or
5.10 percent
, for
2010
primarily driven by favorable portfolio trends due in part to improvement in the U.S. economy. In addition, the net charge-off amounts during
2010
were impacted by the implementation of regulatory guidance on collateral-dependent modified loans which resulted in $822 million in net charge-offs. Net charge-off ratios were further impacted by lower outstanding balances primarily as a result of paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines.
There are certain characteristics of the outstanding loan balances in the home equity portfolio that have contributed to higher losses including those loans with a high refreshed combined loan-to-value (CLTV), loans that were originated at the peak of home prices in 2006 and 2007 and loans in geographic areas that have experienced the most significant declines in home prices. Home price declines coupled with the fact that most home equity outstandings are secured by second-lien positions have significantly reduced and, in some cases, eliminated all collateral value after consideration of the first-lien position. Although the disclosures below address each of these risk characteristics separately, there is significant overlap in outstanding balances with these characteristics, which has contributed to a disproportionate share of losses in the portfolio. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio with all of these higher risk characteristics comprised 10 percent of the total home equity portfolio at both
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, but have accounted for 28 percent of the home equity net charge-offs in 2011 and 29 percent in
2010
.
 
Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio with greater than 90 percent but less than 100 percent refreshed CLTVs comprised
11 percent
of the home equity portfolio at both
December 31, 2011 and 2010
. Outstanding balances with refreshed CLTVs greater than 100 percent comprised
32 percent
and
30 percent
of the home equity portfolio at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where the carrying value and available line of credit of the combined loans are equal to or greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. Depending on the value of the property, there may be collateral in excess of the first-lien that is available to reduce the severity of loss on the second-lien. Home price deterioration over the past several years has contributed to an increase in CLTV ratios. Of those outstanding balances with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent, 95 percent of the customers were current at
December 31, 2011
. For second-lien loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent that are current, 89 percent were also current on the underlying first-lien loans at
December 31, 2011
. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented
12 percent
of the home equity portfolio at both
December 31, 2011 and 2010
.
Of the
$112.7 billion
in total home equity portfolio outstandings, 78 percent and 75 percent at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
were originated as interest-only loans, almost all of which were HELOCs. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have entered the amortization period was $1.6 billion, or two percent of total HELOCs, at
December 31, 2011
. The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. As of
December 31, 2011
, $49 million, or three percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $1.4 billion, or one percent, of outstanding accruing past due 30 days or more for the entire HELOC portfolio. In addition, at
December 31, 2011
, $57 million, or four percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming compared to $2.0 billion, or two percent, of outstandings that were nonperforming for the entire HELOC portfolio. Loans in our HELOC portfolio generally have an initial draw period of 10 years and more than 85 percent of these loans will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2015 or later.
Although we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period (i.e., customers may draw on and repay their line of credit, but are generally only required to pay interest on a monthly basis). During
2011
, approximately 51 percent of these customers did not pay down any principal on their HELOCs.
Table 27
presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 11 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both
December 31, 2011 and 2010
. This MSA comprised seven percent and six percent of net charge-offs for
2011
and
2010
. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 12 percent and 11 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at
December 31, 2011 and
 
2010
. This MSA comprised 12 percent and 11 percent of net charge-offs for
2011
and
2010
.

Discontinued Real Estate
The discontinued real estate portfolio, excluding
$1.3 billion
of loans accounted for under the fair value option, totaled
$11.1 billion
at
December 31, 2011
and consists of pay option and subprime loans acquired in the Countrywide acquisition. Upon acquisition, the majority of the discontinued real estate portfolio was considered credit-impaired and written down to fair value. At
December 31, 2011
, the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio was
$9.9 billion
, or
89 percent
of the total discontinued real estate portfolio. This portfolio is included in
All Other
and is managed as part of our overall ALM activities. See
Countrywide Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio
on page
66
for more information on the discontinued real estate portfolio.
At
December 31, 2011
, the purchased discontinued real estate portfolio that was not credit-impaired was
$1.2 billion
. Loans with greater than 90 percent refreshed LTVs and CLTVs comprised 28 percent of the portfolio and those with refreshed FICO scores below 620 represented 44 percent of the portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 16 percent of outstanding discontinued real estate loans at
December 31, 2011
.
Pay option adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which are included in the discontinued real estate portfolio, have interest rates that adjust monthly and minimum required payments that adjust annually, subject to resetting of the loan if minimum payments are made and deferred interest limits are reached. Annual payment adjustments are subject to a 7.5 percent maximum change. To ensure that contractual loan payments are adequate to repay a loan, the fully-amortizing loan payment amount is re-established after the initial five- or 10-year period and again every five years thereafter. These payment adjustments are not subject to the 7.5 percent limit and may be substantial due to changes in interest rates and the addition of unpaid interest to the loan balance. Payment advantage ARMs have interest rates that are fixed for an initial period of five years. Payments are subject to reset if the minimum payments are made and deferred interest
 
limits are reached. If interest deferrals cause a loans principal balance to reach a certain level within the first 10 years of the life of the loan, the payment is reset to the interest-only payment; then at the 10-year point, the fully-amortizing payment is required.
The difference between the frequency of changes in a loans interest rates and payments along with a limitation on changes in the minimum monthly payments of 7.5 percent per year can result in payments that are not sufficient to pay all of the monthly interest charges (i.e., negative amortization). Unpaid interest is added to the loan balance until the loan balance increases to a specified limit, which can be no more than 115 percent of the original loan amount, at which time a new monthly payment amount adequate to repay the loan over its remaining contractual life is established.
At
December 31, 2011
, the unpaid principal balance of pay option loans was $11.7 billion, with a carrying amount of $9.9 billion, including $9.0 billion of loans that were credit-impaired upon acquisition, and accordingly, are reserved for based on a life-of-loan loss estimate. The total unpaid principal balance of pay option loans with accumulated negative amortization was $9.5 billion including $672 million of negative amortization. For those borrowers who are making payments in accordance with their contractual terms, the percentage electing to make only the minimum payment on option ARMs was 22 percent at
December 31, 2011
and 25 percent at
December 31, 2010
. We continue to evaluate our exposure to payment resets on the acquired negative-amortizing loans including the Countrywide PCI pay option loan portfolio and have taken into consideration several assumptions regarding this evaluation including prepayment and default rates. Of the loans in the pay option portfolio at
December 31, 2011
that have not already experienced a payment reset, seven percent are expected to reset in 2012 and approximately 17 percent are expected to reset thereafter. In addition, approximately seven percent are expected to prepay and approximately 69 percent are expected to default prior to being reset, most of which were severely delinquent as of
December 31, 2011
.
Countrywide Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio
Loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at purchase that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments are accounted for under the accounting guidance for PCI loans, which addresses accounting for differences between contractual and expected cash flows to be collected from the purchasers initial investment in loans if those differences are attributable, at least in part, to credit quality. Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the acquisition
 
date may include statistics such as past due status, refreshed FICO scores and refreshed LTVs. PCI loans are recorded at fair value upon acquisition and the applicable accounting guidance prohibits carrying over or recording a valuation allowance in the initial accounting.
Table 28
presents the unpaid principal balance, carrying value, related valuation allowance and the net carrying value as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance for the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
.
Of the unpaid principal balance at
December 31, 2011
, $12.7 billion was 180 days or more past due, including $9.0 billion of first-lien and $3.7 billion of home equity. Of the $22.1 billion that is less than 180 days past due, $19.1 billion, or 86 percent of the total unpaid principal balance was current based on the contractual terms while $1.6 billion, or seven percent, was in early stage delinquency. During
2011
, we recorded $2.1 billion of provision for credit losses for the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio including $1.1 billion for discontinued real estate, $667 million for home equity loans and $355 million for residential mortgage. This compared to a total provision of $2.3 billion in
2010
. Provision expense in
2011
was driven primarily by a more negative home price outlook versus previous expectations. For further information on the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio, see
Note 6  Outstanding Loans and Leases
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
Additional information is provided in the following sections on the Countrywide PCI residential mortgage, home equity and discontinued real estate loan portfolios.
Purchased Credit-impaired Residential Mortgage Loan Portfolio
The Countrywide PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio comprised
31 percent
of the total Countrywide PCI loan portfolio. Those loans to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 38 percent of the Countrywide PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio at
December 31, 2011
. Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 90 percent represented 62 percent of the
 
Countrywide PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, and 84 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at
December 31, 2011
. Those loans that were originally classified as Countrywide PCI discontinued real estate loans upon acquisition and have been subsequently modified are now included in the Countrywide PCI residential mortgage outstandings.
Table 29
presents outstandings net of purchase accounting adjustments and before the related valuation allowance, by certain state concentrations.
Purchased Credit-impaired Home Equity Loan Portfolio
The Countrywide PCI home equity portfolio comprised
38 percent
of the total Countrywide PCI loan portfolio. Those loans with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 27 percent of the Countrywide PCI home equity portfolio at
December 31, 2011
. Loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 90 percent represented 81 percent of the Countrywide PCI home equity portfolio after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, and 83 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at
December 31, 2011
.
Table 30
presents outstandings net of purchase accounting adjustments and before the related valuation allowance, by certain state concentrations.
Purchased Credit-impaired Discontinued Real Estate Loan Portfolio
The Countrywide PCI discontinued real estate loan portfolio comprised
31 percent
of the total Countrywide PCI loan portfolio. Those loans to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 61 percent of the Countrywide PCI discontinued real estate loan portfolio at
December 31, 2011
. Loans with a refreshed LTV, or CLTV in the case of second-liens, greater than 90 percent represented 40 percent of the Countrywide PCI discontinued real estate loan portfolio after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, and 84 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at
December 31, 2011
. Those loans that were originally classified as discontinued real estate loans upon acquisition and have been subsequently modified are now excluded from this portfolio and included in the Countrywide PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio, but remain in the PCI loan pool.

presents outstandings net of purchase accounting adjustments and before the related valuation adjustment, by certain state concentrations.
 
U.S. Credit Card
The consumer U.S. credit card portfolio is managed in
CBB
. Outstandings in the U.S. credit card loan portfolio
decreased
$11.5 billion
compared to
December 31, 2010
due to higher payment rates, charge-offs and portfolio divestitures. For
2011
, net charge-offs
decreased
$5.8 billion
to
$7.3 billion
compared to
2010
due to improvements in delinquencies, collections and bankruptcies as a result of an improved economic environment and the impact of higher credit quality originations. U.S. credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest
decreased
$2.1 billion
while loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest
decreased
$1.3 billion
compared to
December 31, 2010
due to improvement in the U.S. economy.
Table 32
presents certain key credit statistics for the consumer U.S. credit card portfolio.
Unused lines of credit for U.S. credit card totaled $368.1 billion and $399.7 billion at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
. The $31.6 billion decrease was driven by portfolio divestitures, closure of inactive accounts and account management initiatives on higher risk accounts.
Table 33
presents certain state concentrations for the U.S. credit card portfolio.
Non-U.S. Credit Card
During 2011, we sold our Canadian consumer card business and we are evaluating our remaining international consumer card portfolios. In light of these actions, the international consumer card portfolios were moved from
CBB
to
All Other
.
Outstandings in the non-U.S. credit card portfolio
decreased
$13.0 billion
in
2011
primarily due to the sale of the Canadian consumer credit card portfolio, lower origination volume and charge-offs. Net charge-offs
decreased
$1.0 billion
in
2011
to
$1.2 billion
due to the sale of previously charged-off loans, portfolio sales, and improvements in delinquencies, collections and insolvencies.
Unused lines of credit for non-U.S. credit card totaled $36.8 billion and $60.3 billion at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
. The $23.5 billion decrease was driven primarily by the sale of the Canadian consumer credit card portfolio.
Table 34
presents certain key credit statistics for the non-U.S. credit card portfolio.
 
Direct/Indirect Consumer
At
December 31, 2011
, approximately 48 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in
Global Banking
(dealer financial services - automotive, marine, aircraft and recreational vehicle loans), 36 percent was included in
GWIM
(principally other non-real estate-secured, unsecured personal loans and securities-based lending margin loans), nine percent was included in
CBB
(consumer personal loans) and the remainder was in
All Other
(student loans).
Outstanding loans and leases
decreased
$595 million
to
$89.7 billion
in
2011
due to lower outstandings in the unsecured consumer lending portfolio partially offset by
growth in securities-based lending and product transfers from U.S. commercial. For
2011
, net charge-offs
decreased
$1.9 billion
to
$1.5 billion
, or
1.64 percent
of total average direct/indirect loans compared to
3.45 percent
for
2010
. This decrease was primarily driven by improvements in delinquencies, collections and bankruptcies in the unsecured consumer lending portfolio as a result of an improved economic environment as well as reduced outstandings. An additional driver was lower net charge-offs in the dealer financial services portfolio due to the impact of higher credit quality originations and higher resale values.
Net charge-offs in the unsecured consumer lending portfolio decreased $1.6 billion to $1.1 billion in
2011
, or 10.93 percent of total average unsecured consumer lending loans compared to 17.24 percent for
2010
. Net charge-offs in the dealer financial services portfolio decreased $199 million to $293 million in 2011, or 0.69 percent of total average dealer financial services loans compared to 1.08 percent for 2010. Direct/indirect loans that were past due 30 days or more and still accruing interest declined $745 million to $1.9 billion at
December 31, 2011
compared to $2.6 billion at
December 31, 2010
due to improvements
in both the unsecured consumer lending and dealer financial services portfolios.
Table 35
presents certain state concentrations for the direct/indirect consumer loan portfolio.
Other Consumer
At
December 31, 2011
, approximately 96 percent of the
$2.7 billion
other consumer portfolio was associated with certain consumer finance businesses that we previously exited and non-U.S. consumer loan portfolios that are included in
All Other
. The remainder is primarily deposit overdrafts within
CBB
.
Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option
Outstanding consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option were
$2.2 billion
at
December 31, 2011
and include
$1.3 billion
of discontinued real estate loans and
$906 million
of residential mortgage loans as a result of the consolidation of VIEs. During
2011
, we recorded losses of $837 million resulting from changes in the fair value of the loan portfolio. These losses were offset by gains recorded on the related long-term debt.
Nonperforming Consumer Loans and Foreclosed Properties Activity
Table 36
presents nonperforming consumer loans and foreclosed properties activity during
2011
and
2010
. Nonperforming LHFS are excluded from nonperforming loans as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans and in general, past due consumer loans not secured by real estate as these loans are generally charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. The fully-insured loan portfolio is not reported as nonperforming as principal repayment is insured. Additionally, nonperforming loans do not include the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio or loans that we account for under the fair value option. For further information on nonperforming loans, see
Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Principles
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
. Nonperforming loans declined to
$18.8 billion
at
December 31, 2011
compared to
$20.9 billion
at
December 31, 2010
. Delinquency inflows to nonperforming loans slowed compared to the prior year due to favorable portfolio trends and were more than offset by charge-offs, nonperforming loans returning to performing status, and paydowns and payoffs.
The outstanding balance of a real estate-secured loan that is in excess of the estimated property value, after reducing the estimated property value for estimated costs to sell, is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes
 
180 days past due unless repayment of the loan is fully insured. At
December 31, 2011
, $14.6 billion, or 71 percent, of nonperforming consumer real estate loans and foreclosed properties had been written down to their estimated property value less estimated costs to sell, including $12.6 billion of nonperforming loans 180 days or more past due and $2.0 billion of foreclosed properties.
Foreclosed properties
increased
$742 million
in
2011
as additions outpaced liquidations. PCI loans are excluded from nonperforming loans as these loans were written down to fair value at the acquisition date. However, once the underlying real estate is acquired by the Corporation upon foreclosure of the delinquent PCI loan, it is included in foreclosed properties. Net changes to foreclosed properties related to PCI loans increased $411 million in
2011
. Not included in foreclosed properties at
December 31, 2011
was $1.4 billion of real estate that was acquired upon foreclosure of delinquent FHA-insured loans. We hold this real estate on our balance sheet until we convey these properties to the FHA. We exclude these amounts from our nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties activity as we will be reimbursed once the property is conveyed to the FHA for principal and, up to certain limits, costs incurred during the foreclosure process and interest incurred during the holding period. For additional information on the review of our foreclosure processes, see
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  Other Mortgage-related Matters
on page

.
Restructured Loans
Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. These concessions typically result from the Corporations loss mitigation activities and could include reductions in the interest rate, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions. Certain TDRs are classified as nonperforming at the time of restructuring and may only be returned to performing status after considering the borrowers sustained repayment performance under revised payment terms for a reasonable period, generally six months. Nonperforming TDRs, excluding those modified loans in the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio, are included in
Table 36
.
As a result of accounting guidance on PCI loans, beginning January 1, 2010, modifications of loans in the PCI loan portfolio do not result in removal of the loan from the PCI loan pool. TDRs in the consumer real estate portfolio that were removed from the
PCI loan portfolio prior to the adoption of this accounting guidance were $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, of which $477 million and $426 million were nonper-forming. These nonperforming loans are excluded from
Table 36
.
 
Nonperforming consumer real estate TDRs as a percentage of total nonperforming consumer loans and foreclosed properties increased to 26 percent at
December 31, 2011
from 16 percent at
December 31, 2010
.
Our policy is to record any losses in the value of foreclosed properties as a reduction in the allowance for loan and lease losses during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan to foreclosed properties. Thereafter, all gains and losses in value are recorded in noninterest expense. New foreclosed properties in
Table 36
are net of $352 million and $575 million of charge-offs for
2011
and
2010
, recorded during the first 90 days after transfer.
We also work with customers that are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans, while complying with Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) guidelines. Substantially all of our credit card and other consumer loan modifications involve a reduction in the cardholders interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all of which are considered to be TDRs (the renegotiated TDR portfolio). We make modifications primarily through internal renegotiation programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external renegotiation programs. The renegotiated TDR portfolio is excluded from
Table 36
, as substantially all of these loans remain on accrual status until either charged-off or paid in full. At
 
December 31, 2011
, our renegotiated TDR portfolio was
$7.1 billion
, of which
$5.5 billion
was current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms compared to
$11.4 billion
at
December 31, 2010
, of which
$8.7 billion
was current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. The decline in the renegotiated TDR portfolio was primarily driven by attrition throughout
2011
as well as lower new program enrollments. For more information on the renegotiated TDR portfolio, see
Note 6  Outstanding Loans and Leases
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
As a result of new accounting guidance on TDRs, loans that are participating in or that have been offered a binding trial modification are classified as TDRs. At
December 31, 2011
, we classified an additional
$2.6 billion
of home loans as TDRs that were participating in or had been offered a trial modification. These home loans had an aggregate allowance for credit losses of
$154 million
at
December 31, 2011
. For additional information, see
Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Principles
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
Table 37
presents TDRs for the home loans portfolio. Performing TDR balances are excluded from nonperforming loans in
Table 36
.
Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management
Credit risk management for the commercial portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of the borrower or counterparty based on an analysis of its financial position. As part of the overall credit risk assessment, our commercial credit exposures are assigned a risk rating and are subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards. Subsequent to loan origination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis, and if necessary, adjusted to reflect changes in the financial condition, cash flow, risk profile or outlook of a borrower or counterparty. In making credit decisions, we consider risk rating, collateral, country, industry and single name concentration limits while also balancing the total borrower or counterparty relationship. Our business and risk management personnel use a variety of tools to continuously monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform under its obligations. We use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios. In addition, risk ratings are a factor in determining the level of assigned economic capital and the allowance for credit losses.
For information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see
Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Principles
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
Management of Commercial Credit Risk
Concentrations
Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure do not result in undesirable levels of risk. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our international portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables
42
,
47
,
53
and
54
summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio.
 
As part of our ongoing risk mitigation initiatives, we attempt to work with clients experiencing financial difficulty to modify their loans to terms that better align with their current ability to pay. In situations where an economic concession has been granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, we identify these loans as TDRs.
We account for certain large corporate loans and loan commitments, including issued but unfunded letters of credit which are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes, that exceed our single name credit risk concentration guidelines under the fair value option. Lending commitments, both funded and unfunded, are actively managed and monitored, and as appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships may be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with the Corporations credit view and market perspectives determining the size and timing of the hedging activity. In addition, we purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain other credit exposures. To lessen the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, credit exposure may be added within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for treatment as accounting hedges. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income (loss).
Commercial Credit Portfolio
During
2011
, credit quality in the commercial loans portfolio showed improvement relative to
2010
. Commercial loans increased in
2011
primarily due to growth in commercial and industrial lending. Non-U.S. commercial loan growth, centered in corporate loans and trade finance, was driven by higher client demand, enterprise-wide initiatives, regional economic conditions and disruption in debt and equity markets leading to higher utilization. Growth in U.S. commercial loans was driven by domestic economic momentum. This was partially offset by declines in commercial real estate loans as net paydowns and sales outpaced new originations and renewals.
Reservable criticized balances, net charge-offs and nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed property balances in the commercial credit portfolio declined in
2011
. The reductions in reservable criticized and nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed property were primarily in the commercial real estate and U.S. commercial portfolios. Commercial real estate continued to show improvement during
2011
compared to
2010
in both the homebuilder and non-homebuilder portfolios. However, levels of
 
stressed commercial real estate loans remain elevated. The reduction in reservable criticized U.S. commercial loans was driven by broad-based improvements in terms of clients, industries and businesses. Most other credit indicators across the remaining commercial portfolios also improved.
Table 38
presents our commercial loans and leases, and related credit quality information at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
.
Nonperforming commercial loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans and leases were
2.02 percent
and
3.32 percent
(
2.04 percent
and
3.35 percent
excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option) at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. Accruing commercial loans and leases past due 90 days or more as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans and leases were
0.10 percent
and
0.21 percent
(
0.10 percent
and
0.22 percent
excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option) at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
.
Table 39
presents net charge-offs and related ratios for our
 
commercial loans and leases for
2011
and
2010
. Improving portfolio trends drove lower charge-offs and higher recoveries across most of the portfolio. Commercial real estate net charge-offs during
2011
declined
in both the homebuilder and non-homebuilder portfolios. U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs
declined
primarily due to improvements in delinquencies, collections and bankruptcies. U.S. commercial charge-offs
decreased
during
2011
due to broad-based declines from improvements in client profiles, industries and businesses.
Table 40
presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs, financial guarantees, bankers acceptances and commercial letters of credit for which the Corporation is legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions, during a specified period. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes. Total commercial committed credit exposure
increased
$10.4 billion
at
December 31, 2011
compared to
December 31, 2010
driven primarily by increases in loans and leases, partially offset by decreases in SBLCs, LHFS and bankers acceptances.
 
Total commercial utilized credit exposure
increased
$6.1 billion
in
2011
driven primarily by increases in loans and leases, partially offset by decreases in SBLCs, LHFS and bankers acceptances. Utilized loans and leases increased primarily due to growth and higher revolver utilization in our international franchise, and were partially offset by run-off in the commercial real estate portfolio and the transfer of securities-based lending exposures from our U.S. commercial portfolio to the consumer portfolio during 2011. The utilization rate for loans and leases, SBLCs and financial guarantees, and bankers acceptances was
57 percent
at both
December 31, 2011
and
2010
.
Table 41
presents commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure by product type. Criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories as defined by regulatory authorities. Total commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure
decreased
$15.4 billion
, or
36 percent
, in
2011
due to broad-based decreases across most portfolios, primarily in commercial real estate and U.S. commercial
 
driven largely by continued paydowns, sales and ratings upgrades outpacing downgrades. Despite the improvements, utilized reservable criticized levels remain elevated, particularly in commercial real estate and U.S. small business commercial. At
December 31, 2011
, approximately 85 percent of commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure was secured compared to 88 percent at
December 31, 2010
.
U.S. Commercial
At
December 31, 2011
, 70 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in
Global Banking,
11 percent in
CBB,
10 percent in
GWIM
(business-purpose loans for wealthy clients) and the remainder mostly in
Global
 
Markets
. U.S. commercial loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option,
increased
$4.4 billion
in
2011
due to continued growth and higher revolver utilization across the portfolio. This increase was net of a product reclassification for certain trade loans to non-U.S. commercial in 2011, as well as
the transfer of securities-based lending loans to the consumer portfolio earlier in 2011, which together totaled $5.3 billion. Reservable criticized balances and nonperforming loans and leases
declined
$5.5 billion
and
$1.3 billion
in
2011
. The declines were broad-based in terms of clients and industries and were driven by improved client credit profiles and liquidity. Net charge-offs
decreased
$686 million
in
2011
due to broad-based declines from credit quality improvements mentioned above, driving lower charge-offs and higher recoveries.
Commercial Real Estate
The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in
Global Banking
and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, homebuilders and commercial real estate firms. Outstanding loans
decreased
$9.8 billion
in
2011
due to paydowns and sales, which outpaced new originations and renewals. Over 90 percent of this decrease occurred within reservable criticized.
The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration of commercial real estate loans and leases at
20 percent
and
18 percent
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. For more information on geographic and property concentrations, see
 
Table 42
.
Credit quality for commercial real estate continued to show signs of improvement; however, we expect that elevated unemployment and ongoing pressure on vacancy and rental rates will continue to affect primarily the non-homebuilder portfolio. Nonperforming commercial real estate loans and foreclosed properties
decreased
31 percent
in
2011
, split evenly across the homebuilder and non-homebuilder portfolios. The decline in nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties in the non-homebuilder portfolio was driven by decreases in the shopping centers/retail, land and land development, and office property types. Reservable criticized balances
decreased
$9.0 billion
primarily due to declines in the office, shopping centers/retail and multi-family rental property types in the non-homebuilder portfolio and improvement in the homebuilder portfolio. Net charge-offs
declined
$1.1 billion
in
2011
due to improvement in both the homebuilder and non-homebuilder portfolio.
Table 42
presents outstanding commercial real estate loans by geographic region which is based on the geographic location of the collateral and property type. Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans and leases secured by non-owner-occupied real estate which is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment.
During
2011
, we continued to see improvement in the homebuilder portfolio. Certain portions of the non-homebuilder portfolio remain at risk as occupancy rates, rental rates and commercial property prices remain under pressure. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce utilized
 
and potential exposure in the commercial real estate portfolios including refinement of our credit standards, additional transfers of deteriorating exposures to management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of alternative resolution methods to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.
Tables
43
and
44
present commercial real estate credit quality data by non-homebuilder and homebuilder property types. The homebuilder portfolio presented in Tables
42
,
43
and
44
includes condominiums and other residential real estate. Other property
 
types in Tables
42
,
43
and
44
primarily include special purpose, nursing/retirement homes, medical facilities and restaurants, as well as unsecured loans to borrowers whose primary business is commercial real estate.
At
December 31, 2011
, total committed non-homebuilder exposure was $53.1 billion compared to $64.2 billion at
December 31, 2010
, with the decrease due to exposure reductions in all non-homebuilder property types. Non-homebuilder nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties were
$3.5 billion
and
$4.6 billion
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, which represented 9.29 percent and 10.08 percent of total non-homebuilder loans and foreclosed properties. Non-homebuilder utilized reservable criticized exposure
decreased
to
$10.1 billion
, or 25.34 percent of non-homebuilder utilized reservable exposure, at
December 31, 2011
compared to
$17.1 billion
, or 35.55 percent, at
December 31, 2010
. The decrease in reservable criticized exposure was driven primarily by office, shopping centers/retail and multi-family rental property types. For the non-homebuilder portfolio, net charge-offs
decreased
$862 million
in
2011
due in part to resolution of criticized assets through payoffs and sales.
 
At
December 31, 2011
, we had committed homebuilder exposure of $3.9 billion compared to $6.0 billion at
December 31, 2010
, of which $2.4 billion and $4.3 billion were funded secured loans. The decline in homebuilder committed exposure was due to repayments, net charge-offs, reductions in new home construction and continued risk mitigation initiatives with market conditions providing fewer origination opportunities to offset the reductions. Homebuilder nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties
decreased
$970 million
due to repayments, a decline in the volume of loans being downgraded to nonaccrual status and net charge-offs. Homebuilder utilized reservable criticized exposure
decreased
$2.0 billion
to
$1.4 billion
due to repayments and net charge-offs. The nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties and the utilized reservable criticized ratios for the homebuilder portfolio were 38.89 percent and 54.65 percent at
December 31, 2011
compared to 42.80 percent and 74.27 percent at
December 31, 2010
. Net charge-offs for the homebuilder portfolio
decreased
$208 million
in
2011
.
At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, the commercial real estate loan portfolio included $10.9 billion and $19.1 billion of construction and land development loans that were originated to fund the construction and/or rehabilitation of commercial properties. The decline in construction and land development loans was driven by repayments, net charge-offs and continued risk mitigation initiatives which outpaced new originations. This portfolio is mostly secured and diversified across property types and geographic regions but faces continuing challenges in the housing and rental markets. Weak rental demand and cash flows along with depressed property valuations of land have contributed to elevated levels of reservable criticized exposure, nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties,
and net charge-offs. Reservable criticized construction and land development loans totaled $4.9 billion and $10.5 billion, and nonperforming construction and land development loans and foreclosed properties totaled $2.1 billion and $4.0 billion at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. During a propertys construction phase, interest income is typically paid from interest reserves that are established at the inception of the loan. As construction is completed and the property is put into service, these interest reserves are depleted and interest payments from operating cash flows begin. Loans continue to be classified as construction loans until they are refinanced. We do not recognize interest income on nonperforming loans regardless of the existence of an interest reserve.
Non-U.S. Commercial
The non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio is managed primarily in
Global Banking
. Outstanding loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option,
increased
$23.4 billion
in
2011
from continued growth in corporate loans and trade finance due to client demand, enterprise-wide initiatives, regional economic conditions and disruption in debt and equity markets, along with the product reclassification from U.S. commercial in 2011. For additional information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see
Non-U.S. Portfolio
on page
81
.
 
U.S. Small Business Commercial
The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of business card and small business loans managed in
CBB
. U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs
declined
$923 million
in
2011
driven by improvements in delinquencies, collections and bankruptcies resulting from an improved economic environment as well as the reduction of higher risk vintages and the impact of higher credit quality originations. Of the U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs, 74 percent were credit card-related products for
2011
compared to 79 percent for
2010
.
Commercial Loans Carried at Fair Value
The portfolio of commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option is managed primarily in
Global Banking
. Outstanding commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option
increased
$3.3 billion
to an aggregate fair value of
$6.6 billion
at
December 31, 2011
due primarily to increased corporate borrowings under bank credit facilities. We recorded net losses of $174 million resulting from changes in the fair value of the loan portfolio during
2011
compared to net gains of
$82 million
in
2010
. These amounts were primarily attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were recorded in other income (loss) and do not reflect the results of hedging activities.
In addition, unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit accounted for under the fair value option had an aggregate fair value of
$1.2 billion
and
$866 million
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
which was recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The associated aggregate notional amount of unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit accounted for under the fair value option was
$25.7 billion
and
$27.3 billion
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. During
2011
we recorded net losses of
$429 million
from changes in the fair value of commitments and letters of credit compared to net gains of
$23 million
in
2010
. These amounts were primarily attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were recorded in other income (loss) and do not reflect the results of hedging activities.
Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity
Table 45
presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during
2011
and
2010
. Nonperforming commercial loans and leases
decreased
$3.5 billion
during
2011
to
$6.3 billion
at
December 31, 2011
driven by paydowns, charge-offs, returns to performing status and sales, partially offset by new nonaccrual loans in the commercial real
 
estate and U.S. commercial portfolios. Approximately 96 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties are secured and approximately 51 percent are contractually current. In addition, commercial nonperforming loans are carried at approximately 68 percent of their unpaid principal balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease losses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated property value less estimated costs to sell.
As a result of the retrospective application of new accounting guidance on TDRs effective September 30, 2011, the Corporation classified
$1.1 billion
of commercial loan modifications as TDRs that in previous periods had not been classified as TDRs. These loans were newly identified as TDRs typically because the Corporation was not able to demonstrate that the modified rate of interest, although significantly higher than the rate prior to
 
modification, was a market rate of interest. These newly identified TDRs did not have a significant impact on the allowance for credit losses or the provision for credit losses. Included in this amount was
$402 million
of performing commercial loans at
December 31, 2011
that were not previously considered to be impaired loans. For additional information, see
Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Principles
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
Table 46
presents our commercial TDRs by product type and status. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated business card loans and are not classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due.
Industry Concentrations
Table 47
presents commercial committed and utilized credit exposure by industry and the total net credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portions of certain credit exposures. Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. The
increase
in commercial committed exposure of
$10.4 billion
in
2011
was concentrated in banks, diversified financials and energy, partially offset by lower real estate, insurance (including monolines) and other committed exposure.
Industry limits are used internally to manage industry concentrations and are based on committed exposures and capital usage that are allocated on an industry-by-industry basis. A risk management framework is in place to set and approve industry limits as well as to provide ongoing monitoring. Managements Credit Risk Committee (CRC) oversees industry limit governance.
Diversified financials, our largest industry concentration, experienced an
increase
in committed exposure of
$8.2 billion
, or
nine percent
, in
2011
driven primarily by increases in consumer finance lending and traded products exposure.
Real estate, our second largest industry concentration, experienced a
decrease
in committed exposure of
$9.4 billion
, or
13 percent
, in
2011
due primarily to paydowns and sales which outpaced new originations and renewals. Real estate construction and land development exposure represented 20 percent and 27 percent of the total real estate industry committed exposure at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see
Commercial Real Estate
on page
74
.
Committed exposure in the banking industry
increase
d
$9.1 billion
, or
31 percent
, in
2011
primarily due to increases in trade finance as a result of momentum from regional economies and growth initiatives in foreign markets.
Energy committed exposure increased $5.7 billion, or 22 percent, in
2011
due to increases in working capital lines for state-related enterprises and increases in large investment-grade energy companies.
Insurance, including monolines committed exposure,
decreased
$8.3 billion
, or
34 percent
, in
2011
due primarily to the settlement/termination of monoline positions. For more information on our monoline exposure, see
Monoline and Related Exposure
below.
Other committed exposure
decreased
$6.0 billion
, or
44
 
percent
, in
2011
due to reductions primarily in traded products exposure.
The Corporations committed state and municipal exposure of $46.1 billion at
December 31, 2011
consisted of $34.4 billion of commercial utilized exposure (including $18.6 billion of funded loans, $11.3 billion of SBLCs and $4.1 billion of derivative assets) and unutilized commercial exposure of $11.7 billion (primarily unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit) and is reported in the Government and public education industry in
Table 47
. Economic conditions continue to impact debt issued by state and local municipalities and certain exposures to these municipalities. While historical default rates have been low, as part of our overall and ongoing risk management processes, we continually monitor these exposures through a rigorous review process. Additionally, internal communications surrounding certain at-risk counterparties and/or sectors are regularly circulated ensuring exposure levels are in compliance with established concentration guidelines.
Monoline and Related Exposure
Monoline exposure is reported in the insurance industry and managed under insurance portfolio industry limits.
We have indirect exposure to monolines primarily in the form of guarantees supporting our loans, investment portfolios, securitizations and credit-enhanced securities as part of our public finance business and other selected products. Such indirect exposure exists when we purchase credit protection from monolines to hedge all or a portion of the credit risk on certain credit exposures including loans and CDOs. We underwrite our public finance exposure by evaluating the underlying securities.
We also have indirect exposure to monolines in the form of guarantees supporting our mortgage and other loan sales. Indirect exposure may exist when credit protection was purchased from monolines to hedge all or a portion of the credit risk on certain mortgage and other loan exposures. A loss may occur when we are required to repurchase a loan and the market value of the loan has declined, or we are required to indemnify or provide recourse for a guarantors loss.

.
During
2011
, we terminated all of our monoline contracts referencing super senior ABS CDOs and reclassified net monoline exposure with a carrying value of
$1.3 billion
(
$4.7 billion
gross receivable less impairment) at
December 31, 2011
from derivative assets to other assets because of the inherent default risk. Because these contracts no longer provide a hedge benefit, they are no longer considered derivative trading instruments. This exposure relates to a single counterparty and is recorded at fair value based on current net recovery projections. The net recovery projections take into account the present value of projected payments expected to be received from the counterparty.
Monoline derivative credit exposure had a notional value of
$21.1 billion
and
$38.4 billion
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. Mark-to-market monoline derivative credit exposure was
$1.8 billion
and
$9.2 billion
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
with the decrease driven by positive valuation adjustments on legacy assets, terminated monoline contracts and the reclassification of net monoline exposure to other assets mentioned above. The counterparty credit valuation adjustment related to monoline derivative exposure was
$417 million
and
$5.3 billion
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. This adjustment reduced our net
 
mark-to-market exposure to
$1.3 billion
at
December 31, 2011
compared to
$3.9 billion
at
December 31, 2010
and covered
24 percent
of the mark-to-market exposure at
December 31, 2011
, down from
57 percent
at
December 31, 2010
. We do not hold collateral against these derivative exposures. For more information on our monoline exposure, termination of certain monoline contracts and the transfer of monoline exposure to other assets, see
Global Markets
on page
26
.
We also have indirect exposure to monolines as we invest in securities where the issuers have purchased wraps. For example, municipalities and corporations purchase insurance in order to reduce their cost of borrowing. If the rating agencies downgrade the monolines, the credit rating of the bond may fall and may have an adverse impact on the market value of the security. In the case of default, we first look to the underlying securities and then to the purchased insurance for recovery. Investments in securities with purchased wraps issued by municipalities and corporations had a notional amount of $150 million and $2.4 billion at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. Mark-to-market investment exposure was $89 million at
December 31, 2011
compared to $2.2 billion at
December 31, 2010
.
Risk Mitigation
We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, credit exposure may be added within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection.
At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was
$19.4 billion
and
$20.1 billion
. The mark-to-market effects, including the cost of net credit default protection hedging our credit exposure, resulted in net gains of $121 million in
2011
compared to net losses of $546 million in
2010
.
 
The average VaR for these credit derivative hedges was $60 million in
2011
compared to $53 million in
2010
. The average VaR for the related credit exposure was $74 million in
2011
compared to $65 million in
2010
. There is a diversification effect between the net credit default protection hedging our credit exposure and the related credit exposure such that the combined average VaR was $38 million in
2011
compared to $41 million in
2010
. See
Trading Risk Management
on page
90
for a description of our VaR calculation for the market-based trading portfolio.
Tables
48
and
49
present the maturity profiles and the credit exposure debt ratings of the net credit default protection portfolio at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. The distribution of debt ratings for net notional credit default protection purchased is shown as a negative amount.
In addition to our net notional credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients and establishing positions intended to profit from directional or relative value changes. We execute the majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market with large, multinational financial institutions, including broker/dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other investors. Because these transactions are executed in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the terms of these contracts. In most cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a
 
credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required of the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades.
Table 50
presents the total contract/notional amount of credit derivatives outstanding and includes both purchased and written credit derivatives. The credit risk amounts are measured as the net replacement cost in the event the counterparties with contracts in a gain position to us fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. For information on our written credit derivatives, see
Note 4  Derivatives
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
The credit risk amounts discussed above and presented in
Table 50
take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements, while amounts disclosed in
Note 4  Derivatives
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
are shown
 
on a gross basis. Credit risk reflects the potential benefit from offsetting exposure to non-credit derivative products with the same counterparties that may be netted upon the occurrence of certain events, thereby reducing our overall exposure.
n/a = not applicable
Counterparty Credit Risk Valuation Adjustments
We record a counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment on certain derivative assets, including our credit default protection purchased, in order to properly reflect the credit quality of the counterparty. These adjustments are necessary as the market quotes on derivatives do not fully reflect the credit risk of the counterparties to the derivative assets. We consider collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate our credit exposure to each counterparty in determining the counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment. All or a portion of these counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments are subsequently adjusted due to changes in the value of the derivative contract, collateral and creditworthiness of the counterparty.
During
2011
and
2010
, credit valuation gains (losses) of
$(1.9) billion
and
$731 million
(
$(606) million
and
$(8) million
, net of hedges) for counterparty credit risk were recognized in trading account profits for counterparty credit risk related to derivative assets. For information on our monoline counterparty credit risk, see

Non-U.S. Portfolio
Our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. Management oversight of country risk, including cross-border risk, is provided by the Regional Risk
 
Committee, a subcommittee of the CRC.
Table 51
sets forth total non-U.S. exposure broken out by region at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. Non-U.S. exposure includes credit exposure net of local liabilities, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the U.S. Total non-U.S. exposure can be adjusted for externally guaranteed loans outstanding and certain collateral types. Exposures which are subject to external guarantees are reported under the country of the guarantor. Exposures with tangible collateral are reflected in the country where the collateral is held. For securities received, other than cross-border resale agreements, outstandings are assigned to the domicile of the issuer of the securities. Resale agreements are generally presented based on the domicile of the counterparty consistent with FFIEC reporting requirements.
Our total non-U.S. exposure was
$232.6 billion
at
December 31, 2011
, a
decrease
of
$29.4 billion
from
December 31, 2010
. Our non-U.S. exposure remained concentrated in Europe which accounted for
$115.9 billion
, or
50 percent
, of total non-U.S. exposure. The European exposure was mostly in Western Europe and was distributed across a variety of industries. The
decrease
of
$32.2 billion
in Europe was primarily driven by our efforts to reduce risk in countries affected by the ongoing debt crisis in the Eurozone. Select European countries are further detailed in Table
54
. Asia Pacific was our second largest non-U.S. exposure at
$74.6 billion
, or
32 percent
. The
$1.3 billion
increase
in Asia Pacific was driven by increases in securities and local exposure in Japan and increases in the emerging markets, predominately in local exposure, loans and securities offset by the sale of CCB shares. For more information on our CCB investment, see
Note 5  Securities
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
. Latin America accounted for
$17.4 billion
, or
seven percent
, of total non-U.S. exposure. The
$2.6 billion
increase
in Latin America was primarily driven by an increase in Brazil in securities and local country exposure. Middle East and Africa
increased
$926 million
to
$4.6 billion
, representing
two percent
of total non-U.S. exposure. Other non-U.S. exposure was
$20.1 billion
at
December 31, 2011
,
 
a
decrease
of
$2.1 billion
in
2011
resulting primarily from a decrease in local exposure as a result of the sale of our Canadian consumer card business. For more information on our Asia Pacific and Latin America exposure, see non-U.S. exposure to selected countries defined as emerging markets on page
83
.
Table 52
presents countries where total cross-border exposure exceeded one percent of our total assets. At
December 31, 2011
, the United Kingdom and Japan were the only countries where total cross-border exposure exceeded one percent of our total assets. At
December 31, 2011
, Canada and France had total cross-border exposure of
$16.9 billion
and
$16.1 billion
representing
0.79 percent
and
0.75 percent
of total assets. Canada and France were the only other countries that had total cross-border exposure that exceeded
0.75 percent
of our total assets at
December 31, 2011
.
Exposure includes cross-border claims by our non-U.S. offices including loans, acceptances, time deposits placed, trading account assets, securities, derivative assets, other interest-earning investments and other monetary assets. Amounts also include unused commitments, SBLCs, commercial letters of credit and formal guarantees. Sector definitions are consistent with FFIEC reporting requirements for preparing the Country Exposure Report.
As presented in
Table 53
, non-U.S. exposure to borrowers or counterparties in emerging markets
decreased
$3.4 billion
to
$61.6 billion
at
December 31, 2011
. The
decrease
was due to the sale of CCB shares, partially offset by growth in the rest of
 
Asia Pacific and other regions. Non-U.S. exposure to borrowers or counterparties in emerging markets represented
26 percent
and
25 percent
of total non-U.S. exposure at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
.
At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
,
60 percent
and
70 percent
of our emerging markets exposure was in Asia Pacific. Emerging markets exposure in Asia Pacific
decreased
by
$8.5 billion
driven by a
$19.0 billion
decrease related to the sale of CCB shares, partially offset by increases in loans and securities predominately in India, China (excluding CCB) and South Korea.
At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
,
26 percent
and
21 percent
of our emerging markets exposure was in Latin America. Latin America emerging markets exposure
increased
$2.5 billion
driven by increases in securities and local exposure in Brazil.
At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
,
eight percent
and
six percent
of our emerging markets exposure was in Middle East and Africa, with an
increase
of
$926 million
primarily driven by increases in loans and derivatives in United Arab Emirates, and by increases in loans in Other Middle East and Africa. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
,
six percent
and
three percent
of the emerging markets exposure was in Central and Eastern Europe, with the increase driven by an increase in loans in the Russian Federation.
Certain European countries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, have experienced varying degrees of financial stress. Risks from the continued debt crisis in Europe could continue to disrupt the financial markets which could have a detrimental impact on global economic conditions and sovereign and non-sovereign debt in these countries. Uncertainty in the progress of debt restructuring negotiations and the lack of a clear resolution to the crisis have led to continued volatility in European financial markets, as well as global financial markets. In December 2011, the ECB announced initiatives to address European bank liquidity and funding concerns by providing low-cost, three-year loans to banks, and expanding collateral eligibility. In early 2012, S&P, Fitch and Moodys downgraded the credit ratings of several European countries, and S&P downgraded the credit rating of the EFSF, adding to concerns about investor appetite for continued support in stabilizing the affected countries.
Table 54
shows our direct sovereign and non-sovereign exposures, excluding consumer credit card exposure, in these countries at
December 31, 2011
. Our total sovereign and non-sovereign exposure to these countries was
$15.3 billion
at December 31, 2011 compared to $16.6 billion at December 31, 2010. The total exposure to these countries, net of hedges, was
$10.5 billion
at
December 31, 2011
compared to
$12.4 billion
at
 
December 31, 2010
, of which
$252 million
and
$91 million
was total sovereign exposure. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the fair value of net credit default protection purchased was
$4.9 billion
and $4.2 billion.
We hedge certain of our selected European country exposure with credit default protection in the form of CDS. The majority of our CDS contracts are with highly-rated financial institutions primarily outside of the Eurozone and we work to limit or eliminate correlated CDS. Due to our engagement in market-making activities, our CDS portfolio contains contracts with various maturities to a diverse set of counterparties.
In addition to our direct sovereign and non-sovereign exposures, a significant deterioration of the European debt crisis could result in material reductions in the value of sovereign debt and other asset classes, disruptions in capital markets, widening of credit spreads, loss of investor confidence in the financial services industry, a slowdown in global economic activity and other adverse developments. For additional information on the debt crisis in Europe, see
Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K
.
Losses could still result even if there is credit default protection purchased because the purchased credit protection contracts only pay out under certain scenarios and thus not all losses may be covered by the credit protection contracts. The effectiveness of our CDS protection as a hedge of these risks is influenced by a number of factors, including the contractual terms of the CDS. Generally, only the occurrence of a credit event as defined by the CDS terms (which may include, among other events, the failure to pay by, or restructuring of, the reference entity) results in a payment under the purchased credit protection contracts. The determination as to whether a credit event has occurred is made by the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) Determination Committee (comprised of various ISDA member firms) based on the terms of the CDS and facts and circumstances for the event. Accordingly, uncertainties exist as to whether any particular strategy or policy action for addressing European debt crisis would constitute a credit event under the CDS. A voluntary restructuring may not trigger a credit event under CDS terms and consequently may not trigger a payment under the CDS contract.
Provision for Credit Losses
The provision for credit losses
decreased
$15.0 billion
to
$13.4 billion
for
2011
compared to
2010
. The provision for credit losses was $7.4 billion lower than net charge-offs for
2011
, resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses driven primarily by lower delinquencies, improved collection rates and fewer bankruptcy filings across the U.S. credit card and unsecured consumer lending portfolios in
CBB
, and improvement in overall credit quality in the commercial real estate portfolio partially offset by additions to consumer PCI loan portfolio reserves. This compared to a $5.9 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses in
2010
.
The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio decreased $11.1 billion to $14.3 billion for
2011
compared to
2010
reflecting improving economic conditions and improvement in the current and projected levels of delinquencies, collections and bankruptcies in the U.S. consumer credit card and unsecured consumer lending portfolios. Also contributing to the decrease
 
were lower credit costs in the non-PCI home equity loan portfolio due to improving portfolio trends, partially offset by higher credit costs in the residential mortgage portfolio primarily reflecting further deterioration in home prices. For the consumer PCI loan portfolios, updates to our expected cash flows resulted in an increase in reserves of $2.2 billion in
2011
due primarily to our updated home price outlook. Reserve increases related to the consumer PCI loan portfolios in 2010 were also $2.2 billion.
The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including the provision for unfunded lending commitments, decreased $3.9 billion to a benefit of $915 million in
2011
compared to
2010
due to continued economic improvement and the resulting impact on property values in the commercial real estate portfolio, lower current and projected levels of delinquencies and bankruptcies in the U.S. small business commercial portfolio and improvement in borrower credit profiles across the remainder of the commercial portfolio.
Allowance for Credit Losses
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses
The allowance for loan and lease losses is comprised of two components, as described below. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the total of these two components. The allowance for loan and lease losses excludes LHFS and loans accounted for under the fair value option as the fair value reflects a credit risk component.
The first component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers nonperforming commercial loans and performing commercial loans that have been modified in a TDR, consumer real estate loans that have been modified in a TDR, renegotiated credit card, and renegotiated unsecured consumer and small business loans. These loans are subject to impairment measurement based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate, or in certain circumstances, impairment may also be based upon the collateral value or the loans observable market price if available. Impairment measurement for the renegotiated credit card, unsecured consumer and small business TDR portfolios is based on the present value of projected cash flows discounted using the average portfolio contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring and prior to any risk-based or penalty-based increase in rate on the restructured loans. For purposes of computing this specific loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical loss experience for the respective product types and risk ratings of the loans.
The second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers the remaining consumer and commercial loans and leases that have incurred losses but are not yet individually identifiable. The allowance for consumer and certain homogeneous commercial loan and lease products is based on aggregated portfolio evaluations, generally by product type. Loss forecast models are utilized that consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, economic trends and credit scores. Our consumer real estate loss forecast model estimates the portion of loans that will default based on individual loan attributes, the most significant of which are refreshed LTV or CLTV, and borrower credit score as well as vintage and geography, all of which are further broken down into current delinquency status. Incorporating refreshed LTV and CLTV into our probability of default allows us to factor the impact of changes in home prices into our allowance for loan and lease losses. These loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis to incorporate information reflecting the current economic environment. As of
December 31, 2011
, the loss forecast process resulted in reductions in the allowance for most consumer portfolios, particularly the credit card and direct/indirect portfolios.
The allowance for commercial loan and lease losses is established by product type after analyzing historical loss experience by internal risk rating, current economic conditions, industry performance trends, geographic and obligor concentrations within each portfolio and any other pertinent information. The statistical models for commercial loans are generally updated annually and utilize our historical database of actual defaults and other data. The loan risk ratings and composition of the commercial portfolios are updated at least
 
quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflecting the current economic environment. For risk-rated commercial loans, we estimate the probability of default and the LGD based on our historical experience of defaults and credit losses. Factors considered when assessing the internal risk rating include the value of the underlying collateral, if applicable, the industry in which the obligor operates, the obligors liquidity and other financial indicators, and other quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the obligors credit risk. When estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses, management relies not only on models derived from historical experience but also on its judgment in considering the effect on probable losses inherent in the portfolios due to the current macroeconomic environment and trends, inherent uncertainty in models and other qualitative factors. As of
December 31, 2011
, updates to the loan risk ratings and portfolio composition resulted in reductions in the allowance for all commercial portfolios.
Also included within this second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses and determined separately from the procedures outlined above are reserves that are maintained to cover uncertainties that affect our estimate of probable losses including domestic and global economic uncertainty, large single name defaults, significant events which could disrupt financial markets and model imprecision.
We monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred loan and lease losses. This monitoring process includes periodic assessments by senior management of loan and lease portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred losses in those portfolios.
Additions to, or reductions of, the allowance for loan and lease losses generally are recorded through charges or credits to the provision for credit losses. Credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses.
The allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio as presented in
Table 56
was
$29.6 billion
at
December 31, 2011
, a
decrease
of
$5.1 billion
from
December 31, 2010
. This
decrease
was primarily due to improving economic conditions and improvement in the current and projected levels of delinquencies, collections and bankruptcies in the U.S. consumer credit card and unsecured consumer lending portfolios. With respect to the consumer PCI loan portfolios, updates to our expected cash flows resulted in an increase in reserves through provision of $2.2 billion in
2011
, within the discontinued real estate, home equity and residential mortgage portfolios, primarily due to our updated home price outlook. Reserve increases related to the consumer PCI loan portfolios in
2010
were also $2.2 billion.
The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio was
$4.1 billion
at
December 31, 2011
, a
$3.0 billion
decrease
from
December 31, 2010
. The
decrease
was driven by improvement in the economy and the resulting impact on property values in the commercial real estate portfolio, improvement in projected delinquencies in the U.S. small business commercial portfolio, mostly within
CBB
, and stronger borrower credit profiles in the U.S. commercial portfolios, primarily in
Global Banking.
The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was
3.68 percent
at
December 31, 2011
compared to
4.47 percent
at
December 31, 2010
. The
decrease
in the ratio was largely due to improved credit quality and economic conditions which led to the reduction in the allowance for credit losses discussed above. The
December 31,
2011 and 2010
ratios above include the PCI loan portfolio. Excluding the PCI loan portfolio, the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was
2.86 percent
at
December 31, 2011
compared to
3.94 percent
at
December 31, 2010
.
Absent unexpected deterioration in the economy, we expect
 
reductions in the allowance for loan and lease losses to continue in
2012
. However, in both consumer and commercial portfolios, we expect these reductions to be less than those in
2011
and
2010
.
Table 55
presents a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses for
2011
and
2010
.
For reporting purposes, we allocate the allowance for credit losses across products. However, the allowance is available to absorb any credit losses without restriction.
Table 56
presents our allocation by product type.
Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments
In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. Unfunded lending commitments are subject to the same assessment as funded loans, including estimates of probability of default and LGD. Due to the nature of unfunded commitments, the estimate of probable losses must also consider utilization. To estimate the portion of these undrawn commitments that is likely to be drawn by a borrower at the time of estimated default, analyses of the Corporations historical experience are applied to the unfunded commitments to estimate the funded EAD. The expected loss for unfunded lending commitments is the product of the probability of default, the LGD and the EAD, adjusted for any qualitative factors including economic uncertainty and inherent imprecision in models.
The reserve for unfunded lending commitments at
December 31, 2011
was
$714 million
,
$474 million
lower
than
December 31, 2010
driven by accretion of purchase accounting adjustments on acquired Merrill Lynch unfunded positions and improved credit quality in the unfunded portfolio.
Market Risk Management
Market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and/or activities including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, trading account assets and liabilities, and derivatives. Market-sensitive assets and liabilities are generated through loans and deposits associated with our traditional banking business, customer and other trading operations, the ALM process, credit risk mitigation activities and mortgage banking activities. In the event of market volatility, factors such as underlying market movements and liquidity have an impact on the results of the Corporation.
Our traditional banking loan and deposit products are nontrading positions and are generally reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities (historical cost). However, these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions, primarily changes in the levels of interest rates. The risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our nontrading positions is managed through our ALM activities. We have elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option. For further information on the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, see
Note 22  Fair Value Measurements
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
Our trading positions are reported at fair value with changes currently reflected in income. Trading positions are subject to various risk factors, which include exposures to interest rates and foreign exchange rates, as well as mortgage, equity, commodity, issuer, credit and market liquidity risk factors. We seek to mitigate these risk exposures by using techniques that encompass a variety of financial instruments in both the cash and derivatives markets. The following discusses the key risk components along with respective risk mitigation techniques.
 
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. These instruments include, but are not limited to, loans, debt securities, certain trading-related assets and liabilities, deposits, borrowings and derivatives. Hedging instruments used to mitigate these risks include derivatives such as options, futures, forwards and swaps.
Foreign Exchange Risk
Foreign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, foreign currency-denominated loans and securities, future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions, foreign currency-denominated debt and various foreign exchange derivatives whose values fluctuate with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or non-U.S. interest rates. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options, currency swaps, futures, forwards, foreign currency-denominated debt and deposits.
Mortgage Risk
Mortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the value of mortgage-related instruments. The values of these instruments are sensitive to prepayment rates, mortgage rates, agency debt ratings, default, market liquidity, government participation and interest rate volatility. Our exposure to these instruments takes several forms. First, we trade and engage in market-making activities in a variety of mortgage securities including whole loans, pass-through certificates, commercial mortgages and collateralized mortgage obligations including CDOs using mortgages as underlying collateral. Second, we originate a variety of MBS which involves the accumulation of mortgage-related loans in anticipation of eventual securitization. Third, we may hold positions in mortgage securities and residential mortgage loans as part of the ALM portfolio. Fourth, we create MSRs as part of our mortgage origination activities. See
Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Principles
and
Note 25  Mortgage Servicing Rights
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information on MSRs. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options, currency swaps, futures, forwards and foreign currency-denominated debt.
Equity Market Risk
Equity market risk represents exposures to securities that represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of domestic and foreign common stock or other equity-linked instruments. Instruments that would lead to this exposure include, but are not limited to, the following: common stock, exchange-traded funds, American Depositary Receipts, convertible bonds, listed equity options (puts and calls), OTC equity options, equity total return swaps, equity index futures and other equity derivative products. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures, swaps, convertible bonds and cash positions.
Commodity Risk
Commodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in the petroleum, natural gas, power and metals markets. These instruments consist primarily of futures, forwards, swaps and options. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity product, as well as cash positions.
Issuer Credit Risk
Issuer credit risk represents exposures to changes in the creditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers. Our portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an asset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of credit spreads, by credit migration or by defaults. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds, CDS and other credit fixed-income instruments.
Market Liquidity Risk
Market liquidity risk represents the risk that the level of expected market activity changes dramatically and, in certain cases, may even cease. This exposes us to the risk that we will not be able to transact business and execute trades in an orderly manner which may impact our results. This impact could further be exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing correlations are compromised by disproportionate demand or lack of demand for certain instruments. We utilize various risk mitigating techniques as discussed in more detail in Trading Risk Management.
 
Trading Risk Management
Trading-related revenues represent the amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading account assets and liabilities and derivative positions are reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see
Note 22  Fair Value Measurements
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
. Trading-related revenues can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, trading-related revenues are dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment.
The Global Markets Risk Committee (GRC), chaired by the Global Markets Risk Executive, has been designated by ALMRC as the primary governance authority for global markets risk management including trading risk management. The GRCs focus is to take a forward-looking view of the primary credit and market risks impacting
Global Markets
and prioritize those that need a proactive risk mitigation strategy. Market risks that impact businesses outside of
Global Markets
are monitored and governed by their respective governance authorities.
The GRC monitors significant daily revenues and losses by business and the primary drivers of the revenues or losses. Thresholds are in place for each of our businesses in order to determine if the revenue or loss is considered to be significant for that business. If any of the thresholds are exceeded, an explanation of the variance is provided to the GRC. The thresholds are developed in coordination with the respective risk managers to highlight those revenues or losses that exceed what is considered to be normal daily income statement volatility.
The histogram below is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for
2011
and
2010
. During
2011
, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 86 percent (214 days) of the trading days of which 66 percent (165 days) were daily trading gains of over $25 million, five percent (12 days) of the trading days had losses greater than
 
$25 million and the largest loss was $119 million. This is compared to
2010
, where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 90 percent (225 days) of the trading days of which 75 percent (187 days) were daily trading gains of over $25 million, four percent (nine days) of the trading days had losses greater than $25 million and the largest loss was $102 million.
To evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of individual positions as well as portfolios. VaR is a key statistic used to measure market risk. In order to manage day-to-day risks, VaR is subject to trading limits both for our overall trading portfolio and within individual businesses. All limit excesses are communicated to management for review.
A VaR model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the worst loss the portfolio is expected to experience based on historical trends with a given level of confidence and depends on the volatility of the positions in the portfolio and on how strongly their risks are correlated. Within any VaR model, there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company. In addition, the accuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the positions in the portfolio. A VaR model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products that do not have extensive historical price data or for illiquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available.
 
A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios. There are, however, many limitations inherent in a VaR model as it utilizes historical results over a defined time period to estimate future performance. Historical results may not always be indicative of future results and changes in market conditions or in the composition of the underlying portfolio could have a material impact on the accuracy of the VaR model. In order for the VaR model to reflect current market conditions, we update the historical data underlying our VaR model on a bi-weekly basis and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model. Our VaR model utilizes three years of historical data. This time period was chosen to ensure that the VaR reflects both a broad range of market movements as well as being sensitive to recent changes in market volatility.
We continually review, evaluate and enhance our VaR model so that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio. Nevertheless, due to the limitations previously discussed, we have historically used the VaR model as only one of the components in managing our trading risk and also use other techniques such as stress testing and desk level limits. Periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying degrees.
The accuracy of the VaR methodology is reviewed by backtesting, which involves comparing actual results against expectations derived from historical data, the VaR results against the daily profit and loss. Graphic representation of the backtesting results with additional explanation of backtesting excesses are reported to the GRC. Backtesting excesses occur when trading losses exceed VaR. Senior management reviews and evaluates the results of these tests. In periods of market stress, the GRC members communicate daily to discuss losses and VaR limit excesses. As a result of this process, the businesses may selectively reduce risk. Where economically feasible, positions are sold or macroeconomic hedges are executed to reduce the exposure.
 
Our VaR model uses a historical simulation approach based on three years of historical data and an expected shortfall methodology equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level. Statistically, this means that losses will exceed VaR, on average, one out of 100 trading days, or two to three times each year. The number of actual backtesting excesses observed is dependent on current market performance relative to historic market volatility. For most of
2011
, the three years of historical market data utilized for VaR included the volatile fourth quarter of 2008. Subsequent market volatility has generally been lower, and as a result, the size of the largest trading losses experienced since then has been lower than would be expected based on the VaR measure. Actual losses did not exceed daily trading VaR in
2011
or
2010
. The graph below shows daily trading-related revenue and VaR for
2011
.
Table 57
presents average, high and low daily trading VaR for
2011
and
2010
.
The
$35 million
decrease in average VaR during
2011
was primarily due to a reduction in risk during the year. This was driven primarily by a decrease in credit exposures where average VaR decreased
$62 million
compared to
2010
. In addition, for
2010
 
and
2011
, data from the more volatile periods of 2007 and 2008 were no longer included in our three-year historical dataset. These impacts were partially offset by a reduction in portfolio diversification VaR of
$37 million
.
Counterparty credit risk is an adjustment to the mark-to-market value of our derivative exposures to reflect the impact of the credit quality of counterparties on our derivative assets. Since counterparty credit exposure is not included in the VaR component of the regulatory capital allocation, we do not include it in our trading VaR, and it is therefore not included in the daily trading-related revenue illustrated in our histogram or used for backtesting.
Trading Portfolio Stress Testing
Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates, and is dependent on a limited lookback window, we also stress test our portfolio. Stress testing estimates the value change in our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. Various scenarios, categorized as either historical or hypothetical, are regularly run and reported for the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses. Historical scenarios simulate the impact of price changes that occurred during a set of extended historical market events. Generally, a 10-business-day window or longer, representing the most severe point during a crisis, is selected for each historical scenario. Hypothetical scenarios provide simulations of anticipated shocks from pre-defined market stress events. These stress events include shocks to underlying market risk variables which may be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate VaR. As with the historical scenarios, the hypothetical scenarios are designed to represent a short-term market disruption. Scenarios are reviewed and updated as necessary in light of changing positions and new economic or political information. In addition to the value afforded by the results themselves, this information provides senior management with a clear picture of the trend of risk being taken given the relatively static nature of the shocks applied. Stress testing for the trading portfolio is also integrated with enterprise-wide stress testing and incorporated into the limits framework. A process is in place to promote consistency between the scenarios used for the trading portfolio and those used for enterprise-wide stress testing. The scenarios used for enterprise-wide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are forecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital and liquidity planning. For additional information on enterprise-wide stress testing, see page

.
Interest Rate Risk Management for Nontrading Activities
Interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our nontrading balance sheet. Interest rate risk is measured as the potential volatility in our core net interest income caused by changes in market interest rates. Client-facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet.
We prepare forward-looking forecasts of core net interest income. The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by the market-based forward curve. We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The core net interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing
 
assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, market conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually monitor our balance sheet position in order to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes.
The interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing and maturity characteristics, but do not include the impact of hedge ineffectiveness. The prepayment impact on amortization is reflected in the period in which a prepayment is forecasted to occur. Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not adversely affect core net interest income and capital.
Periodically, we evaluate the scenarios presented to ensure that they provide a comprehensive view of the Corporations interest rate risk exposure and are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. Given the low level of short-end rates, we have determined that gradual downward shifts of 50 bps applied to the short-end of the market-based forward curve provide a more realistic view of potential exposure resulting from changes in interest rates. This replaced the 100 bps downward shift scenarios applied to the short-end of the market-based forward curve previously presented. In addition, a long-end flattener of (50) bps was added for comparability purposes.
The spot and 12-month forward monthly rates used in our baseline forecast at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
are presented in
Table 58
.
Table 59
shows the pre-tax dollar impact to forecasted core net interest income over the next twelve months from
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, resulting from a gradual parallel increase and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. For further discussion of core net interest income, see page 
15
.
The sensitivity analysis in
Table 59
assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shifts over the indicated periods. Our core net interest income was asset sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates at both
December 31, 2011 and 2010
. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. The significant decline in long-end rates contributed to the increase in asset sensitivity between
2011
and
2010
.
Securities
The securities portfolio is an integral part of our ALM position and is primarily comprised of debt securities including MBS and to a lesser extent U.S. Treasury, corporate, municipal and other debt securities. At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, we held AFS debt securities of
$276.2 billion
and
$337.6 billion
. During
2011
and
2010
, we purchased AFS debt securities of
$99.5 billion
and
$199.2 billion
, sold
$116.8 billion
and
$97.5 billion
, and had maturities and received paydowns of
$56.7 billion
and
$70.9 billion
. We realized
$3.4 billion
and
$2.5 billion
in net gains on sales of debt securities during
2011
and
2010
. We securitized no mortgage loans into MBS during
2011
compared to
$2.4 billion
in
2010
, which we retained.
During
2011
, we purchased approximately
$35.6 billion
of U.S. agency MBS which are classified as held-to-maturity securities. The purchases of these securities are part of our long-term investment activities which include holding these securities to maturity. The classification of these securities as held-to-maturity also mitigates accumulated OCI volatility and possible negative impacts on our regulatory capital requirements under the Basel III capital standards. The contractual maturities of the held-to-maturity securities are greater than 10 years and they are subject to prepayment by the issuers.
Accumulated OCI included after-tax net unrealized gains of
$3.1 billion
and
$7.4 billion
at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, comprised primarily of after-tax net unrealized gains of
$3.1 billion
and
$714 million
related to AFS debt securities and after-tax net unrealized gains of
$3 million
and
$6.7 billion
related to AFS marketable equity securities. The
December 31, 2010
unrealized gain on marketable equity securities was related to our investment in CCB. See
Note 5  Securities
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for further discussion on marketable equity securities. The net unrealized gains in accumulated OCI related to AFS debt securities increased
$3.9 billion
during
2011
to
$5.0 billion
, primarily due to a lower interest rate environment.
We recognized
$299 million
of other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) losses in earnings on AFS debt securities in
2011
compared to $970 million on AFS debt and marketable equity securities in
2010
. The recognition of OTTI losses on AFS debt and marketable equity securities is based on a variety of factors, including the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than amortized cost, the financial condition of the issuer of the security including credit ratings and any specific events affecting the operations of the issuer, underlying assets that collateralize the debt security, other industry and macroeconomic conditions, and our intent and ability to hold the security to recovery.
Residential Mortgage Portfolio
At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, our residential mortgage portfolio was
$262.3 billion
(which excludes
$906 million
in
 
residential mortgage loans accounted for under the fair value option) and
$258.0 billion
. For more information on consumer fair value option loans, see
Consumer Credit Risk  Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option
on page
69
. Outstanding residential mortgage loans
increased
$4.3 billion
in
2011
as new origination volume was partially offset by paydowns, charge-offs and transfers to foreclosed properties. In addition, we repurchased $7.8 billion of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA which also increased the residential mortgage portfolio during
2011
.
During
2011
and
2010
, we retained $45.5 billion and $63.8 billion in first-lien mortgages originated by
CRES
and
GWIM
. We received paydowns of $42.3 billion and $38.2 billion in
2011
and
2010
. There were no loans securitized in
2011
compared to
$2.4 billion
of loans securitized into MBS which we retained in
2010
. We recognized gains of $68 million on the securitizations completed in
2010
. We purchased $72 million of residential mortgages related to ALM activities in
2011
compared to none in
2010
. We sold $109 million and $443 million of residential mortgages in
2011
and
2010
, of which all of the
2011
sales were originated residential mortgages and $432 million of the
2010
sales were originated residential mortgages and $11 million were previously purchased from third parties. Net gains on these transactions were minimal.
Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts
Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. For additional information on our hedging activities, see
Note 4  Derivatives
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
Our interest rate contracts are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards. In addition, we use foreign exchange contracts, including cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward contracts and options to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities.
Changes to the composition of our derivatives portfolio during
2011
reflect actions taken for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk management. The decisions to reposition our derivatives portfolio are based upon the current assessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and trends, and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions.
Table 60
includes derivatives utilized in our ALM activities including those designated as accounting and economic hedging instruments and shows the notional amount, fair value, weighted-average receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected maturity and average estimated durations of our open ALM derivatives at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
. Our interest rate swap positions, including foreign exchange contracts, were a net receive-fixed position of $67.9 billion and $6.4 billion at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
. The notional amount of our foreign exchange basis swaps was
$262.4 billion
and
$235.2 billion
at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
. Our futures and forwards notional position, which reflects the net of long and short positions, was a long position of
$12.2 billion
at
December 31, 2011
compared to a short position of
$280 million
at
December 31, 2010
. These changes in notional amounts are the result of ongoing interest rate and currency risk management positioning.
The fair value of net ALM contracts
decreased
$7.9 billion
to a
gain
of
$4.7 billion
at
December 31, 2011
compared to
$12.6 billion
at
December 31, 2010
. The
decrease
was primarily
 
attributable to changes in the value of U.S. dollar-denominated pay-fixed interest rate swaps of
$9.7 billion
, foreign exchange contracts of
$1.8 billion
and foreign exchange basis swaps of
$1.4 billion
. The decrease was partially offset by a gain from the changes in the value of U.S. dollar-denominated receive-fixed interest rate swaps of
$6.6 billion
.
We use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). The net losses on both open and terminated derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI, net-of-tax, were
$3.8 billion
and
$3.2 billion
at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
. These net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at
December 31, 2011
, the pre-tax net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: $1.5 billion, or 26 percent within the next year, 55 percent in years two through five, and 12 percent in years six through ten, with the remaining seven percent thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see
Note 4  Derivatives
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
We hedge our net investment in non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency basis swaps, foreign exchange options and foreign currency-denominated debt. We recorded after-tax gains on derivatives and foreign currency-denominated debt in accumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges which were offset by losses on our net investments in consolidated non-U.S. entities at
December 31, 2011
.
Mortgage Banking Risk Management
We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be HFI or held-for-sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate.
Interest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Fluctuations in interest rates drive consumer demand for new mortgages and the level of refinancing activity, which in turn, affects total origination and service fee income. Typically, a decline in mortgage interest rates will lead to an increase in mortgage originations and fees and a decrease in the value of the MSRs driven by higher prepayment expectations. Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage banking is a complex process that requires complex modeling and ongoing monitoring. IRLCs and the related residential first mortgage LHFS are subject to interest rate risk between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market. To hedge interest rate risk, we utilize forward loan sale commitments and other derivative instruments including purchased options. These instruments are used as economic hedges of IRLCs and residential first mortgage LHFS. At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the notional amount of derivatives economically hedging the IRLCs and residential first mortgage LHFS was $14.7 billion and $129.0 billion.
MSRs are nonfinancial assets created when the underlying mortgage loan is sold to investors and we retain the right to service the loan. We use certain derivatives such as interest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements, Eurodollar and U.S. Treasury futures, as well as mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities as economic hedges of MSRs. The notional amounts of the derivative contracts and other securities designated as economic hedges of MSRs were $2.6 trillion and $46.3 billion at
 
December 31, 2011
compared to $1.6 trillion and $60.3 billion at
December 31, 2010
. In
2011
, we recorded gains in mortgage banking income of $6.3 billion related to the change in fair value of these economic hedges compared to $5.0 billion for
2010
. For additional information on MSRs, see
Note 25  Mortgage Servicing Rights
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
and for more information on mortgage banking income, see
CRES

Compliance Risk Management
Compliance risk arises from the failure to adhere to laws, rules, regulations, and internal policies and procedures. Compliance risk can expose the Corporation to reputational risks as well as fines, civil money penalties or payment of damages and can lead to diminished business opportunities and diminished ability to expand key operations. Compliance is at the core of the Corporations culture and is a key component of risk management discipline.
The Global Compliance organization is responsible for driving a culture of compliance, establishing compliance program standards and policies; executing, monitoring and testing of business controls; performing risk assessments on the businesses adherence to laws, rules and standards as well as effectiveness of business controls; delivering compliance risk reporting; and ensuring the identification, escalation, and timely mitigation of emerging and existing compliance risks. Global Compliance is also responsible for facilitating processes to effectively manage and influence the dynamic regulatory environment and build constructive relationships with regulators.
The Board provides oversight of compliance risks through its Audit Committee.
Operational Risk Management
The Corporation defines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Operational risk may occur anywhere in the Corporation, not solely in operations functions, and its effects may extend beyond financial losses. Operational risk includes legal risk. Successful operational risk management is particularly important to diversified financial services companies because of the nature, volume and complexity of the financial services business. Global banking guidelines and country-specific requirements for managing operational risk were established in Basel II which require that the Corporation has internal operational risk management processes to assess and measure operational risk exposure and to set aside appropriate capital to address those exposures.
Under the Basel II Rules, an operational loss event is an event that results in a loss and is associated with any of the following seven operational loss event categories: internal fraud; external fraud; employment practices and workplace safety; clients, products and business practices; damage to physical assets; business disruption and system failures; and execution, delivery and process management. Specific examples of loss events include robberies, credit card fraud, processing errors and physical losses from natural disasters.
Under our Operational Risk Management Program, we approach operational risk management from two perspectives to best manage operational risk within the structure of the Corporation: (1) at the enterprise level to provide independent, integrated management of operational risk across the organization, and (2) at
the business and enterprise control function levels to address operational risk in revenue producing and non-revenue producing units. A sound internal governance structure enhances the effectiveness of the Corporations Operational Risk Management Program and is accomplished at the enterprise level through formal oversight by the Board, the CRO and a variety of management committees and risk oversight groups aligned to the Corporations overall risk governance framework and practices. Of these, the Operational Risk Committee (ORC) oversees and approves the Corporations policies and processes for sound operational risk management. The ORC also serves as an escalation point for critical operational risk matters within the Corporation. The ORC reports operational risk activities to the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Board.
Within the Global Risk Management organization, the Corporate Operational Risk team develops and guides the strategies, policies, practices, controls and monitoring tools for assessing and managing operational risks across the organization and reports results to the businesses, enterprise control functions, senior management, governance committees and the Board.
The business and enterprise control functions are responsible for all the risks within the business line, including operational risks. In addition to enterprise risk management tools such as loss reporting, scenario analysis and RCSAs, operational risk executives, working in conjunction with senior business executives, have developed key tools to help identify, measure, mitigate and monitor risk in each business and enterprise control function. Examples of these include personnel management practices, data reconciliation processes, fraud management units, transaction processing monitoring and analysis, business recovery planning and new product introduction processes. The business and enterprise control functions are also responsible for consistently implementing and monitoring adherence to corporate practices.
Business and enterprise control function management uses the enterprise risk and control self-assessment process to identify and evaluate the status of risk and control issues, including mitigation plans, as appropriate. The goal of this process is to assess changing market and business conditions, to evaluate key risks impacting each business and enterprise control function and assess the controls in place to mitigate the risks. The risk and control self-assessment process is documented at periodic intervals. Key operational risk indicators for these risks have been developed and are used to help identify trends and issues on an enterprise, business and enterprise control function level. Independent review and challenge to the Corporations overall operational risk management framework is performed by the Corporate Operational Risk Validation Team.
The enterprise control functions participate in the operational risk management process in two ways. First, these organizations manage risk in their functional department. Second, they provide specialized risk management services (e.g., information management, vendor management) within their area of expertise to the enterprise and the businesses and other enterprise control functions they support. These groups also work with business and risk executives to develop and guide appropriate strategies, policies, practices, controls and monitoring tools for each business and enterprise control function relative to these programs.
Additionally, where appropriate, insurance policies are purchased to mitigate the impact of operational losses when and if they occur. These insurance policies are explicitly incorporated in the structural features of operational risk evaluation. As
 
insurance recoveries, especially given recent market events, are subject to legal and financial uncertainty, the inclusion of these insurance policies is subject to reductions in their expected mitigating benefits.
Complex Accounting Estimates
Our significant accounting principles, as described in
Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Principles
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
are essential in understanding the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments.
The more judgmental estimates are summarized in the following discussion. We have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes that, with the exception of accrued taxes, involve mathematical models to derive the estimates. In many cases, there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the models. Where alternatives exist, we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs. Actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could impact our results of operations. Separate from the possible future impact to our results of operations from input and model variables, the value of our lending portfolio and market-sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date, often significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future operating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, represents managements estimate of probable losses inherent in the Corporations loan portfolio excluding those loans accounted for under the fair value option. Changes to the allowance for credit losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income in the provision for credit losses. Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in
Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Principles
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
. We evaluate our allowance at the portfolio segment level and our portfolio segments are home loans, credit card and other consumer, and commercial. Due to the variability in the drivers of the assumptions used in this process, estimates of the portfolios inherent risks and overall collectability change with changes in the economy, individual industries, countries, and borrowers or counterparties ability and willingness to repay their obligations. The degree to which any particular assumption affects the allowance for credit losses depends on the severity of the change and its relationship to the other assumptions.
Key judgments used in determining the allowance for credit losses include risk ratings for pools of commercial loans and leases, market and collateral values and discount rates for individually evaluated loans, product type classifications for consumer and commercial loans and leases, loss rates used for
consumer and commercial loans and leases, adjustments made to address current events and conditions, considerations regarding domestic and global economic uncertainty, and overall credit conditions.
Our estimate for the allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the loss rates and expected cash flows from our home loans, and credit card and other consumer portfolio segments. For each one percent increase in the loss rates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment in our home loans portfolio segment, excluding PCI loans, coupled with a one percent decrease in the discounted cash flows on those loans individually evaluated for impairment within this portfolio segment, the allowance for loan and lease losses at
December 31, 2011
would have increased by $156 million. PCI loans within our home loans portfolio segment are initially recorded at fair value. Applicable accounting guidance prohibits carry-over or creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting. However, subsequent decreases in the expected cash flows from the date of acquisition result in a charge to the provision for credit losses and a corresponding increase to the allowance for loan and lease losses. We subject our PCI portfolio to stress scenarios to evaluate the potential impact given certain events. A one percent decrease in the expected cash flows could result in a $241 million impairment of the portfolio, of which $115 million would be related to our discontinued real estate portfolio. For each one percent increase in the loss rates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment within our credit card and other consumer portfolio segment coupled with a one percent decrease in the expected cash flows on those loans individually evaluated for impairment within this portfolio segment, the allowance for loan and lease losses at
December 31, 2011
would have increased by $84 million.
Our allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the risk ratings assigned to loans and leases within our commercial portfolio segment. Assuming a downgrade of one level in the internal risk ratings for commercial loans and leases, except loans and leases already risk-rated Doubtful as defined by regulatory authorities, the allowance for loan and lease losses would have increased by $3.1 billion at
December 31, 2011
.
The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases at
December 31, 2011
was
3.68 percent
and these hypothetical increases in the allowance would raise the ratio to 4.00 percent.
These sensitivity analyses do not represent managements expectations of the deterioration in risk ratings or the increases in loss rates but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for loan and lease losses to changes in key inputs. We believe the risk ratings and loss severities currently in use are appropriate and that the probability of the alternative scenarios outlined above occurring within a short period of time is remote.
The process of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses requires a high degree of judgment. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions.
Mortgage Servicing Rights
MSRs are nonfinancial assets that are created when a mortgage loan is sold and we retain the right to service the loan. We account for consumer MSRs at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income in mortgage banking income. Commercial-related and residential reverse mortgage
 
MSRs are accounted for using the amortization method, lower of amortized cost or fair value, with impairment recognized as a reduction of mortgage banking income. At
December 31, 2011
, our total MSR balance was
$7.5 billion
.
We determine the fair value of our consumer MSRs using a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The model incorporates key economic assumptions including estimates of prepayment rates and resultant weighted-average lives of the MSRs, and the option-adjusted spread levels. These variables can, and generally do, change from quarter to quarter as market conditions and projected interest rates change. These assumptions are subjective in nature and changes in these assumptions could materially affect our operating results. For example, decreasing the prepayment rate assumption used in the valuation of our consumer MSRs by 10 percent while keeping all other assumptions unchanged could have resulted in an estimated increase of
$639 million
in MSRs and mortgage banking income at
December 31, 2011
. This impact does not reflect any hedge strategies that may be undertaken to mitigate such risk.
We manage potential changes in the fair value of MSRs through a comprehensive risk management program. The intent is to mitigate the effects of changes in the fair value of MSRs through the use of risk management instruments. To reduce the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate and market value fluctuations, securities as well as certain derivatives such as options and interest rate swaps may be used as economic hedges of the MSRs, but are not designated as accounting hedges. These instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in mortgage banking income. For more information, see
Mortgage Banking Risk Management
on page

.
For additional information on MSRs, including the sensitivity of weighted-average lives and the fair value of MSRs to changes in modeled assumptions, see
Note 25  Mortgage Servicing Rights
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
We determine the fair values of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy under applicable accounting guidance which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Applicable accounting guidance establishes three levels of inputs used to measure fair value. We carry trading account assets and liabilities, derivative assets and liabilities, AFS debt and marketable equity securities, certain MSRs and certain other assets at fair value. Also, we account for certain corporate loans and loan commitments, LHFS, other short-term borrowings, securities financing agreements, asset-backed secured financings, long-term deposits and long-term debt under the fair value option. For more information, see
Note 22  Fair Value Measurements
and
Note 23  Fair Value Option
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
The fair values of assets and liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, credit quality and other deal specific factors, where appropriate. Valuations of products using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs. Where market data is available, the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of our valuation date. Inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are supported by little or no market activity. In periods of extreme volatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be
more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process. In keeping with the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities, we have in place various processes and controls that include: a model validation policy that requires review and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing, financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification; a trading product valuation policy that requires verification of all traded product valuations; and a periodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded products. Primarily through validation controls, we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both market-observable and internally-modeled values and/or valuation inputs. Our reliance on this information is tempered by the knowledge of how the broker and/or pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and lesser reliance applied to those developed through their own internal modeling. Similarly, broker quotes that are executable are given a higher level of reliance than indicative broker quotes, which are not executable. These processes and controls are performed independently of the business.
Trading account assets and liabilities are carried at fair value based primarily on actively traded markets where prices are from either direct market quotes or observed transactions. Liquidity is a significant factor in the determination of the fair value of trading account assets and liabilities. Market price quotes may not be readily available for some positions, or positions within a market sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased. Situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by market perception of credit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector. In these instances, fair value is determined based on limited available market information and other factors, principally from reviewing the issuers financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by one or more of the rating agencies.
Trading account profits, which represent the net amount earned from our trading positions, can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Trading account profits are dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. To evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of individual positions as well as portfolios. At a portfolio and corporate level, we use
 
trading limits, stress testing and tools such as VaR modeling, which estimates a potential daily loss that we do not expect to exceed with a specified confidence level, to measure and manage market risk. For more information on VaR, see
Trading Risk Management
on page 
90
.
The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the OTC market are determined using quantitative models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors, which are used to value the positions. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. Estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions that are either option-based or have longer maturity dates where observable market inputs are less readily available or are unobservable, in which case quantitative-based extrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used in determining fair values. The Corporation incorporates within its fair value measurements of OTC derivatives a valuation adjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the net position. Positions are netted by counterparty and fair value for net long exposures is adjusted for counterparty credit risk while the fair value for net short exposures is adjusted for our own credit risk. The credit adjustments are determined by reference to existing direct market reference costs of credit, or where direct references are not available, a proxy is applied consistent with direct references for other counterparties that are similar in credit risk. An estimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of fair value, primarily based on market implied experience adjusted for any more recent name specific expectations.
Level 3 Assets and Liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy established in applicable accounting guidance. The Level 3 financial assets and liabilities include consumer MSRs, highly structured, complex or long-dated derivative contracts and private equity investments, as well as certain loans, MBS, ABS, structured liabilities and CDOs. The fair value of these Level 3 financial assets and liabilities is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.
During
2011
, we recognized net gains of
$451 million
on Level 3 assets and liabilities. The net gains during the year were primarily in trading account profits combined with gains on IRLCs, partially offset by losses on MSRs. There were net unrealized gains of
$19 million
in accumulated OCI on Level 3 assets and liabilities at
December 31, 2011
.
Level 3 financial instruments, such as our consumer MSRs, may be economically hedged with derivatives classified as Level 1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses associated with Level 3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of the fair value hierarchy. The Level 3 gains and losses recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital resources.
We conduct a review of our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of Level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace. These transfers are considered to be effective as of the beginning of the quarter in which they occur. For additional information on the significant transfers into and out of Level 3 during
2011

Global Principal Investments
GPI is included within Equity Investments in
All Other
on page 
31
. GPI is comprised of a diversified portfolio of private equity, real estate and other alternative investments in both privately-held and publicly-traded companies. These investments are made either directly in a company or held through a fund. At
December 31, 2011
, this portfolio totaled
$5.7 billion
including $4.4 billion of non-public investments.
Certain equity investments in the portfolio are subject to investment company accounting under applicable accounting guidance, and accordingly, are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in equity investment income. Initially the transaction price of the investment is generally considered to be the best indicator of fair value. Thereafter, valuation of direct investments is based on an assessment of each individual investment using methodologies that include publicly-traded comparables derived by multiplying a key performance metric (e.g.,
 
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of the portfolio company by the relevant valuation multiple observed for comparable companies, acquisition comparables, entry-level multiples and discounted cash flows, and are subject to appropriate discounts for lack of liquidity or marketability. Certain factors that may influence changes in fair value include but are not limited to, recapitalizations, subsequent rounds of financing and offerings in the equity or debt capital markets. For fund investments, we generally record the fair value of our proportionate interest in the funds capital as reported by the funds respective managers.
Accrued Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets
Accrued income taxes, reported as a component of accrued expenses and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date. We currently file income tax returns in more than 100 jurisdictions and consider many factors, including statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance
,
in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction.
In applying the applicable accounting guidance, we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimate of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities. These revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes, which also may result from our income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies, may be material to our operating results for any given period.
Net deferred tax assets, reported as a component of other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net decrease in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of net operating loss (NOL) and tax credit carryforwards and because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements. NOL and tax credit carryforwards result in reductions to future tax liabilities, and many of these attributes can expire if not utilized within certain periods. We consider the need for valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amounts we estimate are more-likely-than-not to be realized.
While we have established some valuation allowances for certain state and non-U.S. deferred tax assets, we have concluded that our estimates of future taxable income by jurisdiction will be sufficient to realize all U.S. federal and U.K. deferred tax assets, including NOL and tax credit carryforwards, that are not subject to any special limitations (such as change-in-control limitations) prior to any expiration. Significant decreases to our estimate of future taxable income by jurisdiction could materially change our conclusions about how much of our tax attributes and other deferred tax assets are more-likely-than-not to be realized prior to their expiration. See
Note 21  Income Taxes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for a table of significant tax attributes and additional information.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Background
The nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in
Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Principles
and
Note 10  Goodwill and Intangible Assets
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
. Goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, which for the Corporation is performed as of June 30, and in interim periods if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below. As reporting units are determined after an acquisition or evolve with changes in business strategy, goodwill is assigned to reporting units and it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition. All of the revenue streams and related activities of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organic, are available to support the value of the goodwill.
We use the reporting units allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying amount of equity for each reporting unit in our goodwill impairment tests as we do not maintain a record of equity as defined under GAAP at the reporting unit level. Allocated equity includes economic capital, goodwill and a percentage of intangible assets allocated to the reporting units. The allocation of economic capital to the reporting units utilized for goodwill impairment testing has the same basis as the allocation of economic capital to our operating segments. Economic capital allocation plans are incorporated into the Corporations financial plan which is approved by the Board on an annual basis. Allocated equity is updated on a quarterly basis.
The Corporations common stock price remained volatile during 2011 and 2010 primarily due to the continued uncertainty in the economy and in the financial services industry, as well as adverse developments related to our mortgage business and increased regulation. During these periods, our market capitalization remained below our recorded book value. We estimate that the fair value of all reporting units in aggregate as of the June 30, 2011 annual goodwill impairment test was $210.2 billion and the common stock market capitalization of the Corporation as of that date was
$111.1 billion
(
$58.6 billion
at
December 31, 2011
). As none of our reporting units are publicly-traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations do not directly correlate to the Corporations stock price. Although we believe it is reasonable to conclude that market capitalization could be an indicator of fair value over time, we do not believe that recent fluctuations in our market capitalization reflect the fair value of our individual reporting units.
Estimating the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments,
 
particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium. We determined the fair values of the reporting units using a combination of valuation techniques consistent with the market approach and the income approach, and included the use of independent valuation specialists.
The market approach we used estimates the fair value of the individual reporting units by incorporating any combination of the tangible capital, book capital and earnings multiples from comparable publicly-traded companies in industries similar to that of the reporting unit. The relative weight assigned to these multiples varies among the reporting units based on qualitative and quantitative characteristics, primarily the size and relative profitability of the reporting unit as compared to the comparable publicly-traded companies. Since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of a noncontrolling interest, a control premium was added to arrive at the reporting units estimated fair values on a controlling basis.
For purposes of the income approach, we calculated discounted cash flows by taking the net present value of estimated future cash flows and an appropriate terminal value. Our discounted cash flow analysis employs a capital asset pricing model in estimating the discount rate (i.e., cost of equity financing) for each reporting unit. The inputs to this model include the risk-free rate of return, beta, which is a measure of the level of non-diversifiable risk associated with comparable companies for each specific reporting unit, market equity risk premium and in certain cases an unsystematic (company-specific) risk factor. The unsystematic risk factor is the input that specifically addresses uncertainty related to our projections of earnings and growth, including the uncertainty related to loss expectations. We utilized discount rates that we believe adequately reflect the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets generally and specifically in our internally developed forecasts. We estimated expected rates of equity returns based on historical market returns and risk/return rates for similar industries of the reporting unit. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and actual results may differ from forecasted results.
International Consumer Card Businesses
Of the $1.9 billion of goodwill associated with the international consumer card businesses, $526 million of goodwill was allocated, on a relative fair value basis, to the Canadian consumer card business which was sold on December 1, 2011.
During the three months ended
December 31, 2011
, a goodwill impairment test was performed for the European consumer card businesses reporting unit as it was likely that the carrying amount of the business exceeded the fair value due to a decrease in future growth projections. We concluded that goodwill was impaired, and accordingly, recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of
$581 million
for the European consumer card businesses.
Consumer Real Estate Services
In connection with the sale of Balboa on June 1, 2011, we allocated, on a relative fair value basis,
$193 million
of
CRES
goodwill to the business in determining the gain on the sale.
During the three months ended June 30, 2011, as a consequence of the BNY Mellon Settlement entered into by the Corporation on June 28, 2011, the adverse impact of the incremental mortgage-related charges and the continued economic slowdown in the mortgage business, we performed a
goodwill impairment test for the
CRES
reporting unit. We concluded that the remaining balance of goodwill of
$2.6 billion
was impaired, and accordingly, recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill in
CRES
to zero.
2011 Annual Impairment Test
During the three months ended September 30, 2011, we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2011 for all reporting units which had goodwill. In performing the first step of the annual goodwill impairment analysis, we compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its current carrying value, including goodwill. To determine fair value, we utilized a combination of the market approach and income approach. Under the market approach, we compared earnings and equity multiples of the individual reporting units to multiples of public companies comparable to the individual reporting units. The control premiums used in the June 30, 2011 annual goodwill impairment test ranged from 25 percent to 35 percent. Under the income approach, we updated our assumptions to reflect the current market environment. The discount rates used in the June 30, 2011 annual goodwill impairment test ranged from 11 percent to 16 percent depending on the relative risk of a reporting unit. Growth rates developed by management for individual revenue and expense items in each reporting unit ranged from 0.7 percent to 6.7 percent. For certain revenue and expense items that have been significantly affected by the current economic environment and financial reform, management developed separate long-term forecasts.
Based on the results of step one of the annual goodwill impairment test, we determined that step two was not required for any of the reporting units as their fair value exceeded their carrying value indicating there was no impairment.
2010 Impairment Tests
During the three months ended September 30, 2010, we performed a goodwill impairment test for the Card Services reporting unit within
CBB
due to the continued stress on the business and the uncertain debit card interchange provisions under the Financial Reform Act. We concluded that goodwill was impaired, and accordingly, recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of
$10.4 billion
to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill in
CBB
.
During the three months ended December 31, 2010, we performed a goodwill impairment test for the
CRES
reporting unit as it was likely that there was a decline in its fair value as a result of increased uncertainties, including existing and potential litigation exposure and other related risks, higher servicing costs including those related to loss mitigation, foreclosure related issues and the redeployment of centralized sales resources. We concluded that goodwill was impaired, and accordingly, recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of
$2.0 billion
in
CRES
.
Representations and Warranties
The methodology used to estimate the liability for obligations under representations and warranties related to transfers of residential mortgage loans is a function of the representations and warranties given and considers a variety of factors. Depending upon the counterparty, these factors include actual defaults, estimated future defaults, historical loss experience, estimated home prices, other economic conditions, estimated probability that we will
 
receive a repurchase request, including consideration of whether presentation thresholds will be met, number of payments made by the borrower prior to default, estimated probability that we will be required to repurchase a loan and the experience with and the behavior of the counterparty. It also considers bulk settlements, as appropriate. The estimate of the liability for obligations under representations and warranties is based upon currently available information, significant judgment, and a number of factors, including those set forth above, that are subject to change. Changes to any one of these factors could significantly impact the estimate of our liability.
The provision for representations and warranties may vary significantly each period as the methodology used to estimate the expense continues to be refined based on the level and type of repurchase requests presented, defects identified, the latest experience gained on repurchase requests and other relevant facts and circumstances. The estimated range of possible loss related to non-GSE representations and warranties exposure has been disclosed. For the GSE claims where we have established a representations and warranties liability as discussed in
Note 9  Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
, an assumed simultaneous increase or decrease of
10
 percent in estimated future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate would result in an increase of approximately
$850 million
or decrease of approximately
$800 million
in the representations and warranties liability as of
December 31, 2011
. Viewed from the perspective of home prices, for each one percent change in home prices, the liability for representations and warranties on unsettled GSE originations is estimated to be impacted by
$125 million
based on projected collateral losses and defect rates. These sensitivities are hypothetical and are intended to provide an indication of the impact of a significant change in these key assumptions on the representations and warranties liability. In reality, changes in one assumption may result in changes in other assumptions, which may or may not counteract the sensitivity.
For additional information on representations and warranties, see
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  Representations and Warranties

, as well as
Note 9  Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees
and
Note 14  Commitments and Contingencies
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.
Litigation Reserve
In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Corporation establishes an accrued liability for litigation and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. When a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, the Corporation does not establish an accrued liability. As a litigation or regulatory matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates on an ongoing basis whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is both probable and estimable. If, at the time of evaluation, the loss contingency related to a litigation or regulatory matter is not both probable and estimable, the matter will continue to be monitored for further developments that would make such loss contingency both probable and estimable. Once the loss contingency related to a litigation or regulatory matter is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability
with respect to such loss contingency and record a corresponding amount of litigation-related expense. The Corporation will continue to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established.
For a limited number of the matters disclosed in
Note 14  Commitments and Contingencies
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, we are able to estimate a range of possible loss. In determining whether it is possible to provide an estimate of loss or range of possible loss, the Corporation reviews and evaluates its material litigation and regulatory matters on an ongoing basis, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. These may include information learned through the discovery process, rulings on dispositive motions, settlement discussions, and other rulings by courts, arbitrators or others. In cases in which the Corporation possesses sufficient information to develop an estimate of loss or range of possible loss, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed in
Note 14  Commitments and Contingencies
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
. For other disclosed matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, such an estimate is not possible. Those matters for which an estimate is not possible are not included within this estimated range. Therefore, the estimated range of possible loss represents what we believe to be an estimate of possible loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria. It does not represent the Corporations maximum loss exposure. Information is provided in
Note 14  Commitments and Contingencies
to the Consolidated Financial Statements
regarding the nature of all of these contingencies and, where specified, the amount of the claim associated with these loss contingencies.
Consolidation and Accounting for Variable Interest Entities
In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, an entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. The Corporation is deemed to have a controlling financial interest and is the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities
 
of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
Determining whether an entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE requires significant judgment. An entity must assess the purpose and design of the VIE, including explicit and implicit contractual arrangements, and the entitys involvement in both the design of the VIE and its ongoing activities. The entity must then determine which activities have the most significant impact on the economic performance of the VIE and whether the entity has the power to direct such activities. For VIEs that hold financial assets, the party that services the assets or makes investment management decisions may have the power to direct the most significant activities of a VIE. Alternatively, a third party that has the unilateral right to replace the servicer or investment manager or to liquidate the VIE may be deemed to be the party with power. If there are no significant ongoing activities, the party that was responsible for the design of the VIE may be deemed to have power. If the entity determines that it has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE, then the entity must determine if it has either an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Such economic interests may include investments in debt or equity instruments issued by the VIE, liquidity commitments, and explicit and implicit guarantees.
On a quarterly basis, we reassess whether we have a controlling financial interest and are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The quarterly reassessment process considers whether we have acquired or divested the power to direct the activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. The reassessment also considers whether we have acquired or disposed of a financial interest that could be significant to the VIE, or whether an interest in the VIE has become significant or is no longer significant. The consolidation status of the VIEs with which we are involved may change as a result of such reassessments. Changes in consolidation status are applied prospectively, with assets and liabilities of a newly consolidated VIE initially recorded at fair value. A gain or loss may be recognized upon deconsolidation of a VIE depending on the carrying amounts of deconsolidated assets and liabilities compared to the fair value of retained interests and ongoing contractual arrangements.
2010 Compared to 2009
The following discussion and analysis provides a comparison of our results of operations for
2010
and
2009
. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. Tables
7
and
8
contain financial data to supplement this discussion.
Overview
Net Income/Loss
Net loss totaled
$2.2 billion
in
2010
compared to net income of
$6.3 billion
in
2009
. Including preferred stock dividends, the net loss applicable to common shareholders was
$3.6 billion
, or
$(0.37)
per diluted share. Those results compared to a net loss applicable to common shareholders of
$2.2 billion
, or
$(0.29)
per diluted share for
2009
.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income on a FTE basis increased $4.3 billion to
$52.7 billion
for
2010
compared to
2009
. The increase was due to the impact of deposit pricing and the adoption of new consolidation guidance which contributed $10.5 billion to net interest income in 2010. The increase was partially offset by lower commercial and consumer loan levels, the sale of First Republic in 2010 and lower rates on core assets and trading assets and liabilities, including derivative exposures. The net interest yield on a FTE basis increased 13 bps to
2.78 percent
for
2010
compared to
2009
due to the factors described above.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income decreased
$13.8 billion
to
$58.7 billion
in
2010
compared to
2009
. Card income decreased $245 million due to the implementation of the CARD Act partially offset by the impact of the new consolidation guidance and higher interchange income. Service charges decreased $1.6 billion largely due to the impact of overdraft policy changes in conjunction with Regulation E, which became effective in the third quarter of 2010 and the impact of our overdraft policy changes implemented in late 2009. Equity investment income decreased $4.8 billion, as net gains on the sales of certain strategic investments during 2010
were less than gains in 2009 that included a $7.3 billion gain related to the sale of a portion of our investment in CCB. Trading account profits decreased $2.2 billion due to more favorable market conditions in 2009 and investor concerns regarding sovereign debt fears and regulatory uncertainty. DVA gains, net of hedges, on derivative liabilities of $262 million for 2010 compared to losses of $662 million for 2009. Mortgage banking income decreased $6.1 billion due to an increase of $4.9 billion in representations and warranties provision and lower volume and margins. Gains on sales of debt securities decreased $2.2 billion driven by a lower volume of sales of debt securities. The decrease also included the impact of losses in 2010 related to portfolio restructuring activities. Other income (loss) improved by $2.4 billion. 2009 included a net negative fair value adjustment related to our own credit of $4.9 billion on structured liabilities compared to a net positive adjustment of $18 million in 2010, and 2009 also included a $3.8 billion gain on the contribution of our merchant services business to a joint venture. Legacy asset write-downs included in other income (loss) were $1.7 billion in 2009 compared to net gains of $256 million in 2010. Impairment losses recognized in earnings on AFS debt securities decreased $1.9 billion reflecting lower impairment write-downs on non-agency RMBS and CDOs.
 
Provision for Credit Losses
The provision for credit losses decreased
$20.1 billion
to
$28.4 billion
for
2010
compared to
2009
due to improving portfolio trends across the consumer and commercial portfolios. Net charge-offs totaled $34.3 billion, or 3.60 percent of average loans and leases for
2010
compared to $33.7 billion, or 3.58 percent for
2009
.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense increased
$16.4 billion
to
$83.1 billion
for
2010
compared to
2009
largely due to goodwill impairment charges of
$12.4 billion
. The increase was also driven by a $3.6 billion increase in personnel costs reflecting the build-out of several businesses, the recognition of expense on proportionally larger 2009 incentive deferrals and the U.K. payroll tax on certain year-end incentive payments, as well as a $1.6 billion increase in litigation costs. These increases were partially offset by a $901 million decline in merger and restructuring charges compared to 2009. Noninterest expense for 2009 included a special FDIC assessment of $724 million.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense was
$915 million
for
2010
compared to a benefit of
$1.9 billion
for
2009
. The effective tax rate in
2010
was not meaningful due to the impact of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges of
$12.4 billion
. The effective tax rate for
2010
excluding goodwill impairment charges was 8.3 percent compared to (44.0) percent in
2009
. The change in the effective tax rate from the prior year was primarily driven by an increase in pre-tax income excluding the non-deductible goodwill impairment charges. Also impacting the 2010 effective tax rate was a $392 million charge from a U.K. law change and a $1.7 billion tax benefit from the release of a portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to acquired capital loss carryforward tax benefits compared to $650 million in 2009.
Business Segment Operations
Consumer & Business Banking
CBB
recorded a net loss of
$5.1 billion
in 2010 compared to net income of $232 million in 2009 primarily due to a $10.4 billion goodwill impairment charge, a decline in revenue and an increase in litigation expense, partially offset by lower provision for credit losses. Net interest income decreased $1.1 billion to $24.3 billion due to a decrease in average loans and yields and a lower net interest income allocation related to ALM activities, partially offset by a customer shift to more liquid deposit products and continued deposit pricing discipline. Noninterest income decreased $6.1 billion to $13.9 billion driven by the 2009 gain of $3.8 billion related to the contribution of the merchant services business into a joint venture, the impact of overdraft policy changes in conjunction with Regulation E, which was effective in the third quarter of 2010, as well as our overdraft policy changes implemented in late 2009 and lower card income primarily due to the implementation of the CARD Act. The decreases in noninterest income were partially offset by higher interchange income during 2010 and the gain on the sale of our MasterCard position. The provision for credit losses improved $16.0 billion to $11.6 billion due to lower delinquencies and bankruptcies as a result of the improved economic environment, which resulted in a reduction in
the allowance for credit losses in 2010 compared to an increase in 2009. Noninterest expense increased $11.3 billion to $28.6 billion primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge and litigation expense.
Consumer Real Estate Services
CRES
net loss increased $5.1 billion to a net loss of
$8.9 billion
in
2010
primarily due to a $4.9 billion increase in representations and warranties provision and a $2.0 billion goodwill impairment charge, partially offset by a decline in the provision for credit losses driven by improving portfolio trends. Mortgage banking income declined driven by the increased representations and warranties provision and lower production volume reflecting a drop in the overall size of the mortgage market. The provision for credit losses decreased $2.8 billion to
$8.5 billion
driven by improving portfolio trends which led to lower reserve additions, including those associated with the Countrywide PCI home equity portfolio. Noninterest expense increased $3.4 billion to
$14.8 billion
due to the goodwill impairment charge, higher litigation expense and an increase in default-related servicing expense, partially offset by lower production expense and insurance losses.
Global Banking
Net income increased $4.8 billion to
$4.9 billion
in
2010
driven by lower provision for credit losses. Net interest income decreased by $210 million to $10.1 billion as growth in average deposits was offset by a lower net interest income allocation related to ALM activities and a decline in average loan and lease balances. Noninterest income increased $1.3 billion to
$7.7 billion
primarily due to gains on legacy assets compared to losses in 2009. The provision for credit losses decreased $7.1 billion to
$1.3 billion
driven by improvements from stabilizing values in the commercial real estate portfolio and improved borrower credit profiles in the commercial portfolio.
Global Markets
Net income decreased $2.9 billion to
$4.2 billion
in
2010
driven by lower sales and trading revenue due to more favorable market conditions in 2009, partially offset by credit valuation gains on derivative liabilities and gains on legacy assets compared to losses in 2009. Sales and trading revenue, excluding DVA was
$16.4 billion
in
2010
compared to $17.5 billion in
2009
due to increased investor risk aversion and more favorable market conditions in 2009
. Noninterest expense increased $1.7 billion to
$11.8 billion
driven by higher compensation costs as a result of the recognition of expense on a proportionally larger amount of prior year incentive
 
deferrals and investments in infrastructure and personnel associated with further development of the business. Income tax expense was adversely affected by a charge related to the U.K. tax rate reduction impacting the carrying value of deferred tax assets.
Global Wealth & Investment Management
Net income decreased $346 million to
$1.4 billion
in
2010
driven by higher noninterest expense and the tax-related effect of the sale of the Columbia Management long-term asset management business partially offset by higher noninterest income and lower credit costs. Net interest income decreased $203 million to
$5.7 billion
as the positive impact of higher deposit levels was more than offset by lower revenue from corporate ALM activity. Noninterest income increased $685 million to
$10.6 billion
primarily due to higher asset management fees driven by stronger markets, continued long-term AUM flows and higher transactional activity. The provision for credit losses decreased $414 million to
$646 million
driven by improving portfolio trends and the recognition of a single large commercial charge-off in 2009. Noninterest expense increased $1.1 billion to
$13.2 billion
primarily due to higher revenue-related expenses, support costs and personnel costs associated with further investment in the business.
All Other
Net income increased $370 million to
$1.3 billion
in
2010
. Net interest income decreased $1.9 billion to
$3.7 billion
driven by a $1.4 billion lower funding differential on certain securitizations and the impact of capital raises occurring throughout 2009 that were not allocated to the businesses. Noninterest income decreased $5.7 billion to
$6.1 billion
as the prior year included a $7.3 billion gain resulting from a sale of shares of CCB and an increase of $1.4 billion on net gains on the sale of debt securities. This was offset by net negative fair value adjustments related to our own credit of $4.9 billion on structured liabilities in 2009 compared to a net positive adjustment of $18 million in 2010 and higher valuation adjustments and gains on sales of select investments in GPI. Also, in 2010, we sold our investments in Ita Unibanco and Santander
resulting in a net gain of approximately $800 million, as well as the gains on CCB and BlackRock.
The provision for credit losses decreased $4.9 billion to
$6.3 billion
due to improving portfolio trends in the residential mortgage portfolio partially offset by further deterioration in the Countrywide PCI discontinued real estate portfolio.

Glossary
Alt-A Mortgage
 A type of U.S. mortgage that, for various reasons, is considered riskier than A-paper, or prime, and less risky than subprime, the riskiest category. Alt-A interest rates, which are determined by credit risk, therefore tend to be between those of prime and subprime home loans. Typically, Alt-A mortgages are characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation, lower credit scores and higher LTVs.
Assets in Custody
 Consist largely of custodial and non-discretionary trust assets excluding brokerage assets administered for clients. Trust assets encompass a broad range of asset types including real estate, private company ownership interest, personal property and investments.
Assets Under Management (AUM)
 The total market value of assets under the investment advisory and discretion of
GWIM
which generate asset management fees based on a percentage of the assets market values. AUM reflects assets that are generally managed for institutional, high net-worth and retail clients, and are distributed through various investment products including mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and separate accounts.
Carrying Value (with respect to loans)
 The amount at which a loan is recorded on the balance sheet. For loans recorded at amortized cost, carrying value is the unpaid principal balance net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and costs, and unamortized purchase premium or discount. For loans that are or have been on nonaccrual status, the carrying value is also reduced by any net charge-offs that have been recorded and the amount of interest payments applied as a reduction of principal under the cost recovery method. For PCI loans, the carrying value equals fair value upon acquisition adjusted for subsequent cash collections and yield accreted to date. For credit card loans, the carrying value also includes interest that has been billed to the customer. For loans classified as held-for-sale, carrying value is the lower of carrying value as described in the sentences above, or fair value. For loans for which we have elected the fair value option, the carrying value is fair value.
Client Brokerage Assets
 Include client assets which are held in brokerage accounts. This includes non-discretionary brokerage and fee-based assets which generate brokerage income and asset management fee revenue.
Committed Credit Exposure
 Includes any funded portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on which the lender is legally bound to advance funds during a specified period under prescribed conditions.
Core Net Interest Income
 Net interest income on a FTE basis excluding the impact of market-based activities.
Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD Act)
 Legislation signed into law on May 22, 2009 that changes credit card industry practices including significantly restricting credit card issuers ability to change interest rates and assess fees to reflect individual consumer risk, changes the way payments are applied and changes consumer credit card
 
disclosures. The majority of the provisions became effective on February 22, 2010, while certain provisions became effective in the third quarter of 2010.
Credit Derivatives
 Contractual agreements that provide protection against a credit event on one or more referenced obligations. The nature of a credit event is established by the protection purchaser and protection seller at the inception of the transaction, and such events generally include bankruptcy or insolvency of the referenced credit entity, failure to meet payment obligations when due, as well as acceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or moratorium. The purchaser of the credit derivative pays a periodic fee in return for a payment by the protection seller upon the occurrence, if any, of such a credit event. A credit default swap is a type of a credit derivative.
Interest Rate Lock Commitment (IRLC)
 Commitment with a loan applicant in which the loan terms, including interest rate and price, are guaranteed for a designated period of time subject to credit approval.
Letter of Credit
 A document issued on behalf of a customer to a third party promising to pay the third party upon presentation of specified documents. A letter of credit effectively substitutes the issuers credit for that of the customer.
Loan-to-value (LTV)
 A commonly used credit quality metric that is reported in terms of ending and average LTV. Ending LTV is calculated as the outstanding carrying value of the loan at the end of the period divided by the estimated value of the property securing the loan. Estimated property values are primarily determined by utilizing the Case-Schiller Home Index, a widely used index based on data from repeat sales of single family homes. Case-Schiller indices are updated quarterly and are reported on a three-month or one-quarter lag. An additional metric related to LTV is
combined loan-to-value (CLTV)
which is similar to the LTV metric, yet combines the outstanding balance on the residential mortgage loan and the outstanding carrying value on the home equity loan or available line of credit, both of which are secured by the same property, divided by the estimated value of the property. A LTV of 100 percent reflects a loan that is currently secured by a property valued at an amount exactly equal to the carrying value or available line of the loan. Under certain circumstances, estimated values can also be determined by utilizing an automated valuation method (AVM) or Mortgage Risk Assessment Corporation (MRAC) index. An AVM is a tool that estimates the value of a property by reference to large volumes of market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to the MSA in which the property being valued is located. The MRAC index is similar to the Case-Schiller Home Index in that it is an index that is based on data from repeat sales of single family homes and is reported on a lag.
Mortgage Servicing Right (MSR)
 The right to service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors.
Net Interest Yield
 Net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets.
Nonperforming Loans and Leases
 Includes loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status, including nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties (TDRs). Loans accounted for under the fair value option, PCI loans and LHFS are not reported as nonperforming loans and leases. Consumer credit card loans, business card loans, consumer loans not secured by real estate, and consumer loans secured by real estate, which include loans insured by the FHA and individually insured long-term credit protection agreements with FNMA and FHLMC (fully-insured loan portfolio), are not placed on nonaccrual status and are, therefore, not reported as nonperforming loans and leases.
Purchased Credit-impaired (PCI) Loan
 A loan purchased as an individual loan, in a portfolio of loans or in a business combination with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination for which it is probable, upon acquisition, that the investor will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. These loans are recorded at fair value upon acquisition.
Subprime Loans
 Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not exist, the Corporation defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers, including individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk factors, such as low FICO scores, high debt to income ratios and inferior payment history.
Super Senior CDO Exposure
Represents the most senior class of commercial paper or notes that are issued by CDO vehicles. These financial instruments benefit from the subordination of all other securities, including AAA-rated securities, issued by CDO vehicles.
 
Tier 1 Common Capital
 Tier 1 capital including any CES, less preferred stock, qualifying trust preferred securities, hybrid securities and qualifying noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries.
Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs)
 Loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Certain consumer loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDRs. Concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate to a rate that is below market on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions intended to maximize collection. TDRs are generally reported as nonperforming loans and leases while on nonaccrual status. Nonperforming TDRs may be returned to accrual status when, among other criteria, payment in full of all amounts due under the restructured terms is expected and the borrower has demonstrated a sustained period of repayment performance, typically six months. TDRs that are on accrual status are reported as performing TDRs through the end of the calendar year in which the restructuring occurred or the year in which they are returned to accrual status. In addition, if accruing TDRs bear less than a market rate of interest at the time of modification, they are reported as performing TDRs throughout their remaining lives unless and until they cease to perform in accordance with their modified contractual terms, at which time they would be placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming TDRs.
Value-at-Risk (VaR)
 VaR represents the worst loss a portfolio is expected to experience based on historical trends with a given level of confidence, and depends on the volatility of the positions in the portfolio and on how strongly their risks are correlated. A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios and is a key statistic used to measure and manage market risk.

Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Bank of America Corporation and Subsidiaries
The management of Bank of America Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
The Corporations internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Corporations internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Corporation; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Corporation are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Corporation; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Corporations assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Corporations management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Corporations internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
 
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
NOTE 1 
Summary of Significant Accounting Principles
Bank of America Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, the Corporation), a financial holding company, provides a diverse range of financial services and products throughout the U.S. and in certain international markets. The term the Corporation as used herein may refer to the Corporation individually, the Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of the Corporations subsidiaries or affiliates.
The Corporation conducts its activities through banking and nonbanking subsidiaries. The Corporation operates its banking activities primarily under two charters: Bank of America, National Association (Bank of America, N.A. or BANA) and FIA Card Services, National Association (FIA Card Services, N.A.).
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries, and those variable interest entities (VIEs) where the Corporation is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Results of operations of acquired companies are included from the dates of acquisition and for VIEs, from the dates that the Corporation became the primary beneficiary. Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation accounts for investments in companies for which it owns a voting interest and for which it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financing decisions using the equity method of accounting or at fair value under the fair value option. These investments are included in other assets. Equity method investments are subject to impairment testing and the Corporations proportionate share of income or loss is included in equity investment income.
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Realized results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.
The Corporation evaluates subsequent events through the date of filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In April 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance on troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), including criteria to determine whether a loan modification represents a concession and whether the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties. This new accounting guidance was effective for the Corporation as of September 30, 2011 with retrospective application back to January 1, 2011. As a result of the
 
retrospective application, the Corporation classified
$1.1 billion
of commercial loan modifications as TDRs that in previous periods had not been classified as TDRs. These loans were newly identified as TDRs typically because the Corporation was not able to demonstrate that the modified rate of interest, although significantly higher than the rate prior to modification, was a market rate of interest. These loans include
$402 million
of performing commercial loans that had an aggregate allowance for credit losses of
$27 million
at
December 31, 2011
. Also, as a result of the new accounting guidance, loans that are participating in or that have been offered a binding trial modification are classified as TDRs. At
December 31, 2011
, the Corporation classified an additional
$2.6 billion
of home loans, with an aggregate allowance for credit losses of
$154 million
, as TDRs that were participating in or had been offered a trial modification.
In April 2011, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that addresses effective control in repurchase agreements and eliminates the requirement for entities to consider whether the transferor/seller has the ability to repurchase the financial assets in a repurchase agreement. This new accounting guidance was effective, on a prospective basis, for new transactions or modifications to existing transactions on January 1, 2012. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Corporations consolidated financial position or results of operations.
In May 2011, the FASB issued amendments to the fair value accounting guidance. The amendments clarify the application of the highest and best use, and valuation premise concepts, preclude the application of blockage factors in the valuation of all financial instruments and include criteria for applying the fair value measurement principles to portfolios of financial instruments. The amendments additionally prescribe enhanced financial statement disclosures for Level 3 fair value measurements. The new amendments were effective on January 1, 2012. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Corporations consolidated financial position or results of operations.
In June 2011, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income in financial statements. The new guidance requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements. This new accounting guidance is effective for the Corporation for the three months ended March 31, 2012.
In September 2011, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that simplifies goodwill impairment testing. The new guidance permits entities to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is likely that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If, under this assessment, it is likely that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, an entity is required to perform the two-step impairment test. The Corporation early adopted the new accounting guidance for certain goodwill impairment tests during the three months ended September 30, 2011.
In December 2011, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that requires additional disclosures on financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either offset in accordance with existing accounting guidance or are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement. The new requirements do not change the accounting guidance on netting, but rather enhance the disclosures to more clearly show the impact of netting arrangements on a companys financial position. This new accounting guidance will be effective, on a retrospective basis for all comparative periods presented, beginning on January 1, 2013.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items in the process of collection, and amounts due from correspondent banks and the Federal Reserve Bank.
Securities Financing Agreements
Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase (securities financing agreements) are treated as collateralized financing transactions. These agreements are recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest, except for certain securities financing agreements that the Corporation accounts for under the fair value option. Changes in the fair value of securities financing agreements that are accounted for under the fair value option are recorded in other income. For more information on securities financing agreements that the Corporation accounts for under the fair value option, see
Note 23  Fair Value Option
.
The Corporations policy is to obtain possession of collateral with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned under resale agreements. To ensure that the market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient, collateral is generally valued daily and the Corporation may require counterparties to deposit additional collateral or may return collateral pledged when appropriate. Securities financing agreements give rise to negligible credit risk as a result of these collateral provisions, and accordingly, no allowance for loan losses is considered necessary.
Substantially all repurchase and resale activities are transacted under legally enforceable master repurchase agreements that give the Corporation, in the event of default by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities held and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty. The Corporation offsets repurchase and resale transactions with the same counterparty on the Consolidated Balance Sheet where it has such a legally enforceable master agreement and the transactions have the same maturity date.
In transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in a securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, it recognizes an asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, representing the securities received, and a liability for the same amount, representing the obligation to return those securities.
In repurchase transactions, typically, the termination date for a repurchase agreement is before the maturity date of the underlying security. However, in certain situations, the Corporation may enter into repurchase agreements where the termination date of the repurchase transaction is the same as the maturity date of the underlying security and these transactions are referred to as
 
repo-to-maturity (RTM) transactions. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Corporation accounts for RTM transactions as sales and purchases when the transferred securities are highly liquid. In instances where securities are considered sold or purchased, the Corporation removes or recognizes the securities from the Consolidated Balance Sheet and, in the case of sales recognizes a gain or loss in the Consolidated Statement of Income. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, the Corporation had no outstanding RTM transactions that had been accounted for as sales and an immaterial amount of transactions that had been accounted for as purchases.
Collateral
The Corporation accepts securities as collateral that it is permitted by contract or custom to sell or repledge. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, the fair value of this collateral was
$393.9 billion
and
$401.7 billion
of which
$287.7 billion
and
$257.6 billion
was sold or repledged. The primary sources of this collateral are repurchase agreements and securities borrowed. The Corporation also pledges firm-owned securities and loans as collateral in transactions that include repurchase agreements, securities loaned, public and trust deposits, U.S. Treasury tax and loan notes, and other short-term borrowings. This collateral, which in some cases can be sold or repledged by the counterparties to the transactions, is parenthetically disclosed on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
In certain cases, the Corporation has transferred assets to consolidated VIEs where those restricted assets serve as collateral for the interests issued by the VIEs. These assets are disclosed on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as Assets of Consolidated VIEs.
In addition, the Corporation obtains collateral in connection with its derivative contracts. Required collateral levels vary depending on the credit risk rating and the type of counterparty. Generally, the Corporation accepts collateral in the form of cash, U.S. Treasury securities and other marketable securities. Based on provisions contained in legal netting agreements, the Corporation nets cash collateral against the applicable derivative fair value. The Corporation also pledges collateral on its own derivative positions which can be applied against derivative liabilities.
Trading Instruments
Financial instruments utilized in trading activities are carried at fair value. Fair value is generally based on quoted market prices or quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities. If these market prices are not available, fair values are estimated based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques where the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in trading account profits (losses).
Derivatives and Hedging Activities
Derivatives are entered into on behalf of customers, for trading, as economic hedges or as qualifying accounting hedges. Derivatives utilized by the Corporation include swaps, financial futures and forward settlement contracts, and option contracts. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. Financial futures and forward settlement
contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a financial instrument, index, currency or commodity at a predetermined future date, and rate or price. An option contract is an agreement that conveys to the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a financial instrument (including another derivative financial instrument), index, currency or commodity at a predetermined rate or price during a period or at a date in the future. Option agreements can be transacted on organized exchanges or directly between parties.
All derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Corporation to settle positive and negative positions and offset cash collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis. For exchange-traded contracts, fair value is based on quoted market prices. For non-exchange traded contracts, fair value is based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation.
Valuations of derivative assets and liabilities reflect the value of the instrument including counterparty credit risk. These values also take into account the Corporations own credit standing, thus including in the valuation of the derivative instrument the value of the net credit differential between the counterparties to the derivative contract.
Trading Derivatives and Economic Hedges
Derivatives held for trading purposes are included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities with changes in fair value included in trading account profits (losses).
Derivatives used as economic hedges, because either they did not qualify for or were not designated as an accounting hedge, are also included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that serve as economic hedges of mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and first mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS) that are originated by the Corporation are recorded in mortgage banking income. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that serve as economic hedges of credit exposures, interest rate risk and foreign currency exposures are included in other income (loss). Credit derivatives used by the Corporation as economic hedges do not qualify as accounting hedges but can protect the Corporation from various credit exposures as economic hedges, and changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in other income (loss).
Derivatives Used For Hedge Accounting Purposes (Accounting Hedges)
For accounting hedges, the Corporation formally documents at inception all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various accounting hedges. Additionally, the Corporation primarily uses regression analysis at the inception of a hedge and for each reporting period thereafter to assess whether the derivative used in a hedging transaction is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item. The Corporation discontinues hedge accounting when it is determined that a derivative is not expected to be or has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge, and then reflects changes in fair value of the derivative in earnings after termination of the hedge relationship.
 
The Corporation uses its accounting hedges as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The Corporation manages interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity predominantly through the use of derivatives. Fair value hedges are used to protect against changes in the fair value of the Corporations assets and liabilities that are attributable to interest rate or foreign exchange volatility. Cash flow hedges are used primarily to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions caused by interest rate or foreign exchange fluctuations. For terminated cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately
25
years, with a substantial portion of the hedged transactions being less than
10
years. For open or future cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are or will be hedged is less than
seven
years.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings, together and in the same income statement line item with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) and are reclassified into the line item in the income statement in which the hedged item is recorded and in the same period the hedged item affects earnings. Hedge ineffectiveness and gains and losses on the excluded component of a derivative in assessing hedge effectiveness are recorded in earnings in the same income statement line item. The Corporation records changes in the fair value of derivatives used as hedges of the net investment in foreign operations, to the extent effective, as a component of accumulated OCI.
If a derivative instrument in a fair value hedge is terminated or the hedge designation removed, the previous adjustments to the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability are subsequently accounted for in the same manner as other components of the carrying amount of that asset or liability. For interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, such adjustments are amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the respective asset or liability. If a derivative instrument in a cash flow hedge is terminated or the hedge designation is removed, related amounts in accumulated OCI are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. If it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, any related amounts in accumulated OCI are reclassified into earnings in that period.
Interest Rate Lock Commitments
The Corporation enters into IRLCs in connection with its mortgage banking activities to fund residential mortgage loans at specified times in the future. IRLCs that relate to the origination of mortgage loans that will be held-for-sale are considered derivative instruments under applicable accounting guidance. As such, these IRLCs are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in mortgage banking income.
In estimating the fair value of an IRLC, the Corporation assigns a probability to the loan commitment based on an expectation that it will be exercised and the loan will be funded. The fair value of the commitments is derived from the fair value of related mortgage loans which is based on observable market data and includes the expected net future cash flows related to servicing of the loans. Changes to the fair value of IRLCs are recognized based on interest rate changes, changes in the probability that the commitment will
be exercised and the passage of time. Changes from the expected future cash flows related to the customer relationship are excluded from the valuation of IRLCs.
Outstanding IRLCs expose the Corporation to the risk that the price of the loans underlying the commitments might decline from inception of the rate lock to funding of the loan. To protect against this risk, the Corporation utilizes forward loan sales commitments and other derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps and options, to economically hedge the risk of potential changes in the value of the loans that would result from the commitments. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in mortgage banking income.
Securities
Debt securities are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of their trade date. Debt securities bought principally with the intent to buy and sell in the short term as part of the Corporations trading activities are reported at fair value in trading account assets with unrealized gains and losses included in trading account profits (losses). Debt securities purchased for longer term investment purposes, as part of asset and liability management (ALM) and other strategic activities, are reported at fair value with net unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated OCI and presented as available-for-sale (AFS) securities. Certain debt securities which management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity (HTM) are reported at amortized cost and presented as HTM securities. Other debt securities purchased as economic hedges are reported in other assets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in the same line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income as unrealized gains and losses on the item being hedged are reported.
The Corporation regularly evaluates each AFS and HTM debt security where the value has declined below amortized cost to assess whether the decline in fair value is other-than-temporary. In determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, the Corporation considers the severity and duration of the decline in fair value, the length of time expected for recovery, the financial condition of the issuer, and other qualitative factors, as well as whether the Corporation either plans to sell the security or it is more-likely-than-not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost. If the impairment of the AFS or HTM debt security is credit-related, an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) is recorded in earnings. For AFS debt securities, the non-credit-related impairment is recognized in accumulated OCI. If the Corporation intends to sell an AFS debt security or believes it will more-likely-than-not be required to sell a security, the Corporation records the full amount of the impairment as an OTTI.
Interest on debt securities, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, is included in interest income. Realized gains and losses from the sales of debt securities, which are included in gains (losses) on sales of debt securities, are determined using the specific identification method.
Marketable equity securities are classified based on managements intention on the date of purchase and recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the trade date. Marketable equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of resale in the near term are classified as trading and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in trading account profits (losses). Other marketable equity securities are accounted for as AFS and classified in other assets. All AFS marketable equity securities are carried at fair value with
 
net unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated OCI on an after-tax basis. If there is an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of any individual AFS marketable equity security, the cost basis is reduced and the Corporation reclassifies the associated net unrealized loss out of accumulated OCI with a corresponding charge to equity investment income. Dividend income on AFS marketable equity securities is included in equity investment income. Realized gains and losses on the sale of all AFS marketable equity securities, which are recorded in equity investment income, are determined using the specific identification method.
Certain equity investments held by Global Principal Investments (GPI), the Corporations diversified equity investor in private equity, real estate and other alternative investments, are subject to investment company accounting under applicable accounting guidance, and accordingly, are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in equity investment income. These investments are included in other assets. Initially, the transaction price of the investment is generally considered to be the best indicator of fair value. Thereafter, valuation of direct investments is based on an assessment of each individual investment using methodologies that include publicly-traded comparables derived by multiplying a key performance metric (e.g., earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of the portfolio company by the relevant valuation multiple observed for comparable companies, acquisition comparables, entry level multiples and discounted cash flows, and are subject to appropriate discounts for lack of liquidity or marketability. Certain factors that may influence changes in fair value include but are not limited to recapitalizations, subsequent rounds of financing and offerings in the equity or debt capital markets. For fund investments, the Corporation generally records the fair value of its proportionate interest in the funds capital as reported by the funds respective managers.
Other investments held by GPI are accounted for under either the equity method or at cost, depending on the Corporations ownership interest, and are reported in other assets.
Loans and Leases
Loans measured at historical cost are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income, charge-offs, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans, and for purchased loans, net of any unamortized premiums or discounts. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as adjustments to interest income over the lives of the related loans. Unearned income, discounts and premiums are amortized to interest income using a level yield methodology. The Corporation elects to account for certain loans under the fair value option with changes in fair value reported in other income for consumer and commercial loans.
Under applicable accounting guidance, for reporting purposes, the loan and lease portfolio is categorized by portfolio segment and, within each portfolio segment, by class of financing receivables. A portfolio segment is defined as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses, and a class of financing receivables is defined as the level of disaggregation of portfolio segments based on the initial measurement attribute, risk characteristics and methods for assessing risk. The Corporations three portfolio segments are home loans, credit card and other consumer, and commercial. The classes within the home loans
portfolio segment are core portfolio residential mortgage, Legacy Assets & Servicing residential mortgage, Countrywide Financial Corporation (Countrywide) residential mortgage purchased credit-impaired (PCI), core portfolio home equity, Legacy Assets & Servicing home equity, Countrywide home equity PCI, Legacy Assets & Servicing discontinued real estate and Countrywide discontinued real estate PCI
.
The classes within the credit card and other consumer portfolio segment are U.S. credit card, non-U.S. credit card, direct/indirect consumer and other consumer. The classes within the commercial portfolio segment are U.S. commercial, commercial real estate, commercial lease financing, non-U.S. commercial and U.S. small business commercial.
Purchased Credit-impaired Loans
The Corporation purchases loans with and without evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination. Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include statistics such as past due status, refreshed borrower credit scores and refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, some of which are not immediately available as of the purchase date. Purchased loans with evidence of credit quality deterioration for which it is probable that the Corporation will not receive all contractually required payments receivable are accounted for as PCI loans. The excess of the cash flows expected to be collected on PCI loans, measured as of the acquisition date, over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan using a level yield methodology. The difference between contractually required payments as of the acquisition date and the cash flows expected to be collected is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. PCI loans that have similar risk characteristics, primarily credit risk, collateral type and interest rate risk, are pooled and accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows.
The Corporation continues to estimate cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the loan using internal credit risk, interest rate and prepayment risk models that incorporate managements best estimate of current key assumptions such as default rates, loss severity and payment speeds. If, upon subsequent evaluation, the Corporation determines it is probable that the present value of the expected cash flows have decreased, the PCI loan is considered further impaired resulting in a charge to the provision for credit losses and a corresponding increase to a valuation allowance included in the allowance for loan and lease losses. If, upon subsequent evaluation, it is probable that there is an increase in the present value of the expected cash flows, the Corporation reduces any remaining valuation allowance. If there is no remaining valuation allowance, the Corporation recalculates the amount of accretable yield as the excess of the revised expected cash flows over the current carrying value resulting in a reclassification from nonaccretable difference to accretable yield. The present value of the expected cash flows is determined using the PCI loans effective interest rate, adjusted for changes in the PCI loans interest rate indexes.
Loan disposals, which may include sales of loans, receipt of payments in full from the borrower or foreclosure, result in removal of the loan from the PCI loan pool. Write-downs are not recorded on the PCI loan pool until actual losses exceed the remaining nonaccretable difference. To date, no write-downs have been recorded for any of the PCI loan pools.
 
Leases
The Corporation provides equipment financing to its customers through a variety of lease arrangements. Direct financing leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus estimated residual value of the leased property less unearned income. Leveraged leases, which are a form of financing leases, are carried net of nonrecourse debt. Unearned income on leveraged and direct financing leases is accreted to interest income over the lease terms using methods that approximate the interest method.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, represents managements estimate of probable losses inherent in the Corporations lending activities. The allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments exclude amounts for loans and unfunded lending commitments accounted for under the fair value option as the fair values of these instruments reflect a credit component. The allowance for loan and lease losses does not include amounts related to accrued interest receivable other than billed interest and fees on credit card receivables as accrued interest receivable is reversed when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status. The allowance for loan and lease losses represents the estimated probable credit losses on funded consumer and commercial loans and leases while the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, including standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and binding unfunded loan commitments, represents estimated probable credit losses on these unfunded credit instruments based on utilization assumptions. Credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible, excluding derivative assets, trading account assets and loans carried at fair value, are charged against these accounts. Cash recovered on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to these accounts. Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses based on the combined total of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments.
The Corporation performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its lending portfolios to identify credit risks and to assess the overall collectability of those portfolios. The allowance on certain homogeneous consumer loan portfolios, which generally consist of consumer real estate within the home loans portfolio segment and credit card loans within the credit card and other consumer portfolio segment, is based on aggregated portfolio segment evaluations generally by product type. Loss forecast models are utilized for these portfolios which consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, bankruptcies, economic conditions and credit scores.
The Corporations home loans portfolio segment is comprised primarily of large groups of homogeneous consumer loans secured by residential real estate. The amount of losses incurred in the homogeneous loan pools is estimated based upon how many of the loans will default and the loss in the event of default. Using statistically valid modeling methodologies, the Corporation estimates how many of the homogeneous loans will default based on the individual loans attributes aggregated into pools of homogeneous loans with similar attributes. The attributes that are most significant to the probability of default and are used to
estimate default include refreshed LTV or in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed combined loan-to-value (CLTV), borrower credit score, months since origination (referred to as vintage) and geography, all of which are further broken down by present collection status (whether the loan is current, delinquent, in default or in bankruptcy). This estimate is based on the Corporations historical experience with the loan portfolio. The estimate is adjusted to reflect an assessment of environmental factors not yet reflected in the historical data underlying the loss estimates, such as changes in real estate values, local and national economies, underwriting standards and the regulatory environment. The probability of default on a loan is based on an analysis of the movement of loans with the measured attributes from either current, or any of the delinquency categories, to default over a twelve-month period. On home equity loans where the Corporation holds only a second-lien position and foreclosure is not the best alternative, the loss severity is estimated at
100
percent.
The allowance on certain commercial loans (except business card and certain small business loans) is calculated using loss rates delineated by risk rating and product type. Factors considered when assessing loss rates include the value of the underlying collateral, if applicable, the industry of the obligor, and the obligors liquidity and other financial indicators along with certain qualitative factors. These statistical models are updated regularly for changes in economic and business conditions. Included in the analysis of consumer and commercial loan portfolios are reserves which are maintained to cover uncertainties that affect the Corporations estimate of probable losses including domestic and global economic uncertainty and large single name defaults.
The remaining commercial portfolios, including nonperforming commercial loans, as well as consumer real estate loans modified in a TDR, renegotiated credit card, unsecured consumer and small business loans are reviewed in accordance with applicable accounting guidance on impaired loans and TDRs. If necessary, a specific allowance is established for these loans if they are deemed to be impaired. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due, including principal and/or interest, according to the contractual terms of the agreement, and once a loan has been identified as impaired, management measures impairment. Impaired loans and TDRs are primarily measured based on the present value of payments expected to be received, discounted at the loans original effective contractual interest rates, or discounted at the portfolio average contractual annual percentage rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring for the renegotiated TDR portfolio. Impaired loans and TDRs may also be measured based on observable market prices, or for loans that are solely dependent on the collateral for repayment, the estimated fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell. If the recorded investment in impaired loans exceeds this amount, a specific allowance is established as a component of the allowance for loan and lease losses unless these are consumer real estate loans that are solely dependent on the collateral for repayment, in which case the initial amount that exceeds the fair value of the collateral is charged off.
Generally, when determining the fair value of the collateral securing consumer loans that are solely dependent on the collateral for repayment, prior to performing a detailed property valuation including a walk-through of a property, the Corporation initially estimates the fair value of the collateral securing consumer loans that are solely dependent on the collateral for repayment
 
using an automated valuation method (AVM). An AVM is a tool that estimates the value of a property by reference to market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to the Metropolitan Statistical Area in which the property being valued is located. In the event that an AVM value is not available, the Corporation utilizes publicized indices or if these methods provide less reliable valuations, the Corporation uses appraisals or broker price opinions to estimate the fair value of the collateral. While there is inherent imprecision in these valuations, the Corporation believes that they are representative of the portfolio in the aggregate.
In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, the Corporation also estimates probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit and financial guarantees, and binding unfunded loan commitments. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments excludes commitments accounted for under the fair value option. Unfunded lending commitments are subject to individual reviews and are analyzed and segregated by risk according to the Corporations internal risk rating scale. These risk classifications, in conjunction with an analysis of historical loss experience, utilization assumptions, current economic conditions, performance trends within the portfolio and any other pertinent information, result in the estimation of the reserve for unfunded lending commitments.
The allowance for credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolio is reported separately on the Consolidated Balance Sheet whereas the reserve for unfunded lending commitments is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The provision for credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
Nonperforming Loans and Leases, Charge-offs and Delinquencies
Nonperforming loans and leases generally include loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status including nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Loans accounted for under the fair value option, PCI loans and LHFS are not reported as nonperforming loans and leases.
In accordance with the Corporations policies, credit card loans where the borrower is not deceased or in bankruptcy and unsecured consumer loans are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes
180
days past due. The outstanding balance of real estate-secured loans that is in excess of the estimated property value, less estimated costs to sell, is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes
180
days past due unless repayment of the loan is insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or through individually insured long-term standby agreements with Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) (the fully-insured portfolio). The estimated property value, less estimated costs to sell, is determined using the same process as described for impaired loans in the Allowance for Credit Losses section of this Note on page
13
. Personal property-secured loans are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes
120
days past due. Unsecured accounts associated with borrowers who became deceased or are in bankruptcy, including credit cards, are charged off
60
days after receipt of notification. For secured products, accounts in bankruptcy are written down to the collateral
value, less costs to sell, by the end of the month in which the account becomes
60
days past due. Consumer credit card loans, consumer loans secured by personal property and unsecured consumer loans are not placed on nonaccrual status prior to charge-off and therefore are not reported as nonperforming loans. Real estate-secured loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming at
90
days past due. However, consumer loans secured by real estate in the fully-insured portfolio are not placed on nonaccrual status, and therefore, are not reported as nonperforming loans. Accrued interest receivable is reversed when a consumer loan is placed on nonaccrual status. Interest collections on nonaccruing consumer loans for which the ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are applied as principal reductions; otherwise, such collections are credited to interest income when received. These loans may be restored to accrual status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection.
Consumer loans whose contractual terms have been modified in a TDR and are current at the time of restructuring remain on accrual status if there is demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and payment in full under the restructured terms is expected. Otherwise, the loans are placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming until there is sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period, generally
six
months. Consumer TDRs that are on accrual status are reported as performing TDRs through the end of the calendar year in which the restructuring occurred or the year in which the loans are returned to accrual status. In addition, if accruing consumer TDRs bear less than a market rate of interest at the time of modification, they are reported as performing TDRs throughout their remaining lives unless and until they cease to perform in accordance with their modified contractual terms, at which time they would be placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming TDRs.
Commercial loans and leases, excluding business card loans, that are past due
90
days or more as to principal or interest, or where reasonable doubt exists as to timely collection, including loans that are individually identified as being impaired, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming unless well-secured and in the process of collection. Commercial loans and leases whose contractual terms have been modified in a TDR are typically placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming until the loans have performed for an adequate period of time under the restructured agreement, generally
six
months. If the borrower had demonstrated performance under the previous terms and the underwriting process shows the capacity to continue to perform under the modified terms, the loans and leases may remain on accrual status. Accruing commercial TDRs are reported as performing TDRs through the end of the calendar year in which the loans are returned to accrual status. In addition, if accruing commercial TDRs bear less than a market rate of interest at the time of modification, they are reported as performing TDRs throughout their remaining lives unless and until they cease to perform in accordance with their modified contractual terms, at which time they would be placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming TDRs.
Accrued interest receivable is reversed when a commercial loan is placed on nonaccrual status. Interest collections on nonaccruing
 
commercial loans and leases for which the ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are applied as principal reductions; otherwise, such collections are credited to income when received. Commercial loans and leases may be restored to accrual status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. Business card loans are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes
180
days past due or
60
days after receipt of notification of death or bankruptcy filing. These loans are not placed on nonaccrual status prior to charge-off and therefore are not reported as nonperforming loans. Other commercial loans are generally charged off when all or a portion of the principal amount is determined to be uncollectible.
The entire balance of a consumer and commercial loan is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the specified due date on the customers billing statement. Interest and fees continue to accrue on past due loans until the date the loan goes into nonaccrual status, if applicable.
PCI loans are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. Although the PCI loans may be contractually delinquent, the Corporation does not classify these loans as nonperforming as the loans were written down to fair value at the acquisition date and the accretable yield is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan. In addition, reported net charge-offs exclude write-downs on PCI loan pools as the fair value already considers the estimated credit losses.
Loans Held-for-sale
Loans that are intended to be sold in the foreseeable future, including residential mortgages, loan syndications, and to a lesser degree, commercial real estate, consumer finance and other loans, are reported as LHFS and are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. The Corporation accounts for certain LHFS, including first mortgage LHFS, under the fair value option. Mortgage loan origination costs related to LHFS that the Corporation accounts for under the fair value option are recognized in noninterest expense when incurred. Mortgage loan origination costs for LHFS carried at the lower of cost or fair value are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the loans and recognized as a reduction of mortgage banking income upon the sale of such loans. LHFS that are on nonaccrual status and are reported as nonperforming, as defined in the policy above, are reported separately from nonperforming loans and leases.
Premises and Equipment
Premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated lives range up to
40
 years for buildings, up to
12
 years for furniture and equipment, and the shorter of lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold improvements.
The Corporation capitalizes the costs associated with certain computer hardware, software and internally developed software, and amortizes the costs over the expected useful life. Direct project costs of internally developed software are capitalized when it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used for its intended function.
Mortgage Servicing Rights
The Corporation accounts for consumer-related MSRs at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in mortgage banking income, while commercial-related and residential reverse mortgage MSRs are accounted for using the amortization method (lower of amortized cost or fair value) with impairment recognized as a reduction in mortgage banking income. To reduce the volatility of earnings related to interest rate and market value fluctuations, U.S. Treasury securities, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and derivatives such as options and interest rate swaps may be used as economic hedges of the MSRs, but are not designated as accounting hedges. These economic hedges are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in mortgage banking income.
The Corporation estimates the fair value of the consumer MSRs using a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. This is accomplished through an option-adjusted spread (OAS) valuation approach that factors in prepayment risk. This approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted discount rates. The key economic assumptions used in valuations of MSRs include weighted-average lives of the MSRs and the OAS levels. The OAS represents the spread that is added to the discount rate so that the sum of the discounted cash flows equals the market price, therefore it is a measure of the extra yield over the reference discount factor that the Corporation expects to earn by holding the asset. These variables can, and generally do, change from quarter to quarter as market conditions and projected interest rates change, and could have an adverse impact on the value of the MSRs and could result in a corresponding reduction in mortgage banking income.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill is the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment, at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit, as defined under applicable accounting guidance, is a business segment or one level below a business segment. The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step test. During 2011, the Corporation early adopted new accounting guidance that simplifies goodwill impairment testing by permitting entities to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is likely that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. For additional information, see New Accounting Pronouncements in this Note on page
9
. The first step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired; however, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step must be performed to measure potential impairment.
The second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated possible impairment. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination, which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in the first step, over the aggregate fair values of the assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business
 
combination. Measurement of the fair values of the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit is consistent with the requirements of the fair value measurements accounting guidance, which defines fair value as an exit price, meaning the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The adjustments to measure the assets, liabilities and intangibles at fair value are for the purpose of measuring the implied fair value of goodwill and such adjustments are not reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. An impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. An impairment loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill and subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment losses are not permitted under applicable accounting guidance.
For intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying amount of the intangible asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset.
Variable Interest Entities
A VIE is an entity that lacks equity investors or whose equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest in the entity through their equity investments. The entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. The Corporation is deemed to have a controlling financial interest and is the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. On a quarterly basis, the Corporation reassesses whether it has a controlling financial interest in and is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The quarterly reassessment process considers whether the Corporation has acquired or divested the power to direct the activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. The reassessment also considers whether the Corporation has acquired or disposed of a financial interest that could be significant to the VIE, or whether an interest in the VIE has become significant or is no longer significant. The consolidation status of the VIEs with which the Corporation is involved may change as a result of such reassessments. Changes in consolidation status are applied prospectively, with assets and liabilities of a newly consolidated VIE initially recorded at fair value. A gain or loss may be recognized upon deconsolidation of a VIE depending on the carrying amounts of deconsolidated assets and liabilities compared to the fair value of retained interests and ongoing contractual arrangements.
The Corporation primarily uses VIEs for its securitization activities, in which the Corporation transfers whole loans or debt securities into a trust or other vehicle such that the assets are legally isolated from the creditors of the Corporation. Assets held in a trust can only be used to settle obligations of the trust. The creditors of these trusts typically have no recourse to the Corporation except in accordance with the Corporations obligations under standard representations and warranties.
When the Corporation is the servicer of whole loans held in a securitization trust, including non-agency residential mortgages, home equity loans, credit cards, automobile loans and student loans, the Corporation has the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust. The Corporation does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of a residential mortgage agency trust unless the Corporation holds substantially all of the issued securities and has the unilateral right to liquidate the trust. The power to direct the most significant activities of a commercial mortgage securitization trust is typically held by the special servicer or by the party holding specific subordinate securities which embody certain controlling rights. The Corporation consolidates a whole-loan securitization trust if it has the power to direct the most significant activities and also holds securities issued by the trust or has other contractual arrangements, other than standard representations and warranties, that could potentially be significant to the trust.
The Corporation may also transfer trading account securities and AFS securities into municipal bond or resecuritization trusts. The Corporation consolidates a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if it has control over the ongoing activities of the trust such as the remarketing of the trusts liabilities or, if there are no ongoing activities, sole discretion over the design of the trust, including the identification of securities to be transferred in and the structure of securities to be issued, and also retains securities or has liquidity or other commitments that could potentially be significant to the trust. The Corporation does not consolidate a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if one or a limited number of third-party investors share responsibility for the design of the trust or have control over the significant activities of the trust through liquidation or other substantive rights.
Other VIEs used by the Corporation include collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), investment vehicles created on behalf of customers and other investment vehicles. The Corporation does not routinely serve as collateral manager for CDOs and, therefore, does not typically have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of a CDO. However, following an event of default, if the Corporation is a majority holder of senior securities issued by a CDO and acquires the power to manage the assets of the CDO, the Corporation consolidates the CDO.
The Corporation consolidates a customer or other investment vehicle if it has control over the initial design of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicle and also absorbs potentially significant gains or losses through an investment in the vehicle, derivative contracts or other arrangements. The Corporation does not consolidate an investment vehicle if a single investor controlled the initial design of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicles or if the Corporation does not have a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the vehicle.
Retained interests in securitized assets are initially recorded at fair value. In addition, the Corporation may invest in debt securities issued by unconsolidated VIEs. Quoted market prices are primarily used to obtain fair values of these debt securities, which are AFS debt securities or trading account assets. Generally, quoted market prices for retained residual interests are not available, therefore, the Corporation estimates fair values based on the present value of the associated expected future cash flows. This may require management to estimate credit losses, prepayment speeds, forward interest yield curves, discount rates and other factors that impact the value of retained interests. Retained residual interests in unconsolidated securitization trusts
 
are classified in trading account assets or other assets with changes in fair value recorded in income. The Corporation may also enter into derivatives with unconsolidated VIEs, which are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in income.
Fair Value
The Corporation measures the fair values of its financial instruments in accordance with accounting guidance that requires an entity to base fair value on exit price, and maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to determine the exit price. Under applicable accounting guidance, the Corporation categorizes its financial instruments, based on the priority of inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level hierarchy, as described below. Trading account assets and liabilities, derivative assets and liabilities, AFS debt and marketable equity securities, MSRs and certain other assets are carried at fair value in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. The Corporation has also elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option, including certain corporate loans and loan commitments, LHFS, other short-term borrowings, securities financing agreements, asset-backed secured financings, long-term deposits and long-term debt. The following describes the three-level hierarchy.
CDOs where independent pricing information cannot be obtained for a significant portion of the underlying assets.
Income Taxes
There are two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense approximates taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. These gross deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax attributes such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts management concludes are more-likely-than-not to be realized.
Income tax benefits are recognized and measured based upon a two-step model: 1) a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits in order to be recognized, and 2) the benefit is measured as the largest dollar amount of that position that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon settlement. The difference between the benefit recognized and the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit (UTB). The Corporation records income tax-related interest and penalties, if applicable, within income tax expense.
Retirement Benefits
The Corporation has established retirement plans covering substantially all full-time and certain part-time employees. Pension expense under these plans is charged to current operations and consists of several components of net pension cost based on various actuarial assumptions regarding future experience under the plans.
In addition, the Corporation has established unfunded supplemental benefit plans and supplemental executive retirement plans (SERPs) for selected officers of the Corporation and its subsidiaries that provide benefits that cannot be paid from a qualified retirement plan due to Internal Revenue Code restrictions. The Corporations current executive officers do not earn additional retirement income under SERPs. These plans are nonqualified under the Internal Revenue Code and assets used to fund benefit payments are not segregated from other assets of the Corporation; therefore, in general, a participants or beneficiarys claim to benefits under these plans is as a general creditor. In addition, the Corporation has established several postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefit plans.
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
The Corporation records unrealized gains and losses on AFS debt and marketable equity securities, gains and losses on cash flow accounting hedges, unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, transition obligation and prior service costs on pension and postretirement plans, foreign currency translation adjustments and related hedges of net investments in foreign operations in accumulated OCI, net-of-tax. Unrealized gains and losses on AFS debt and marketable equity securities are reclassified to earnings as the gains or losses are realized upon sale of the securities. Unrealized losses on AFS securities deemed to represent OTTI are
 
reclassified to earnings at the time of the impairment charge. For AFS debt securities that the Corporation does not intend to sell or it is not more-likely-than-not that it will be required to sell, only the credit component of an unrealized loss is reclassified to earnings. Gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges are reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Translation gains or losses on foreign currency translation adjustments are reclassified to earnings upon the substantial sale or liquidation of investments in foreign operations.
Revenue Recognition
The following summarizes the Corporations revenue recognition policies as they relate to certain noninterest income line items in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
Card income is derived from fees such as interchange, cash advance, annual, late, over-limit and other miscellaneous fees, which are recorded as revenue when earned, primarily on an accrual basis. Uncollected fees are included in the customer card receivables balances with an amount recorded in the allowance for loan and lease losses for estimated uncollectible card receivables. Uncollected fees are written off when a card receivable reaches
180
days past due.
Service charges include fees for insufficient funds, overdrafts and other banking services and are recorded as revenue when earned. Uncollected fees are included in outstanding loan balances with an amount recorded for estimated uncollectible service fees receivable. Uncollected fees are written off when a fee receivable reaches
60
days past due.
Investment and brokerage services revenue consists primarily of asset management fees and brokerage income that is recognized over the period the services are provided or when commissions are earned. Asset management fees consist primarily of fees for investment management and trust services and are generally based on the dollar amount of the assets being managed. Brokerage income is generally derived from commissions and fees earned on the sale of various financial products.
Investment banking income consists primarily of advisory and underwriting fees that are recognized in income as the services are provided and no contingencies exist. Revenues are generally recognized net of any direct expenses. Non-reimbursed expenses are recorded as noninterest expense.
Earnings Per Common Share
Earnings per common share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income (loss) allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average common shares outstanding, except that it does not include unvested common shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. Net income (loss) allocated to common shareholders represents net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders which is net income (loss) adjusted for preferred stock dividends including dividends declared, accretion of discounts on preferred stock including accelerated accretion when preferred stock is repaid early, and cumulative dividends related to the current dividend period that have not been declared as of period end, less income allocated to participating securities (see below for additional information). Diluted EPS is computed by dividing income (loss) allocated to common shareholders plus dividends on dilutive convertible preferred stock and preferred stock that can be tendered to exercise warrants by the weighted-average
common shares outstanding plus amounts representing the dilutive effect of stock options outstanding, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), outstanding warrants and the dilution resulting from the conversion of convertible preferred stock, if applicable. Certain warrants may be exercised, at the option of the holder, through tendering of the Corporations 6% Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series T (the Series T Preferred Stock) or cash. Because it is currently more economical for the warrant holder to tender the Series T preferred stock, the common shares underlying these warrants are considered outstanding and the dividends on the preferred stock are added back to income (loss) allocable to common shareholders in computing diluted EPS, unless the effect is antidilutive.
Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities that are included in computing EPS using the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula under which EPS is calculated for common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared and participating rights in undistributed earnings. Under this method, all earnings, distributed and undistributed, are allocated to participating securities and common shares based on their respective rights to receive dividends.
In an exchange of non-convertible preferred stock, income allocated to common shareholders is adjusted for the difference between the carrying value of the preferred stock and the fair value of the consideration exchanged. In an induced conversion of convertible preferred stock, income allocated to common shareholders is reduced by the excess of the fair value of the consideration exchanged over the fair value of the common stock that would have been issued under the original conversion terms.
Foreign Currency Translation
Assets, liabilities and operations of foreign branches and subsidiaries are recorded based on the functional currency of each entity. For certain of the foreign operations, the functional currency is the local currency, in which case the assets, liabilities and operations are translated, for consolidation purposes, from the local currency to the U.S. dollar reporting currency at period-end rates for assets and liabilities and generally at average rates for results of operations. The resulting unrealized gains or losses as well as gains and losses from certain hedges, are reported as a component of accumulated OCI on an after-tax basis. When the foreign entitys functional currency is determined to be the U.S. dollar, the resulting remeasurement currency gains or losses on
 
foreign currency-denominated assets or liabilities are included in earnings.
Credit Card and Deposit Arrangements
Endorsing Organization Agreements
The Corporation contracts with other organizations to obtain their endorsement of the Corporations loan and deposit products. This endorsement may provide to the Corporation exclusive rights to market to the organizations members or to customers on behalf of the Corporation. These organizations endorse the Corporations loan and deposit products and provide the Corporation with their mailing lists and marketing activities. These agreements generally have terms that range from
two
to
five
years. The Corporation typically pays royalties in exchange for the endorsement. Compensation costs related to the credit card agreements are recorded as contra-revenue in card income.
Cardholder Reward Agreements
The Corporation offers reward programs that allow its cardholders to earn points that can be redeemed for a broad range of rewards including cash, travel and discounted products. The Corporation establishes a rewards liability based upon the points earned that are expected to be redeemed and the average cost per point redeemed. The points to be redeemed are estimated based on past redemption behavior, card product type, account transaction activity and other historical card performance. The liability is reduced as the points are redeemed. The estimated cost of the rewards programs is recorded as contra-revenue in card income.
Insurance Income and Insurance Expense
Property and casualty and credit life and disability premiums are generally recognized over the term of the policies on a pro-rata basis for all policies except for certain of the lender-placed auto insurance and the guaranteed auto protection (GAP) policies. For lender-placed auto insurance, premiums are recognized when collections become probable due to high cancellation rates experienced early in the life of the policy. For GAP insurance, revenue recognition is correlated to the exposure and accelerated over the life of the contract. Mortgage reinsurance premiums are recognized as earned. Insurance expense includes insurance claims, commissions and premium taxes, all of which are recorded in other general operating expense.
NOTE 2 
Merger and Restructuring Activity
Merger and restructuring charges are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income and include incremental costs to integrate the operations of the Corporation and its most recent acquisitions. These charges represent costs associated with these activities and do not represent ongoing costs of the fully integrated combined organization. The merger and restructuring charges table presents the components of merger and restructuring charges.
For
2011
, all merger-related charges related to the Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (Merrill Lynch) acquisition. Included for
2010
and
2009
are merger-related charges of
$1.6 billion
and
$1.8 billion
related to the Merrill Lynch acquisition and
$202 million
and
$940 million
related to earlier acquisitions.
 
The restructuring reserves table presents the changes in restructuring reserves for
2011
and
2010
. Restructuring reserves are established by a charge to merger and restructuring charges, and the restructuring charges are included in the merger and restructuring charges table. Substantially all of the amounts in the restructuring reserves table relate to the Merrill Lynch acquisition.
Amounts added to the restructuring reserves in
2011
and
2010
related to severance and other employee-related costs. Payments associated with the Merrill Lynch acquisition are anticipated to continue into 2012.

Trading Account Assets and Liabilities
The table below presents the components of trading account assets and liabilities at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
.
NOTE 4 
Derivatives
Derivative Balances
Derivatives are entered into on behalf of customers, for trading, as economic hedges or as qualifying accounting hedges. For additional information on the Corporations derivatives and hedging activities, see
Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Principles
. The following tables identify derivative instruments included on the Corporations Consolidated Balance Sheet in
 
derivative assets and liabilities at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty and collateral netting. Total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and have been reduced by the cash collateral applied.
ALM and Risk Management Derivatives
The Corporations ALM and risk management activities include the use of derivatives to mitigate risk to the Corporation including derivatives designated as qualifying accounting hedges and economic hedges. Interest rate, commodity, credit and foreign exchange contracts are utilized in the Corporations ALM and risk management activities.
The Corporation maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts, which are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporations goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity and volatility so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings or capital. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in fair value. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this unrealized appreciation or depreciation.
Interest rate and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Market risk is the risk that values of mortgage assets or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market
 
conditions such as interest rate movements. To hedge interest rate risk in mortgage banking production income, the Corporation utilizes forward loan sale commitments and other derivative instruments including purchased options and certain debt securities. The Corporation also utilizes derivatives such as interest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward settlement contracts and Eurodollar futures as economic hedges of the fair value of MSRs. For additional information on MSRs, see
Note 25  Mortgage Servicing Rights
.
The Corporation uses foreign currency contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities, as well as the Corporations investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Foreign exchange contracts, which include spot and forward contracts, represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date. Exposure to loss on these contracts will increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate.
The Corporation enters into derivative commodity contracts such as futures, swaps, options and forwards as well as non-derivative commodity contracts to provide price risk management services to customers or to manage price risk associated with its physical and financial commodity positions. The non-derivative
commodity contracts and physical inventories of commodities expose the Corporation to earnings volatility. Cash flow and fair value accounting hedges provide a method to mitigate a portion of this earnings volatility.
The Corporation purchases credit derivatives to manage credit risk related to certain funded and unfunded credit exposures. Credit derivatives include credit default swaps (CDS), total return swaps and swaptions. These derivatives are accounted for as economic hedges and changes in fair value are recorded in other income (loss).
Derivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges
The Corporation uses various types of interest rate, commodity and foreign exchange derivative contracts to protect against changes in the fair value of its assets and liabilities due to
 
fluctuations in interest rates, exchange rates and commodity prices (fair value hedges). The Corporation also uses these types of contracts and equity derivatives to protect against changes in the cash flows of its assets and liabilities, and other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). The Corporation hedges its net investment in consolidated non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward exchange contracts, cross-currency basis swaps, and by issuing foreign currency-denominated debt (net investment hedges).
Fair Value Hedges
The table below summarizes certain information related to the Corporations derivatives designated as fair value hedges for
2011
,
2010
and
2009
.
Cash Flow Hedges
The table below summarizes certain information related to the Corporations derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for
2011
,
2010
and
2009
. During the next 12 months, net losses in accumulated OCI of approximately
$1.5 billion
(
$1.0 billion
after-tax) on derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges are expected to be reclassified into earnings. These net losses reclassified into earnings are expected to primarily reduce net interest income related to the respective hedged items. Amounts related to commodity price risk reclassified from accumulated OCI are recorded in trading account
 
profits with the underlying hedged item. Amounts related to price risk on restricted stock awards reclassified from accumulated OCI are recorded in personnel expense. Amounts related to price risk on equity investments included in AFS securities reclassified from accumulated OCI are recorded in equity investment income with the underlying hedged item.
Amounts related to foreign exchange risk recognized in accumulated OCI on derivatives exclude gains (losses) of
$82 million
,
$192 million
and
$(387) million
related to long-term debt designated as a net investment hedge for
2011
,
2010
and
2009
.
The Corporation entered into equity total return swaps to hedge a portion of RSUs granted to certain employees as part of their compensation in prior periods. Certain awards contain clawback provisions which permit the Corporation to cancel all or a portion of the award under specified circumstances, and certain awards may be settled in cash. These RSUs are accrued as liabilities over the vesting period and adjusted to fair value based on changes in the share price of the Corporations common stock. From time to time, the Corporation may enter into equity derivatives to minimize the change in the expense to the Corporation driven by fluctuations
 
in the share price of the Corporations common stock during the vesting period of any RSUs that may be granted, if any, subject to similar or other terms and conditions. Certain of these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges of unrecognized unvested awards with the changes in fair value of the hedge recorded in accumulated OCI and reclassified into earnings in the same period as the RSUs affect earnings. The remaining derivatives are accounted for as economic hedges and changes in fair value are recorded in personnel expense. For more information on RSUs and related hedges, see
Note 20  Stock-based Compensation Plans
.
Derivatives Accounted for as Economic Hedges
Derivatives accounted for as economic hedges, because either they did not qualify for or were not designated as accounting hedges, are used by the Corporation to reduce certain risk exposures. The table below presents gains (losses) on these derivatives for
2011
,
2010
and
2009
. These gains (losses) are largely offset by the income or expense that is recorded on the economically hedged item.
Sales and Trading Revenue
The Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client transactions, for principal trading purposes, and to manage risk exposures arising from trading account assets and liabilities. It is the Corporations policy to include these derivative instruments in its trading activities which include derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments. The resulting risk from these derivatives is managed on a portfolio basis as part of the Corporations
Global Markets
business segment. The related sales and trading revenue generated within
Global Markets
is recorded in various income statement line items including trading account profits and net interest income as well as other revenue categories. However, the majority of income related to derivative instruments is recorded in trading account profits.
Sales and trading revenue includes changes in the fair value and realized gains and losses on the sales of trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Revenue is generated by the difference in the client price for an instrument and the price at which the trading desk can execute the trade in the dealer market. For equity
 
securities, commissions related to purchases and sales are recorded in other income (loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Changes in the fair value of these securities are included in trading account profits. For debt securities, revenue, with the exception of interest associated with the debt securities, is typically included in trading account profits. Unlike commissions for equity securities, the initial revenue related to broker/dealer services for debt securities is typically included in the pricing of the instrument rather than being charged through separate fee arrangements. Therefore, this revenue is recorded in trading account profits as part of the initial mark to fair value. For derivatives, all revenue is included in trading account profits. In transactions where the Corporation acts as agent, which includes exchange-traded futures and options, fees are recorded in other income (loss).
Gains (losses) on certain instruments, primarily loans, held in the
Global Markets
business segment that are not considered trading instruments are excluded from sales and trading revenue in their entirety.
The table below, which includes both derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments, identifies the amounts in the respective income statement line items attributable to the Corporations sales and trading revenue in
Global Markets
, categorized by primary risk, for
2011
,
2010
and
2009
. The difference between total trading account profits in the table below and in the Consolidated Statement of Income relates to trading activities in business segments other than
Global Markets
.
Credit Derivatives
The Corporation enters into credit derivatives primarily to facilitate client transactions and to manage credit risk exposures. Credit derivatives derive value based on an underlying third-party referenced obligation or a portfolio of referenced obligations and generally require the Corporation, as the seller of credit protection, to make payments to a buyer upon the occurrence of a pre-defined credit event. Such credit events generally include bankruptcy of
 
the referenced credit entity and failure to pay under the obligation, as well as acceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or moratorium. For credit derivatives based on a portfolio of referenced credits or credit indices, the Corporation may not be required to make payment until a specified amount of loss has occurred and/or may only be required to make payment up to a specified amount.
Credit derivative instruments where the Corporation is the seller of credit protection and their expiration at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
are summarized in the table below. These instruments are classified as investment and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the underlying reference obligation. The Corporation considers ratings of BBB- or higher as investment grade. Non-investment grade includes non-rated credit derivative instruments.
The notional amount represents the maximum amount payable by the Corporation for most credit derivatives. However, the Corporation does not solely monitor its exposure to credit derivatives based on notional amount because this measure does not take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As such, the notional amount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporations exposure to these contracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and establish limits to help ensure that certain credit risk-related losses occur within acceptable, pre-defined limits.
The Corporation economically hedges its market risk exposure to credit derivatives by entering into a variety of offsetting derivative contracts and security positions. For example, in certain instances, the Corporation may purchase credit protection with identical underlying referenced names to offset its exposure. The carrying value and notional amount of written credit derivatives for which the Corporation held purchased credit derivatives with identical underlying referenced names and terms at
December 31, 2011
was
$48.0 billion
and
$1.0 trillion
compared to
$43.7 billion
and
$1.4 trillion
at
December 31, 2010
.
Credit-related notes in the table on page
27
include investments in securities issued by CDO, collateralized loan obligation (CLO) and credit-linked note vehicles. These instruments are primarily classified as trading securities. The carrying value of these instruments equals the Corporations maximum exposure to loss. The Corporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms of the securities owned. The Corporation discloses internal categorizations of investment grade and non-investment grade consistent with how risk is managed for these instruments.
Credit-related Contingent Features and Collateral
The Corporation executes the majority of its derivative contracts in the OTC market with large, international financial institutions, including broker/dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of non-financial companies. Substantially all of the derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit rating downgrade (depending on the ultimate rating level) or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required of the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow the Corporation to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades. Further, as previously discussed on page
21
, the Corporation enters into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of certain events.
A majority of the Corporations derivative contracts contain credit risk related contingent features, primarily in the form of International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) master netting agreements and credit support documentation that enhance the creditworthiness of these instruments compared to other obligations of the respective counterparty with whom the Corporation has transacted. These contingent features may be for the benefit of the Corporation as well as its counterparties with respect to changes in the Corporations creditworthiness and the mark-to-market exposure under the derivative transactions. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, the Corporation held cash and securities collateral of
$87.7 billion
and
$86.1 billion
, and posted cash and securities collateral of
$86.5 billion
and
$66.9 billion
in the normal course of business under derivative agreements.
 
In connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide additional collateral or to terminate transactions with certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of the Corporation or certain subsidiaries. The amount of additional collateral required depends on the contract and is usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the exposure.
At
December 31, 2011
, the amount of collateral, calculated based on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and certain subsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties but had not yet posted to counterparties was approximately
$4.2 billion
. That amount includes collateral that could be required to be posted as a result of the downgrades by the rating agencies in 2011.
Some counterparties are able to unilaterally terminate certain contracts, or the Corporation or certain subsidiaries may be required to take other action such as find a suitable replacement or obtain a guarantee. At
December 31, 2011
, the current liability recorded for these derivative contracts was
$947 million
, against which the Corporation and certain subsidiaries had posted
$1.0 billion
of collateral.
In addition, under the terms of certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, in the event of a further downgrade of the Corporations or certain subsidiaries credit ratings, counterparties to those agreements may require the Corporation or certain subsidiaries to provide additional collateral, terminate these contracts or agreements, or provide other remedies. At
December 31, 2011
, if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch, the amount of additional collateral contractually required by derivative contracts and other trading agreements would have been approximately
$2.5 billion
comprised of
$2.1 billion
for BANA and approximately
$403 million
for Merrill Lynch and certain of its subsidiaries. If the agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for these entities by a second incremental notch, approximately
$2.0 billion
in additional collateral comprised of
$1.5 billion
for BANA and
$522 million
for Merrill Lynch and certain subsidiaries, would have been required.
Also, if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch, the derivative liability that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties as of
December 31, 2011
was
$2.9 billion
, against which
$2.7 billion
of collateral has been posted. If the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation and certain subsidiaries by a second incremental notch, the derivative liability that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties as of
December 31, 2011
was an incremental
$5.6 billion
, against which
$5.4 billion
of collateral has been posted.
Derivative Valuation Adjustments
The Corporation records counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on derivative assets in order to properly reflect the credit quality of the counterparties. These adjustments are necessary as the market quotes on derivatives do not fully reflect the credit risk of the counterparties to the derivative assets. The Corporation considers collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate its credit exposure to each counterparty in determining the counterparty credit risk valuation
adjustment. All or a portion of these counterparty credit valuation adjustments are subsequently adjusted due to changes in the value of the derivative contract, collateral and creditworthiness of the counterparties. During
2011
and
2010
, credit valuation gains (losses) of
$(1.9) billion
and
$731 million
(
$(606) million
and
$(8) million
, net of hedges) for counterparty credit risk related to derivative assets were recognized in trading account profits. These credit valuation adjustments were primarily related to the Corporations monoline exposure. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, the cumulative counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment
 
reduced the derivative assets balance by
$2.8 billion
and
$6.8 billion
.
In addition, the fair value of the Corporations or its subsidiaries derivative liabilities is adjusted to reflect the impact of the Corporations credit quality. During
2011
and
2010
, the Corporation recorded DVA gains of
$1.4 billion
and
$331 million
(
$1.0 billion
and
$262 million
, net of interest rate and foreign exchange hedges) in trading account profits for changes in the Corporations or its subsidiaries credit risk. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, the Corporations cumulative DVA reduced the derivative liabilities balance by
$2.4 billion
and
$1.1 billion
.
NOTE 5 
Securities
The table below presents the amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses in accumulated OCI, and fair value of debt and marketable equity securities at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
.
At
December 31, 2011
, the accumulated net unrealized gains on AFS debt securities included in accumulated OCI were
$3.1 billion
, net of the related income tax expense of
$1.9 billion
. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, the Corporation had nonperforming AFS debt securities of
$140 million
and
$44 million
.
The Corporation recorded OTTI losses on AFS debt securities for
2011
and
2010
as presented in the table below. A debt security is impaired when its fair value is less than its amortized cost. If the Corporation intends or will more-likely-than-not be required to sell the debt securities prior to recovery, the entire impairment is recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income. For debt securities the Corporation does not intend or will not more-likely-
 
than-not be required to sell, an analysis is performed to determine if any of the impairment is due to credit or whether it is due to other factors (e.g., interest rate). Credit losses are considered unrecoverable and are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income with the remaining unrealized losses recorded in accumulated OCI. In certain instances, the credit loss on a debt security may exceed the total impairment, in which case, the portion of the credit loss that exceeds the total impairment is recorded as an unrealized gain in accumulated OCI. Balances in the table below exclude
$9 million
and
$51 million
of unrealized gains recorded in accumulated OCI related to these securities for
2011
and
2010
.
The Corporations net impairment losses recognized in earnings consist of write-downs to fair value on AFS securities the Corporation has the intent to sell or will more-likely-than-not be required to sell and credit losses recognized on AFS and HTM securities the Corporation does not have the intent to sell or will not more-likely-than-not be required to sell. The table below presents a rollforward of credit losses recognized in earnings on AFS debt securities these losses as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
that the Corporation does not have the intent to sell or will not more-likely-than-not be required to sell.
The Corporation estimates the portion of loss attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model and estimates the expected cash flows of the underlying collateral using internal credit, interest rate and prepayment risk models that incorporate managements best estimate of current key assumptions such as default rates, loss severity and prepayment rates. Assumptions used can vary widely from loan to loan and are influenced by such
 
factors as loan interest rate, geographical location of the borrower, borrower characteristics and collateral type. The Corporation then determines how the underlying collateral cash flows will be distributed to each security issued from the structure. Expected principal and interest cash flows on an impaired AFS debt security are discounted using the effective yield of each individual impaired AFS debt security.
Significant assumptions used in the valuation of non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) were as follows at
December 31, 2011
.
Additionally, annual constant prepayment speed and loss severity rates are projected considering collateral characteristics such as LTV, creditworthiness of borrowers as measured using FICO scores and geographic concentrations. The weighted-average severity by collateral type was
43 percent
for prime bonds,
50 percent
for Alt-A bonds and
60 percent
for subprime bonds at
December 31, 2011
. Additionally, default rates are projected by considering collateral characteristics including, but not limited to
LTV, FICO and geographic concentration. Weighted-average life default rates by collateral type were
36 percent
for prime bonds,
62 percent
for Alt-A bonds and
72 percent
for subprime bonds at
December 31, 2011
.
 
The table below presents the fair value and the associated gross unrealized losses on AFS securities with gross unrealized losses at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, and whether these securities have had gross unrealized losses for less than twelve months or for twelve months or longer.
The amortized cost and fair value of the Corporations investment in AFS and held-to-maturity debt securities from FNMA, the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), FHLMC and U.S. Treasury securities where the investment exceeded 10 percent of consolidated shareholders equity at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
are presented in the table below.
The expected maturity distribution of the Corporations MBS and the contractual maturity distribution of the Corporations other AFS debt securities, and the yields on the Corporations AFS debt securities portfolio at
December 31, 2011
are summarized in the table below. Actual maturities may differ from the contractual or expected maturities since borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties.
The gross realized gains and losses on sales of AFS debt securities for
2011
,
2010
and
2009
are presented in the table below.
Certain Corporate and Strategic Investments
At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, the Corporation owned
2.0 billion
shares and
25.6 billion
shares representing approximately
one percent
and
10 percent
of China Construction Bank Corporation (CCB). During
2011
, the Corporation sold shares of CCB and in connection therewith recorded gains of
$6.5 billion
. Sales restrictions on the remaining
2.0 billion
CCB shares continue until August 2013 and accordingly these shares are carried at cost. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, the cost basis of the
 
Corporations total investment in CCB was
$716 million
and
$9.2 billion
, the carrying value was
$716 million
and
$19.7 billion
and the fair value was
$1.4 billion
and
$20.8 billion
. This investment is recorded in other assets. Dividend income on this investment is recorded in equity investment income and during
2011
and
2010
, the Corporation recorded dividends of
$836 million
and
$535 million
from CCB. The strategic assistance agreement between the Corporation and CCB, which includes cooperation in specific business areas, remains in place.
During
2011
, the Corporation sold its remaining ownership interest of approximately
13.6 million
preferred shares, or
seven percent
of BlackRock, Inc. The investment was recorded in other assets at cost. In connection with the sale, the Corporation recorded a gain of
$377 million
.
During
2011
, the Corporation recorded
$1.1 billion
of impairment charges on its investment in a merchant services joint venture. The joint venture had a carrying value of
$3.4 billion
and
$4.7 billion
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
with the reduction in carrying value primarily the result of the impairment charges. The impairment charges were based on the ongoing financial performance of the joint venture and updated forecasts of its long-term financial performance. For additional information, see
Note 14  Commitments and Contingencies
.
NOTE 6 
Outstanding Loans and Leases
The following tables present total outstanding loans and leases and an aging analysis at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
.
The Legacy Assets & Servicing portfolio, as shown in the table below, is a separately managed legacy mortgage portfolio. Legacy Assets & Servicing, which was created on January 1, 2011 in connection with the re-alignment of the
Consumer Real Estate Services
(
CRES)
business segment, is responsible for servicing loans on its balance sheet and for others including loans held in other business segments and
All
Other
. This includes servicing
 
and managing the runoff and exposures related to selected residential mortgages and home equity loans, including discontinued real estate products, Countrywide PCI loans and certain loans that met a pre-defined delinquency status or probability of default threshold as of January 1, 2011. Since making the determination of the pool of loans to be included in the Legacy Assets & Servicing portfolio, the criteria have not changed for this portfolio; however, the criteria will continue to be evaluated over time.
The Corporation mitigates a portion of its credit risk on the residential mortgage portfolio through the use of synthetic securitization vehicles. These vehicles issue long-term notes to investors, the proceeds of which are held as cash collateral. The Corporation pays a premium to the vehicles to purchase mezzanine loss protection on a portfolio of residential mortgages owned by the Corporation. Cash held in the vehicles is used to reimburse the Corporation in the event that losses on the mortgage portfolio exceed
10
 basis points (bps) of the original pool balance, up to the remaining amount of purchased loss protection of
$783 million
and
$1.1 billion
at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
. The vehicles from which the Corporation purchases credit protection are VIEs. The Corporation does not have a variable interest in these vehicles. Accordingly, these vehicles are not consolidated by the Corporation. Amounts due from the vehicles are recorded in other income (loss) when the Corporation recognizes a reimbursable loss, as described above. Amounts are collected when reimbursable losses are realized through the sale of the underlying collateral. At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Corporation had a receivable of
$359 million
and
$722 million
from these vehicles for reimbursement of losses, and principal of
$23.9 billion
and
 
$53.9 billion
of residential mortgage loans was referenced under these agreements. The Corporation records an allowance for credit losses on these loans without regard to the existence of the purchased loss protection as the protection does not represent a guarantee of individual loans.
In addition, the Corporation has entered into long-term credit protection agreements with FNMA and FHLMC on principal totaling
$23.8 billion
and
$12.9 billion
at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, providing full protection on residential mortgage loans that become severely delinquent. All of these loans are individually insured and therefore the Corporation does not record an allowance for credit losses related to these loans.
Nonperforming Loans and Leases
The Credit Quality table presents the Corporations nonperforming loans and leases including nonperforming TDRs and loans accruing past due 90 days or more at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
. Nonperforming loans and leases exclude performing TDRs and loans accounted for under the fair value option. Nonperforming LHFS are excluded from nonperforming loans and leases as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value.
In addition, PCI loans, consumer credit card loans, business card loans and in general consumer loans not secured by real estate, including renegotiated loans, are not considered nonperforming and are therefore excluded from nonperforming loans and leases in the table below. Real estate-secured past due consumer fully-
 
insured loans are reported as performing since the principal repayment is insured. See
Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Principles
for further information on the criteria for classification as nonperforming.
n/a = not applicable
Included in certain loan categories in nonperforming loans and leases in the table above are TDRs that are classified as nonperforming. At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Corporation had
$4.7 billion
and
$3.0 billion
of residential mortgages,
$539 million
and
$535 million
of home equity,
$97 million
and
$75 million
of discontinued real estate,
$531 million
and
$175 million
of U.S. commercial,
$1.1 billion
and
$770 million
of commercial real estate and
$38 million
and
$7 million
of non-U.S. commercial loans that were TDRs and classified as nonperforming.
Credit Quality Indicators
The Corporation monitors credit quality within its three portfolio segments based on primary credit quality indicators. For more information on the portfolio segments, see
Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Principles
. Within the home loans portfolio segment, the primary credit quality indicators are refreshed LTV and refreshed FICO score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as a percentage of the value of property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans are evaluated using CLTV which measures the carrying value of the combined loans that have liens against the property and the available line
 
of credit as a percentage of the appraised value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. Refreshed FICO score measures the creditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial obligations of the borrower and the borrowers credit history. At a minimum, FICO scores are refreshed quarterly, and in many cases, more frequently. Refreshed FICO score is also a primary credit quality indicator for the credit card and other consumer portfolio segment and the business card portfolio within U.S. small business commercial. The Corporations commercial loans are evaluated using the internal classifications of pass rated or reservable criticized as the primary credit quality indicators. The term reservable criticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or listed by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are asset categories defined by regulatory authorities. These assets have an elevated level of risk and may have a high probability of default or total loss. Pass rated refers to all loans not considered reservable criticized. In addition to these primary credit quality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit quality indicators for certain types of loans.
The following tables present certain credit quality indicators for the Corporations home loans, credit card and other consumer loans, and commercial loan portfolio segments, by class of financing receivables, at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
.
Impaired Loans and Troubled Debt Restructurings
A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information, it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. Impaired loans include nonperforming commercial loans, all TDRs, and the renegotiated credit card and other consumer TDR portfolio (the renegotiated credit card and other consumer TDR portfolio, collectively, the renegotiated TDR portfolio). Impaired loans exclude nonperforming consumer loans and nonperforming commercial leases unless they are classified as TDRs. Loans accounted for under the fair value option are also excluded. PCI loans are excluded and reported separately on page
45
.
Home Loans
Impaired home loans within the home loans portfolio segment consist entirely of TDRs. Excluding PCI loans, substantially all modifications of home loans meet the definition of TDRs. Modifications of home loans are done in accordance with the governments Making Home Affordable Program (modifications under government programs) or the Corporations proprietary programs (modifications under proprietary programs). These modifications are considered to be TDRs if concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Concessions may include reductions in interest rates, capitalization of past due amounts, principal and/or interest forbearance, payment extensions, principal and/or interest forgiveness or combinations thereof.
Prior to permanently modifying a loan, the Corporation may enter into trial modifications with certain borrowers under both government and proprietary programs. Trial modifications generally represent a three- to four-month period during which the borrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated modified payment terms. Upon successful completion of the trial period, the Corporation and the borrower enter into a permanent modification. In accordance with new accounting guidance effective in
2011
, a loan is classified as a TDR when a binding offer is extended to borrowers to enter into a trial modification. At
December 31, 2011
, the Corporation classified as TDRs
$2.6 billion
of home loans that were participating in or had been offered a binding trial modification. These home loans TDRs had an aggregate allowance of
$154 million
at
December 31, 2011
. Approximately
55 percent
of all loans that entered into a trial modification during
2011
became permanent modifications as of
December 31, 2011
.
In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, home loans are not classified as impaired loans unless they have been designated as a TDR. Once such a loan has been designated as a TDR, it is then individually assessed for impairment. Home loan
 
TDRs are measured primarily based on the net present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate. If the carrying value of a TDR exceeds this amount, a specific allowance is recorded as a component of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Alternatively, home loan TDRs that are considered to be dependent solely on the collateral for repayment (e.g., due to the lack of income verification) are measured based on the estimated fair value of the collateral and a charge-off is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the collateral. Home loans that reached 180 days past due prior to modification would have been charged-off to their net realizable value before they were modified as TDRs in accordance with established policy. Therefore, the modification of home loans that are 180 or more days past due as TDRs does not have an impact on the allowance for credit losses nor are additional charge-offs required at the time of modification. Subsequent declines in the fair value of the collateral after a loan has reached 180 days past due are recorded as charge-offs. Fully-insured loans are protected against principal loss, and therefore, the Corporation does not record an allowance for credit losses on the outstanding principal balance, even after they have been modified in a TDR.
The net present value of the estimated cash flows is based on model-driven estimates of projected payments, prepayments, defaults and loss-given-default (LGD). Using statistical modeling methodologies, the Corporation estimates the probability that a loan will default prior to maturity based on the attributes of each loan. The factors that are most relevant to the probability of default are the refreshed LTV or in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed CLTV, borrower credit score, months since origination (i.e., vintage) and geography. Each of these factors is further broken down by present collection status (whether the loan is current, delinquent, in default or in bankruptcy). Severity (or LGD) is estimated based on the refreshed LTV for the first mortgages or CLTV for subordinated liens. The estimates are based on the Corporations historical experience, but are adjusted to reflect an assessment of environmental factors that may not be reflected in the historical data, such as changes in real estate values, local and national economies, underwriting standards and the regulatory environment. The probability of default models also incorporate recent experience with modification programs, a loans default history prior to modification and the change in borrower payments post-modification.
At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, remaining commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a home loan TDR were immaterial. Home loan foreclosed properties totaled
$2.0 billion
and
$1.2 billion
at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
.
The table below presents impaired loans in the Corporations home loans portfolio segment at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
. The impaired home loans table below includes primarily loans managed by Legacy Assets & Servicing. Certain impaired home loans do not have a related allowance as the current valuation of these impaired loans exceeded the carrying value.
n/a = not applicable
The table below presents the
December 31, 2011
unpaid principal balance, carrying value, and average pre- and post-modification interest rates of home loans that were modified in TDRs during
2011
, along with net charge-offs that were recorded during
2011
. The table below consists primarily of TDRs managed by Legacy Assets & Servicing.
The table below presents the
December 31, 2011
carrying value for home loans which were modified in a TDR during
2011
. The table below consists primarily of TDRs managed by Legacy Assets & Servicing.
The table below presents the carrying value of loans that entered into payment default during
2011
and that were modified in a TDR during the 12 months preceding payment default. A payment default for home loan TDRs is recognized when a borrower has missed three monthly payments (not necessarily
 
consecutively) since modification. Payment default on trial modification where the borrower has not yet met the terms of the agreement are included in the table below if the borrower is 90 days or more past due three months after the offer to modify is made.
Credit Card and Other Consumer
The credit card and other consumer portfolio segment includes impaired loans that have been modified as a TDR. The Corporation seeks to assist customers that are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying loans while ensuring compliance with federal laws and guidelines. Substantially all of the Corporations credit card and other consumer loan modifications involve reducing the interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all of which are considered TDRs. In all cases, the customers available line of credit is canceled. The Corporation makes loan modifications directly with borrowers for debt held only by the Corporation (internal programs). Additionally, the Corporation makes loan modifications for borrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies which
 
provide solutions to customers entire unsecured debt structures (external programs).
All credit card and other consumer loans not secured by real estate, including modified loans, remain on accrual status until the loan is either charged-off or paid in full. The allowance for impaired credit card loans is based on the present value of projected cash flows discounted using the portfolios average contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring. Prior to modification, credit card and other consumer loans are included in homogeneous pools which are collectively evaluated for impairment. For these portfolios, loss forecast models are utilized that consider a variety of factors including but not limited to historical loss experience, delinquencies, economic trends and credit scores.
The table below provides information on the Corporations renegotiated TDR portfolio. At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the renegotiated TDR portfolio was considered impaired and had a related allowance as shown in the table below.
The table below provides information on the Corporations primary modification programs for the renegotiated TDR portfolio at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
.
At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Corporation had a renegotiated TDR portfolio of
$7.1 billion
and
$11.4 billion
of which
$5.5 billion
was current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms at
December 31, 2011
. The renegotiated TDR portfolio is excluded from nonperforming loans as the Corporation generally does not classify consumer loans not secured by real estate as nonperforming. Instead, these loans are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes
 
180 days past due.
The table below provides information on the Corporations renegotiated TDR portfolio including the unpaid principal balance and carrying value of loans that were modified in TDRs during
2011
, along with charge-offs that were recorded during
2011
. The table also presents the average pre- and post-modification interest rate.
The table below provides information on the Corporations primary modification programs for the renegotiated TDR portfolio for loans that were modified in TDRs during
2011
.
Credit card and other consumer loans are deemed to be in payment default during the quarter in which a borrower misses the second of two consecutive payments. Payment defaults are one of the factors considered when projecting future cash flows in the calculation of the allowance for loan losses for impaired credit card and other consumer loans. Loans that entered into payment default during
2011
and that had been modified in a TDR during the 12 months preceding payment default were
$863 million
for U.S. credit card,
$409 million
for non-U.S. credit card and
$180 million
for direct/indirect consumer.
Commercial Loans
Impaired commercial loans, which include nonperforming loans and TDRs (both performing and nonperforming) are primarily measured based on the present value of payments expected to be received, discounted at the loans original effective interest rate. Commercial impaired loans may also be measured based on observable market prices or, for loans that are solely dependent on the collateral for repayment, the estimated fair value of collateral less estimated costs to sell. If the carrying value of a loan exceeds this amount, a specific allowance is recorded as a component of the allowance for loan and lease losses.
Modifications of loans to commercial borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty are designed to reduce the Corporations loss exposure while providing the borrower with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties, often to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each modification is unique and reflects
 
the individual circumstances of the borrower. Modifications that result in a TDR may include extensions of maturity at a concessionary (below market) rate of interest, payment forbearances or other actions
designed to benefit the customer while mitigating the Corporations risk exposure. Reductions in interest rates are rare. Instead, the interest rates are typically increased, although the increased rate may not represent a market rate of interest. Infrequently, concessions may also include principal forgiveness in connection with foreclosure, short sale or other settlement agreements leading to termination or sale of the loan.
At the time of restructuring, the loans are remeasured to reflect the impact, if any, on projected cash flows, observable market prices or collateral value resulting from the modified terms. If there was no forgiveness of principal and the interest rate was not decreased, the modification may have little or no impact on the allowance established for the loan. If a portion of the loan is deemed to be uncollectible, a charge-off may be recorded at the time of restructuring. Alternatively, a charge-off may have already been recorded in a previous period such that no charge-off is required at the time of modification.
At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, remaining commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a commercial loan TDR were immaterial. Commercial foreclosed properties totaled
$612 million
and
$725 million
at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
.
The table below presents impaired loans in the Corporations commercial loan portfolio at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
. Certain impaired commercial loans do not have a related allowance as the valuation of these impaired loans exceeded the carrying value, which is net of previously recorded charge-offs.
n/a = not applicable
The Commercial table below presents the
December 31, 2011
unpaid principal balance and carrying value of commercial loans that were modified as TDRs during
2011
, along with charge-offs that were recorded during
2011
. As a result of the retrospective application of new accounting guidance on TDRs, the Corporation classified as TDRs
$1.1 billion
of commercial loan modifications. See
Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Principles
for additional information.
A commercial TDR is generally deemed to be in payment default when the loan is 90 days or more past due, including delinquencies that were not resolved as part of the modification. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are deemed to be in payment default during the quarter in which a borrower misses the second of two consecutive payments. Payment defaults are one of the factors considered when projecting future cash flows, along with observable market prices or fair value of collateral when measuring the allowance for loan losses. TDRs that were in payment default at
December 31, 2011
had a carrying value of
$164 million
for U.S. commercial,
$446 million
for commercial real estate and
$68 million
for U.S. small business commercial.
Purchased Credit-impaired Loans
PCI loans are acquired loans with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination for which it is probable at purchase date that the Corporation will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. PCI loans are pooled based on similar
 
characteristics and evaluated for impairment on a pool basis. The Corporation estimates impairment on its PCI loan portfolio in accordance with applicable accounting guidance on contingencies which involves estimating the expected cash flows of each pool using internal credit risk, interest rate and prepayment risk models. The key assumptions used in the models include the Corporations estimate of default rates, loss severity and prepayment speeds. The carrying value and valuation allowance for Countrywide consumer PCI loans are presented together with the allowance for loan and lease losses. See
Note 7  Allowance for Credit Losses
for additional information.
The table below shows activity for the accretable yield on Countrywide consumer PCI loans. The
$912 million
reclassification from nonaccretable difference during
2011
is primarily due to an increase in the expected life of the PCI loans. The reclassification did not increase the annual yield but, as a result of estimated slower prepayment speeds, added additional interest periods to the expected cash flows.
Loans Held-for-Sale
The Corporation had LHFS of
$13.8 billion
and
$35.1 billion
at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
. Proceeds from sales, securitizations and paydowns of LHFS were
$147.5 billion
,
$281.7 billion
and
$365.1 billion
for
2011
,
2010
and
2009
. Proceeds used for originations and purchases of LHFS were
$118.2 billion
,
$263.0 billion
and
$369.4 billion
for
2011
,
2010
and
2009
.
NOTE 7 
Allowance for Credit Losses
The table below summarizes the changes in the allowance for credit losses for
2011
,
2010
and
2009
.
In
2011
, for the PCI loan portfolio, the Corporation recorded
$2.2 billion
in provision for credit losses with a corresponding increase in the valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. This compared to
$2.2 billion
in
2010
and
$3.5 billion
in
2009
. PCI loans that were acquired as part of the Merrill Lynch acquisition were excluded from current period PCI disclosures as the valuation allowance associated with these loans is no longer significant. The valuation allowance associated with the PCI loan portfolio was
$8.5 billion
,
$6.4 billion
and
$3.9 billion
at
December 31, 2011
,
2010
and
2009
, respectively.
The other amount under allowance for loan and lease losses for
2011
includes a
$449 million
reduction in the allowance for loan and lease losses related to Canadian consumer card loans that were transferred to LHFS. The
2009
other amount includes
 
a
$750 million
reduction in the allowance for loan and lease losses related to
$8.5 billion
of credit card loans that were exchanged for a
$7.8 billion
HTM debt security partially offset by a
$340 million
increase associated with the reclassification to other assets of the amount reimbursable under residential mortgage cash collateralized synthetic securitizations.
The other amount under the reserve for unfunded lending commitments for
2011
and
2010
primarily represents accretion of the Merrill Lynch purchase accounting adjustment and the impact of funding previously unfunded positions. The
2009
amount includes the remaining balance of the acquired Merrill Lynch reserve excluding those commitments accounted for under the fair value option, net of accretion, and the impact of funding previously unfunded positions.

NOTE 8 
Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities
The Corporation utilizes VIEs in the ordinary course of business to support its own and its customers financing and investing needs. The Corporation routinely securitizes loans and debt securities using VIEs as a source of funding for the Corporation and as a means of transferring the economic risk of the loans or debt securities to third parties. The Corporation also administers, structures or invests in other VIEs including CDOs, investment vehicles and other entities.
The following tables present the assets and liabilities of consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, in situations where the Corporation has continuing involvement with transferred assets or if the Corporation otherwise has a variable interest in the VIE. The tables also present the Corporations maximum exposure to loss at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
resulting from its involvement with consolidated VIEs and unconsolidated VIEs in which the Corporation holds a variable interest. The Corporations maximum exposure to loss is based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and incorporates not only potential losses associated with assets recorded on the Corporations Consolidated Balance Sheet but also potential losses associated with off-balance sheet commitments such as unfunded liquidity commitments and other contractual arrangements. The Corporations maximum exposure to loss does not include losses previously recognized through write-downs of assets.
The Corporation invests in ABS issued by third-party VIEs with which it has no other form of involvement. These securities are included in
Note 3  Trading Account Assets and Liabilities
and
Note 5  Securities
.
In addition, the Corporation uses VIEs such as trust preferred securities trusts in connection with its funding activities as described in
Note 13  Long-term Debt
. The Corporation also uses VIEs in the form of synthetic securitization vehicles to mitigate
 
a portion of the credit risk on its residential mortgage loan portfolio as described in
Note 6  Outstanding Loans and Leases
. The Corporation uses VIEs, such as cash funds managed within
Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM)
, to provide investment opportunities for clients. These VIEs, which are not consolidated by the Corporation, are not included in the tables within this Note.
Except as described below, the Corporation did not provide financial support to consolidated or unconsolidated VIEs during
2011
or
2010
that it was not previously contractually required to provide, nor does it intend to do so.
Mortgage-related Securitizations
First-lien Mortgages
As part of its mortgage banking activities, the Corporation securitizes a portion of the first-lien residential mortgage loans it originates or purchases from third parties, generally in the form of MBS guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, FNMA and FHLMC (collectively the GSEs), or GNMA in the case of FHA-insured and U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA)-guaranteed mortgage loans. Securitization usually occurs in conjunction with or shortly after loan closing or purchase. In addition, the Corporation may, from time to time, securitize commercial mortgages it originates or purchases from other entities. The Corporation typically services the loans it securitizes. Further, the Corporation may retain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts including senior and subordinate securities and equity tranches issued by the trusts. Except as described below and in
Note 9  Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees
, the Corporation does not provide guarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard representations and warranties.
The table below summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage securitizations for
2011
and
2010
.
In addition to cash proceeds as reported in the table above, the Corporation received securities with an initial fair value of
$545 million
and
$23.7 billion
in connection with first-lien mortgage securitizations, principally residential agency securitizations, in
2011
and
2010
. All of these securities were initially classified as Level 2 assets within the fair value hierarchy. During
2011
and
2010
, there were no changes to the initial classification.
The Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of first-lien mortgage loans. Servicing fee and ancillary fee income on consumer mortgage loans serviced, including securitizations where the Corporation has continuing involvement, were
$5.8 billion
and
$6.4 billion
in
2011
and
2010
. Servicing advances on consumer mortgage loans, including
 
securitizations where the Corporation has continuing involvement, were
$26.0 billion
and
$24.3 billion
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of securitization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is required to make. During
2011
and
2010
,
$9.0 billion
and
$14.5 billion
of loans were repurchased from first-lien securitization trusts as a result of loan delinquencies or in order to perform modifications. The majority of these loans repurchased were FHA-insured mortgages collateralizing GNMA securities. In addition, the Corporation has retained commercial MSRs from the sale or securitization of commercial mortgage loans. Servicing fee and ancillary fee income on commercial mortgage loans serviced, including securitizations where the
Corporation has continuing involvement, were a loss of
$12 million
and a gain of
$21 million
in
2011
and
2010
. Servicing advances on commercial mortgage loans, including securitizations where the Corporation has continuing involvement, were
$152 million
and
$156 million
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. For additional
 
information on MSRs, see
Note 25  Mortgage Servicing Rights
.
The table below summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage securitization trusts in which the Corporation held a variable interest at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
.
As a result of a settlement agreement with Assured Guaranty Ltd. and its subsidiaries (Assured Guaranty) in 2011, the Corporation entered into a loss-sharing reinsurance arrangement involving
21
first-lien RMBS trusts. This obligation is a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the trusts. To the extent that the Corporation services all or a majority of the loans in any of the
21
trusts, the Corporation is the primary beneficiary. At
December 31, 2011
,
12
of these trusts were consolidated. Assets and liabilities of the consolidated trusts and the Corporations maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated trusts are included in the table above as non-agency prime and subprime trusts. For additional information, see
Note 9  Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees
.
 
Home Equity Loans
The Corporation retains interests in home equity securitization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. These retained interests include senior and subordinate securities and residual interests. In addition, the Corporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the trusts during a rapid amortization event. The Corporation also services the loans in the trusts. Except as described below and in
Note 9  Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees
, the Corporation does not provide guarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard representations and warranties. There were no securitizations of home equity loans during
2011
and
2010
. All of the home equity trusts have entered the amortization phase and, accordingly, there were
no
collections reinvested in revolving period securitizations in
2011
. Collections reinvested in revolving period securitizations were
$21 million
in
2010
.
The table below summarizes select information related to home equity loan securitization trusts in which the Corporation held a variable interest at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
.
Included in the table above are consolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan securitizations that have entered a rapid amortization period and for which the Corporation is obligated to provide subordinated funding. During this period, cash payments from borrowers are accumulated to repay outstanding debt securities and the Corporation continues to make advances to borrowers when they draw on their lines of credit. The Corporation then transfers the newly generated receivables into the securitization vehicles and is reimbursed only after other parties in the securitization have received all of the cash flows to which they are entitled. If loan losses requiring draws on monoline insurers policies, which protect the bondholders in the securitization, exceed a certain level, the Corporation may not receive reimbursement for all of the funds advanced to borrowers, as the senior bondholders and the monoline insurers have priority for repayment. The Corporation evaluates each of these securitizations for potential losses due to non-recoverable advances by estimating the amount and timing of future losses on the underlying loans, the excess spread available to cover such losses and potential cash flow shortfalls during rapid amortization. This evaluation, which includes the number of loans still in revolving status, the amount of available credit and when those loans will lose revolving status, is also used to determine whether the
 
Corporation has a variable interest that is more than insignificant and must consolidate the trust. A maximum funding obligation attributable to rapid amortization cannot be calculated as a home equity borrower has the ability to pay down and re-draw balances. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, home equity loan securitization transactions in rapid amortization for which the Corporation has a subordinate funding obligation, including both consolidated and unconsolidated trusts, had
$10.7 billion
and
$12.5 billion
of trust certificates outstanding. This amount is significantly greater than the amount the Corporation expects to fund. The charges that will ultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn available credit on the home equity lines, which totaled
$460 million
and
$639 million
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, as well as performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, the reserve for losses on expected future draw obligations on the home equity loan securitizations in rapid amortization for which the Corporation has a subordinated funding obligation was
$69 million
and
$131 million
.
The Corporation has consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of home equity loans. The Corporation recorded
$62 million
and
$79 million
of servicing fee income related to home equity securitizations during
2011
and
2010
.
Credit Card Securitizations
The Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card loans. The Corporations continuing involvement with the securitization trusts includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided interest (sellers interest) in the receivables, and holding certain retained interests including senior and subordinate securities, discount receivables, subordinate interests in accrued
 
interest and fees on the securitized receivables, and cash reserve accounts. The sellers interest in the trusts, which is pari passu to the investors interest, and the discount receivables are classified in loans and leases.
The table below summarizes select information related to credit card securitization trusts in which the Corporation held a variable interest at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
.
During
2010
,
$2.9 billion
of new senior debt securities were issued to third-party investors from the credit card securitization trusts and
none
were issued in
2011
.
During
2010
, subordinate securities with a notional principal amount of
$11.5 billion
and a stated interest rate of
zero percent
were issued by certain credit card securitization trusts to the Corporation. In addition, the Corporation elected to designate a specified percentage of new receivables transferred to the trusts as discount receivables such that principal collections thereon are added to finance charges which increases the yield in the trust.
 
Through the designation of newly transferred receivables as discount receivables, the Corporation has subordinated a portion of its sellers interest to the investors interest. These actions, which were specifically permitted by the terms of the trust documents, were taken in an effort to address the decline in the excess spread of the U.S. and U.K. credit card securitization trusts. The U.S. election expired June 30, 2011. The issuance of subordinate securities and the discount receivables election had no impact on the Corporations results of operations in
2011
and
2010
.
Other Asset-backed Securitizations
Other asset-backed securitizations include resecuritization trusts, municipal bond trusts, and automobile and other securitization trusts. The table below summarizes select information related to other asset-backed securitizations in which the Corporation held a variable interest at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
.
Resecuritization Trusts
The Corporation transfers existing securities, typically MBS, into resecuritization vehicles at the request of customers seeking securities with specific characteristics. The Corporation may also enter into resecuritizations of securities within its investment portfolio for purposes of improving liquidity and capital, and managing credit or interest rate risk. Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust and no single investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust.
The Corporation resecuritized
$33.6 billion
of securities in
2011
compared to
$97.7 billion
in
2010
. Net gains on sales totaled
$909 million
in
2011
compared to net losses of
$144 million
in
2010
. The Corporation consolidates a resecuritization trust if it has sole discretion over the design of the trust, including the identification of securities to be transferred in and the structure of securities to be issued, and also retains a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the trust. If one or a limited number of third-party investors share responsibility for the design of the trust and purchase a significant portion of securities, including subordinate securities issued by non-agency trusts, the Corporation does not consolidate the trust.
 
Municipal Bond Trusts
The Corporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. A majority of the bonds are rated AAA or AA and some benefit from insurance provided by third parties. The trusts obtain financing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates that reprice on a weekly or other basis to third-party investors. The Corporation may serve as remarketing agent and/or liquidity provider for the trusts. The floating-rate investors have the right to tender the certificates at specified dates, often with as little as seven days notice. Should the Corporation be unable to remarket the tendered certificates, it is generally obligated to purchase them at par under standby liquidity facilities unless the bonds credit rating has declined below investment grade or there has been an event of default or bankruptcy of the issuer and insurer.
The Corporation also provides credit enhancement to investors in certain municipal bond trusts whereby the Corporation guarantees the payment of interest and principal on floating-rate certificates issued by these trusts in the event of default by the issuer of the underlying municipal bond. If a customer holds the residual interest in a trust, that customer typically has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust at any time, while the
Corporation typically has the ability to trigger the liquidation of that trust if the market value of the bonds held in the trust declines below a specified threshold. This arrangement is designed to limit market losses to an amount that is less than the customers residual interest, effectively preventing the Corporation from absorbing losses incurred on assets held within that trust.
During
2011
and
2010
, the Corporation was the transferor of assets into unconsolidated municipal bond trusts and received cash proceeds from new securitizations of
$733 million
and
$1.2 billion
. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, the principal balance outstanding for unconsolidated municipal bond securitization trusts for which the Corporation was transferor was
$2.5 billion
and
$2.2 billion
.
The Corporations liquidity commitments to unconsolidated municipal bond trusts, including those for which the Corporation was transferor, totaled
$3.5 billion
and
$4.0 billion
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. The weighted-average remaining life of bonds held in the trusts at
December 31, 2011
was
10.0
years. There were no material write-downs or downgrades of assets or issuers during
2011
.
Automobile and Other Securitization Trusts
The Corporation transfers automobile and other loans into securitization trusts, typically to improve liquidity or manage credit risk. At
December 31, 2011
, the Corporation serviced assets or otherwise had continuing involvement with automobile and other securitization trusts with outstanding balances of
$5.8 billion
, including trusts collateralized by automobile loans of
$3.9 billion
, student loans of
$1.2 billion
, and other loans and receivables of
 
$668 million
. At
December 31, 2010
, the Corporation serviced assets or otherwise had continuing involvement with automobile and other securitization trusts with outstanding balances of
$10.5 billion
, including trusts collateralized by automobile loans of
$8.4 billion
, student loans of
$1.3 billion
, and other loans and receivables of
$774 million
.
Collateralized Debt Obligation Vehicles
CDO vehicles hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities, typically corporate debt or ABS, which they fund by issuing multiple tranches of debt and equity securities. Synthetic CDOs enter into a portfolio of CDS to synthetically create exposure to fixed-income securities. CLOs are a subset of CDOs which hold pools of loans, typically corporate loans or commercial mortgages. CDOs are typically managed by third-party portfolio managers. The Corporation transfers assets to these CDOs, holds securities issued by the CDOs and may be a derivative counterparty to the CDOs, including a CDS counterparty for synthetic CDOs. The Corporation has also entered into total return swaps with certain CDOs whereby the Corporation absorbs the economic returns generated by specified assets held by the CDO. The Corporation receives fees for structuring CDOs and providing liquidity support for super senior tranches of securities issued by certain CDOs. No third parties provide a significant amount of similar commitments to these CDOs.
The table below summarizes select information related to CDO vehicles in which the Corporation held a variable interest at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
.
The Corporations maximum loss exposure of
$4.0 billion
at
December 31, 2011
included
$336 million
of super senior CDO exposure,
$1.7 billion
of exposure to CDO financing facilities and
$2.0 billion
of other non-super senior exposure. This exposure is calculated on a gross basis and does not reflect any benefit from insurance purchased from third parties. Net of this insurance but including securities retained from liquidations of CDOs, the Corporations net exposure to super senior CDO-related positions was
$152 million
at
December 31, 2011
. The CDO financing facilities, which are consolidated, obtain funding from third parties for CDO positions which are principally classified in trading account assets on the Corporations Consolidated Balance Sheet. The CDO financing facilities long-term debt at
December 31, 2011
totaled
$2.6 billion
, all of which has recourse to the general credit of the
 
Corporation. The Corporations maximum exposure to loss is significantly less than the total assets of the CDO vehicles in the table above because the Corporation typically has exposure to only a portion of the total assets.
At
December 31, 2011
, the Corporation had
$2.4 billion
of aggregate liquidity exposure to CDOs. This amount included
$588 million
of commitments to CDOs to provide funding for super senior exposures and
$1.8 billion
notional amount of derivative contracts with unconsolidated VIEs, principally CDO vehicles, which hold non-super senior CDO debt securities or other debt securities on the Corporations behalf. See
Note 14  Commitments and Contingencies
for additional information. The Corporations liquidity exposure to CDOs at
December 31, 2011
is included in the table above to the extent that the Corporation sponsored the
CDO vehicle or the liquidity exposure is more than insignificant compared to total assets of the CDO vehicle. Liquidity exposure included in the table is reported net of previously recorded losses.
Customer Vehicles
Customer vehicles include credit-linked and equity-linked note vehicles, repackaging vehicles and asset acquisition vehicles,
 
which are typically created on behalf of customers who wish to obtain market or credit exposure to a specific company or financial instrument.
The table below summarizes select information related to customer vehicles in which the Corporation held a variable interest at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
.
Credit-linked and equity-linked note vehicles issue notes which pay a return that is linked to the credit or equity risk of a specified company or debt instrument. The vehicles purchase high-grade assets as collateral and enter into CDSs or equity derivatives to synthetically create the credit or equity risk to pay the specified return on the notes. The Corporation is typically the counterparty for some or all of the credit and equity derivatives and, to a lesser extent, it may invest in securities issued by the vehicles. The Corporation may also enter into interest rate or foreign currency derivatives with the vehicles. The Corporation also had approximately
$824 million
of other liquidity commitments, including written put options and collateral value guarantees, with unconsolidated credit-linked and equity-linked note vehicles at
December 31, 2011
.
Repackaging vehicles issue notes that are designed to incorporate risk characteristics desired by customers. The vehicles hold debt instruments such as corporate bonds, convertible bonds or ABS with the desired credit risk profile. The Corporation enters into derivatives with the vehicles to change the interest rate or foreign currency profile of the debt instruments. If a vehicle holds convertible bonds and the Corporation retains the conversion option, the Corporation is deemed to have a controlling financial interest and consolidates the vehicle.
Asset acquisition vehicles acquire financial instruments, typically loans, at the direction of a single customer and obtain funding through the issuance of structured liabilities to the
 
Corporation. At the time the vehicle acquires an asset, the Corporation enters into total return swaps with the customer such that the economic returns of the asset are passed through to the customer. The Corporation is exposed to counterparty credit risk if the asset declines in value and the customer defaults on its obligation to the Corporation under the total return swaps. The Corporations risk may be mitigated by collateral or other arrangements. The Corporation consolidates these vehicles because it has the power to manage the assets in the vehicles and owns all of the structured liabilities issued by the vehicles.
The Corporations maximum exposure to loss from customer vehicles includes the notional amount of the credit or equity derivatives to which the Corporation is a counterparty, net of losses previously recorded, and the Corporations investment, if any, in securities issued by the vehicles. It has not been reduced to reflect the benefit of offsetting swaps with the customers or collateral arrangements.
Other Variable Interest Entities
Other consolidated VIEs primarily include investment vehicles, leveraged lease trusts and, at
December 31, 2010
, a collective investment fund and asset acquisition conduits. Other unconsolidated VIEs primarily include investment vehicles and real estate vehicles.
The table below summarizes select information related to other VIEs in which the Corporation held a variable interest at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
.
Investment Vehicles
The Corporation sponsors, invests in or provides financing to a variety of investment vehicles that hold loans, real estate, debt securities or other financial instruments and are designed to provide the desired investment profile to investors. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, the Corporations consolidated investment vehicles had total assets of
$2.6 billion
and
$5.6 billion
. The Corporation also held investments in unconsolidated vehicles with total assets of
$5.5 billion
and
$7.9 billion
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. The Corporations maximum exposure to loss associated with both consolidated and unconsolidated investment vehicles totaled
$4.4 billion
and
$8.7 billion
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
comprised primarily of on-balance sheet assets less non-recourse liabilities.
Collective Investment Funds
The Corporation is trustee for certain common and collective investment funds that provide investment opportunities for eligible clients of
GWIM
. These funds, which had total assets of
$11.1 billion
and
$21.2 billion
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, hold a variety of cash, debt and equity investments. At
December 31, 2011
, the Corporation did not have a variable interest in these funds. The Corporation consolidated a stable value collective investment fund with total assets of
$8.1 billion
at
December 31, 2010
, for which the Corporation had the unilateral ability to replace the funds asset manager. The fund was liquidated during 2011.
Leveraged Lease Trusts
The Corporations net investment in consolidated leveraged lease trusts totaled
$4.8 billion
and
$5.2 billion
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. The trusts hold long-lived equipment such as rail cars, power generation and distribution equipment, and commercial
 
aircraft. The Corporation structures the trusts and holds a significant residual interest. The net investment represents the Corporations maximum loss exposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that the leveraged lease investments become worthless. Debt issued by the leveraged lease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation. The Corporation has no liquidity exposure to these leveraged lease trusts.
Asset Acquisition Conduits
The Corporation administered two asset acquisition conduits which acquired assets on behalf of the Corporation or its customers. These conduits had total assets of
$640 million
at
December 31, 2010
. The conduits were liquidated during 2011. Liquidation of the conduits did not impact the Corporations results of operations.
Real Estate Vehicles
The Corporation held investments in unconsolidated real estate vehicles of
$5.4 billion
at both
December 31, 2011
and
2010
which consisted of investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships that finance the construction and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing. An unrelated third party is typically the general partner and has control over the significant activities of the partnership. The Corporation earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the affordable housing projects. The Corporations risk of loss is mitigated by policies requiring that the project qualify for the expected tax credits prior to making its investment. The Corporation may from time to time be asked to invest additional amounts to support a troubled project. Such additional investments have not been and are not expected to be significant.
Other Asset-backed Financing Arrangements
The Corporation transferred pools of securities to certain independent third parties and provided financing for approximately
75 percent
of the purchase price under asset-backed financing arrangements. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, the Corporations maximum loss exposure under these financing arrangements was
$4.7 billion
and
$6.5 billion
, substantially all of which was classified as loans on the Corporations Consolidated Balance Sheet. All principal and interest payments have been received when due in accordance with the contractual terms. These arrangements are not included in the Other VIEs table because the purchasers are not VIEs.
NOTE 9
 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees
Background
The Corporation securitizes first-lien residential mortgage loans, generally in the form of MBS guaranteed by the GSEs or by GNMA in the case of FHA-insured, VA-guaranteed and Rural Housing Service-guaranteed mortgage loans. In addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations (in certain of these securitizations, monolines or financial guarantee providers insured all or some of the securities), or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, the Corporation or certain subsidiaries or legacy companies make or have made various representations and warranties. These representations and warranties, as set forth in the agreements, related to, among other things, the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing the loan, the process used to select the loan for inclusion in a transaction, the loans compliance with any applicable loan criteria, including underwriting standards, and the loans compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws. Breaches of these representations and warranties may result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or provide other remedies to the GSEs, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) with respect to FHA-insured loans, VA, whole-loan buyers, securitization trusts, monoline insurers or other financial guarantors (collectively, repurchases). In such cases, the Corporation would be exposed to any credit loss on the repurchased mortgage loans after accounting for any mortgage insurance (MI) or mortgage guaranty payments that it may receive.
Subject to the requirements and limitations of the applicable sales and securitization agreements, these representations and warranties can be enforced by the GSEs, HUD, VA, the whole-loan buyer, the securitization trustee or others as governed by the applicable agreement or, in certain first-lien and home equity securitizations where monoline insurers or other financial guarantee providers have insured all or some of the securities issued, by the monoline insurer or other financial guarantor. In the case of loans sold to parties other than the GSEs or GNMA, the contractual liability to repurchase typically arises only if there is a breach of the representations and warranties that materially and adversely affects the interest of the investor, or investors, in the loan, or of the monoline insurer or other financial guarantor (as applicable). Contracts with the GSEs do not contain equivalent language, while GNMA generally limits repurchases to loans that are not insured or guaranteed as required. The Corporation
 
believes that the longer a loan performs prior to default, the less likely it is that an alleged underwriting breach of representations and warranties had a material impact on the loans performance. Historically, most demands for repurchase have occurred within the first several years after origination, generally after a loan has defaulted. However, the time horizon in which repurchase claims are typically brought has lengthened primarily due to a significant increase in GSE claims related to loans that had defaulted more than
18
months prior to the claim and to loans where the borrower made at least
25
payments.
The Corporations credit loss would be reduced by any recourse it may have to organizations (e.g., correspondents) that, in turn, had sold such loans to the Corporation based upon its agreements with these organizations. When a loan is originated by a correspondent or other third party, the Corporation typically has the right to seek a recovery of related repurchase losses from that originator. Many of the correspondent originators of loans in
2004
through
2008
are no longer in business, or are in a weakened condition, and the Corporations ability to recover on valid claims is therefore impacted, or eliminated accordingly. In the event a loan is originated and underwritten by a correspondent who obtains FHA insurance, even if they are no longer in business, any breach of FHA guidelines is the direct obligation of the correspondent, not the Corporation. At
December 31, 2011
, approximately
28 percent
of the outstanding repurchase claims relate to loans purchased from correspondents or other parties compared to approximately
25 percent
at
December 31, 2010
. During
2011
, the Corporation experienced a decline in recoveries from correspondents and other parties; however, the actual recovery rate may vary from period to period based upon the underlying mix of correspondents and other parties.
The Corporation currently structures its operations to limit the risk of repurchase and accompanying credit exposure by seeking to ensure consistent production of mortgages in accordance with its underwriting procedures and by servicing those mortgages consistent with its contractual obligations. In addition, certain securitizations include guarantees written to protect certain purchasers of the loans from credit losses up to a specified amount. The fair value of the obligations to be absorbed under the representations and warranties and guarantees provided is recorded as an accrued liability when the loans are sold. This liability for probable losses is updated by accruing a representations and warranties provision in mortgage banking income. This is done throughout the life of the loan, as necessary when additional relevant information becomes available.
The methodology used to estimate the liability for representations and warranties is a function of the representations and warranties given and considers a variety of factors, which include, depending on the counterparty, actual defaults, estimated future defaults, historical loss experience, estimated home prices, other economic conditions, estimated probability that a repurchase claim will be received, including consideration of whether presentation thresholds will be met, number of payments made by the borrower prior to default and estimated probability that a loan will be required to be repurchased. The Corporation also considers bulk settlements when determining its estimated liability for representations and warranties. The estimate of the liability for representations and warranties is based upon currently available information, significant judgment, and a number of factors, including those set forth above, that are subject to change. Changes to any one of these factors could significantly impact the estimate of the liability and could have a material adverse impact
on the Corporations results of operations for any particular period. Given that these factors vary by counterparty, the Corporation analyzes representations and warranties obligations based on the specific counterparty, or type of counterparty, with whom the sale was made. Generally the volume of unresolved repurchase claims from the FHA and VA for loans in GNMA-guaranteed securities is not significant because the requests are limited in number and are typically resolved quickly.
Settlement Actions
The Corporation has vigorously contested any request for repurchase when it has concluded that a valid basis for repurchase does not exist and will continue to do so in the future. However, in an effort to resolve these legacy mortgage-related issues, the Corporation has reached bulk settlements, or agreements for bulk settlements, including settlement amounts which have been material, with counterparties in lieu of a loan-by-loan review process. The Corporation may reach other settlements in the future if opportunities arise on terms it believes to be advantageous to the Corporation. The following provides a summary of the larger bulk settlement actions beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010 followed by details of the Corporations representations and warranties liability, including claims status.
Settlement with the Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee
On
June 28, 2011
, the Corporation, BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP (BAC HLS, which was subsequently merged with and into BANA in July 2011), and its legacy Countrywide affiliates entered into a settlement agreement with the Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon), as trustee (the Trustee), to resolve all outstanding and potential claims related to alleged representations and warranties breaches (including repurchase claims), substantially all historical loan servicing claims and certain other historical claims with respect to
525
legacy Countrywide first-lien and
five
second-lien non-GSE residential mortgage-backed securitization trusts (the Covered Trusts) containing loans principally originated between
2004
and
2008
for which BNY Mellon acts as trustee or indenture trustee (the BNY Mellon Settlement). The Covered Trusts had an original principal balance of approximately
$424 billion
, of which
$409 billion
was originated between
2004
and
2008
, and total outstanding principal and unpaid principal balance of loans that had defaulted (collectively unpaid principal balance) of approximately
$220 billion
at
June 28, 2011
, of which
$217 billion
was originated between
2004
and
2008
. The BNY Mellon Settlement is supported by a group of
22
institutional investors (the Investor Group) and is subject to final court approval and certain other conditions.
The BNY Mellon Settlement provides for a cash payment of
$8.5 billion
(the Settlement Payment) to the Trustee for distribution to the Covered Trusts after final court approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement. In addition to the Settlement Payment, the Corporation is obligated to pay attorneys fees and costs to the Investor Groups counsel as well as all fees and expenses incurred by the Trustee related to obtaining final court approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement and certain tax rulings, which are currently estimated at
$100 million
.
The BNY Mellon Settlement does not cover a small number of legacy Countrywide-issued first-lien non-GSE RMBS transactions with loans originated principally between
2004
and
2008
for various reasons, including for example,
six
legacy Countrywide-
 
issued first-lien non-GSE RMBS transactions in which BNY Mellon is not the trustee. The BNY Mellon Settlement also does not cover legacy Countrywide-issued second-lien securitization transactions in which a monoline insurer or other financial guarantor provides financial guaranty insurance. In addition, because the settlement is with the Trustee on behalf of the Covered Trusts and releases rights under the governing agreements for the Covered Trusts, the settlement does not release investors securities law or fraud claims based upon disclosures made in connection with their decision to purchase, sell or hold securities issued by the Covered Trusts. To date, various investors, including certain members of the Investor Group, are pursuing securities law or fraud claims related to one or more of the Covered Trusts. The Corporation is not able to determine whether any additional securities law or fraud claims will be made by investors in the Covered Trusts. For information about mortgage-related securities law or fraud claims, see Litigation and Regulatory Matters in
Note 14  Commitments and Contingencies
. For those Covered Trusts where a monoline insurer or other financial guarantor has an independent right to assert repurchase claims directly, the BNY Mellon Settlement does not release such insurers or guarantors repurchase claims.
Under an order entered by the court in connection with the BNY Mellon Settlement, potentially interested persons had the opportunity to give notice of intent to object to the settlement (including on the basis that more information was needed) until August 30, 2011. Approximately
44
groups or entities appeared prior to the deadline;
two
of those groups or entities have subsequently withdrawn from the proceeding and one motion to intervene was denied. Certain of these groups or entities filed notices of intent to object, made motions to intervene, or both filed notices of intent to object and made motions to intervene. The parties filing motions to intervene include the Attorneys General of the states of New York and Delaware, whose motions to intervene were granted. Parties who filed notices stating that they wished to obtain more information about the settlement include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Bank of America is not a party to the proceeding.
Certain of the motions to intervene and/or notices of intent to object allege various purported bases for opposition to the settlement, including challenges to the nature of the court proceeding and the lack of an opt-out mechanism, alleged conflicts of interest on the part of the Investor Group and/or the Trustee, the inadequacy of the settlement amount and the method of allocating the settlement amount among the Covered Trusts, while other motions do not make substantive objections but state that they need more information about the settlement. An investor opposed to the settlement removed the proceeding to federal court. On
October 19, 2011
, the federal court denied BNY Mellons motion to remand the proceeding to state court. BNY Mellon, as well as the investors that have intervened in support of the BNY Mellon Settlement, petitioned to appeal the denial of this motion. On November 4, 2011, the district court entered a written order setting a discovery schedule, and discovery is ongoing. On
December 27, 2011
, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit accepted the appeal and stated in an amended scheduling order that, pursuant to statute, it would rule on the appeal by
February 27, 2012
.
It is not currently possible to predict how many of the parties who have appeared in the court proceeding will ultimately object to the BNY Mellon Settlement, whether the objections will prevent receipt of final court approval or the ultimate outcome of the court
approval process, which can include appeals and could take a substantial period of time. In particular, conduct of discovery and the resolution of the objections to the settlement and any appeals could take a substantial period of time and these factors could materially delay the timing of final court approval. Accordingly, it is not possible to predict when the court approval process will be completed.
If final court approval is not obtained by
December 31, 2015
, the Corporation and legacy Countrywide may withdraw from the BNY Mellon Settlement, if the Trustee consents. The BNY Mellon Settlement also provides that if Covered Trusts representing unpaid principal balance exceeding a specified amount are excluded from the final BNY Mellon Settlement, based on investor objections or otherwise, the Corporation and legacy Countrywide have the option to withdraw from the BNY Mellon Settlement pursuant to the terms of the BNY Mellon Settlement agreement.
There can be no assurance that final court approval of the settlement will be obtained, that all conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement will be satisfied or, if certain conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement permitting withdrawal are met, that the Corporation and legacy Countrywide will not determine to withdraw from the settlement. If final court approval is not obtained or if the Corporation and legacy Countrywide determine to withdraw from the BNY Mellon Settlement in accordance with its terms, the Corporations future representations and warranties losses could be substantially different than existing accruals and the estimated range of possible loss over existing accruals described under
Whole Loan Sales and Private-label Securitizations Experience

.
Settlement with Assured Guaranty
On
April 14, 2011
, the Corporation, including its legacy Countrywide affiliates, entered into an agreement with Assured Guaranty, to resolve all of the monoline insurers outstanding and potential repurchase claims related to alleged representations and warranties breaches involving
29
first- and second-lien RMBS trusts where Assured Guaranty provided financial guarantee insurance (the Assured Guaranty Settlement). The agreement also resolves historical loan servicing issues and other potential liabilities with respect to these trusts. The agreement covers
21
first-lien RMBS trusts and
eight
second-lien RMBS trusts, which had an original principal balance of approximately
$35.8 billion
and total unpaid principal balance of approximately
$20.2 billion
as of
April 14, 2011
. The agreement included cash payments totaling approximately
$1.1 billion
to Assured Guaranty, as well as a loss-sharing reinsurance arrangement that had an expected value of approximately
$470 million
at the time of the settlement, and other terms, including termination of certain derivative contracts. During 2011, the Corporation made cash payments of
$1.0 billion
with the remaining
$57 million
payable on March 31, 2012. The total cost recognized for the Assured Guaranty Settlement as of
December 31, 2011
was approximately
$1.6 billion
. As a result of this agreement, the Corporation recorded
$2.2 billion
in consumer loans and the related trust debt on its Consolidated Balance Sheet at
December 31, 2011
, due to the
 
establishment of reinsurance contracts at the time of the Assured Guaranty Settlement.
Government-sponsored Enterprise Agreements
On
December 31, 2010
, the Corporation reached agreements with the GSEs, under which the Corporation paid
$2.8 billion
to resolve repurchase claims involving first-lien residential mortgage loans sold directly to the GSEs by entities related to legacy Countrywide (the GSE Agreements). The agreement with FHLMC extinguished all outstanding and potential mortgage repurchase and make-whole claims arising out of any alleged breaches of selling representations and warranties related to loans sold directly by legacy Countrywide to FHLMC through
2008
, subject to certain exceptions. The agreement with FNMA substantially resolved the existing pipeline of repurchase claims outstanding as of September 20, 2010 arising out of alleged breaches of selling representations and warranties related to loans sold directly by legacy Countrywide to FNMA. The GSE Agreements did not cover outstanding and potential mortgage repurchase claims arising out of any alleged breaches of selling representations and warranties related to legacy Bank of America first-lien residential mortgage loans sold directly to the GSEs or other loans sold directly to the GSEs other than described above, loan servicing obligations, other contractual obligations or loans contained in private-label securitizations.
Outstanding Claims
The Outstanding Claims by Counterparty and Product table presents outstanding representations and warranties claims by counterparty and product type at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. For additional information, see
Whole Loan Sales and Private-label Securitizations Experience
on page
63
of this Note and
Note 14  Commitments and Contingencies
. These repurchase claims include
$1.7 billion
in demands from investors in the Covered Trusts received in
2010
, but otherwise do not include any repurchase claims related to the Covered Trusts. During
2011
, the Corporation received
$17.5 billion
in new repurchase claims, including
$14.3 billion
in new repurchase claims submitted by the GSEs for both legacy Countrywide originations not covered by the GSE Agreements and legacy Bank of America originations, and
$3.2 billion
in repurchase claims related to non-GSE transactions. During
2011
,
$14.1 billion
in claims were resolved primarily with the GSEs and through the Assured Guaranty Settlement. Of the claims resolved,
$7.5 billion
were resolved through rescissions and
$6.6 billion
were resolved through mortgage repurchase and make-whole payments. Claims outstanding from the monolines declined as a result of the Assured Guaranty Settlement, and new claims from other monolines declined significantly during 2011, which the Corporation believes was due in part to the monolines focusing recent efforts towards litigation. Outstanding claims from whole loan, private-label securitization and other investors increased during 2011 primarily as a result of the increase in repurchase claims received from trustees in non-GSE transactions.
The number of repurchase claims as a percentage of the number of loans purchased arising from loans sourced from brokers or purchased from third-party sellers is relatively consistent with the number of repurchase claims as a percentage of the number of loans originated by the Corporation or its subsidiaries or legacy companies.
Mortgage Insurance Rescission Notices
In addition to repurchase claims, the Corporation receives notices from mortgage insurance companies of claim denials, cancellations, or coverage rescission (collectively, MI rescission notices) and the amount of such notices have remained elevated. When there is disagreement with the mortgage insurer as to the resolution of a MI rescission notice, meaningful dialogue and negotiation are generally necessary between the parties to reach a conclusion on an individual notice. The level of engagement of the mortgage insurance companies varies and on-going litigation involving some of the mortgage insurance companies over individual and bulk rescissions or claims for rescission limits the ability of the Corporation to engage in constructive dialogue leading to resolution. For loans sold to GSEs or private-label securitization trusts (including those wrapped by the monoline bond insurers), a MI rescission may give rise to a claim for breach of the applicable representations and warranties, depending on the governing sales contracts. In those cases where the governing contract contains a MI-related representation and warranty which upon rescission requires the Corporation to repurchase the affected loan or indemnify the investor for the related loss, the Corporation realizes the loss without the benefit of MI. If the Corporation is required to repurchase a loan or indemnify the investor as a result of a different breach of representations and warranties and there has been a MI rescission, or if the Corporation holds the loan for investment, it realizes the loss without the benefit of MI. In addition, mortgage insurance companies have in some cases asserted the ability to curtail MI payments, which in these cases would reduce the MI proceeds available to reduce the loss on the loan. While a legitimate MI rescission may constitute a valid basis for repurchase or other remedies under the GSE agreements and a
 
small number of private-label MBS securitizations, and a MI rescission notice may result in a repurchase request, the Corporation believes MI rescission notices in and of themselves are not valid repurchase requests.
On June 30, 2011, FNMA issued an announcement requiring servicers to report, effective
October 1, 2011
, all MI rescissions, cancellations and claim denials (together, rescissions) with respect to loans sold to FNMA. The announcement also confirmed FNMAs view of its position that a mortgage insurance companys issuance of a MI rescission notice constitutes a breach of the lenders representations and warranties and permits FNMA to require the lender to repurchase the mortgage loan or promptly remit a make-whole payment covering FNMAs loss even if the lender is contesting the MI rescission notice. A related announcement included a ban on bulk settlements with mortgage insurers that provide for loss sharing in lieu of rescission. According to FNMAs announcement, through
June 30, 2012
, lenders have 90 days to appeal FNMAs repurchase request and 30 days (or such other time frame specified by FNMA) to appeal after that date. According to FNMAs announcement, in order to be successful in its appeal, a lender must provide documentation confirming reinstatement or continuation of coverage. This announcement could result in more repurchase requests from FNMA than the assumptions in the Corporations estimated liability contemplate. The Corporation also expects that in many cases (particularly in the context of individual or bulk rescissions being contested through litigation), it will not be able to resolve MI rescission notices with the mortgage insurance companies before the expiration of the appeal period prescribed by the FNMA announcement. The Corporation has informed FNMA that it does not believe that the new policy is valid under its contracts with FNMA, and that it does not intend to repurchase loans under the terms set forth in the new policy. The Corporations pipeline of outstanding repurchase claims from the GSEs resulting solely on MI rescission notices has increased during
2011
by
$935 million
to
$1.2 billion
at
December 31, 2011
. If it is required to abide by the terms of the new FNMA policy, the Corporations representations and warranties liability will likely increase.
At
December 31, 2011
, the Corporation had approximately
90,000
open MI rescission notices compared to
72,000
at
December 31, 2010
. Through
December 31, 2011
,
26 percent
of the MI rescission notices received have been resolved. Of those resolved,
24 percent
were resolved through the Corporations acceptance of the MI rescission,
46 percent
were resolved through reinstatement of coverage or payment of the claim by the mortgage insurance company, and
30 percent
were resolved on an aggregate basis through settlement, policy commutation or similar arrangement. As of
December 31, 2011
,
74 percent
of the MI rescission notices the Corporation has received have not yet been resolved. Of those not yet resolved,
48 percent
are implicated by ongoing litigation where no loan-level review is currently contemplated (nor required to preserve the Corporations legal rights). In this litigation, the litigating mortgage insurance companies are also seeking bulk rescission of certain policies, separate and apart from loan-by-loan denials or rescissions. The Corporation is in the process of reviewing
11 percent
of the remaining open MI rescission notices, and the Corporation has reviewed and is contesting the MI rescission with respect to
89 percent
of these remaining open MI rescission notices. Of the remaining open MI rescission notices,
29 percent
are also the
subject of ongoing litigation although, at present, these MI rescissions are being processed in a manner generally consistent with those not affected by litigation.
Cash Settlements
As presented in the Loan Repurchases and Indemnification Payments table, during
2011
and
2010
, the Corporation paid
$5.2 billion
and
$5.2 billion
to resolve
$6.2 billion
and
$6.6 billion
of repurchase claims through repurchase or reimbursement to the investor or securitization trust for losses they incurred, resulting in a loss on the related loans at the time of repurchase or reimbursement of
$3.5 billion
and
$3.5 billion
. Cash paid for loan repurchases includes the unpaid principal balance of the loan plus past due interest. The amount of loss for loan repurchases is reduced by the fair value of the underlying loan collateral. The repurchase of loans and indemnification payments related to first-lien and home equity repurchase claims generally resulted from material breaches of representations and warranties related to
 
the loans material compliance with the applicable underwriting standards, including borrower misrepresentation, credit exceptions without sufficient compensating factors and non-compliance with underwriting procedures. The actual representations and warranties made in a sales transaction and the resulting repurchase and indemnification activity can vary by transaction or investor. A direct relationship between the type of defect that causes the breach of representations and warranties and the severity of the realized loss has not been observed. Transactions to repurchase or indemnification payments related to first-lien residential mortgages primarily involved the GSEs while transactions to repurchase or indemnification payments for home equity loans primarily involved the monoline insurers. In addition to the amounts previously discussed, the Corporation paid
$1.0 billion
during
2011
to Assured Guaranty as part of the Assured Guaranty Settlement. The table below presents first-lien and home equity loan repurchases and indemnification payments for
2011
and
2010
.
Liability for Representations and Warranties and Corporate Guarantees
The liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related provision is included in mortgage banking income (loss). The Representations and Warranties and Corporate Guarantees table presents a rollforward of the liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees.
 
The liability for representations and warranties is established when those obligations are both probable and reasonably estimable. For
2011
, the provision for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees was
$15.6 billion
compared to
$6.8 billion
in
2010
. Of the
$15.6 billion
provision recorded in
2011
,
$8.6 billion
was attributable to the BNY Mellon Settlement and
$7.0 billion
was related to other exposures. The BNY Mellon Settlement led to the determination that the Corporation has sufficient experience to record a liability related to its exposure on certain other private-label securitizations. This determination combined with higher estimated GSE repurchase rates were the primary drivers of the balance of the provision in
2011
. GSE repurchase rates increased driven by higher than expected claims during
2011
, including claims on loans that defaulted more than
18
months prior to the repurchase request and on loans where the borrower has made a significant number of payments (e.g., at least
25
payments), in each case in numbers that were not expected based on historical claims.
Estimated Range of Possible Loss
Government-sponsored Enterprises
The Corporations estimated provision and liability at December 31, 2011, for obligations under representations and warranties given to the GSEs considers, among other things, and is necessarily dependent on and limited by, its historical claims experience with the GSEs. It includes the Corporations understanding of its agreements with the GSEs and projections of future defaults as well as certain other assumptions and judgmental factors. The Corporations estimate of the liability for these obligations has been accounted for in the recorded liability for representations and warranties for these loans. In recent periods, the Corporation has been experiencing elevated levels of new claims from the GSEs, including claims on loans on which borrowers have made a significant number of payments (e.g., at least
25
payments) or on loans which had defaulted more than
18
months prior to the repurchase request, in each case in numbers that were not expected based on historical experience. The criteria by which the GSEs are ultimately willing to resolve claims have changed in ways that are unfavorable to the Corporation. While the Corporation is seeking to resolve its differences with the GSEs concerning each partys interpretation of the requirements of the governing contracts, whether it will be able to achieve a resolution of these differences on acceptable terms and timing thereof, is subject to significant uncertainty. The Corporation intends repurchase loans to the extent required under the contracts and standards that govern its relationships with the GSEs.
The Corporation is not able to predict changes in the behavior of the GSEs based on the Corporations past experiences. Therefore, it is not possible to reasonably estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss with respect to any such potential impact in excess of current accrued liabilities.
Counterparties other than Government-sponsored Enterprises
The population of private-label securitizations included in the BNY Mellon Settlement encompasses almost all legacy Countrywide first-lien private-label securitizations including loans originated principally in the
2004
through
2008
vintage. For the remainder of the population of private-label securitizations, the Corporation believes it is probable that other claimants in certain types of securitizations may come forward with claims that meet the requirements of the terms of the securitizations. The Corporation has seen an increased trend in requests for loan files from private-label securitization trustees and an increase in repurchase claims from private-label securitization trustees that meet required standards. The Corporation believes that the provisions recorded in connection with the BNY Mellon Settlement and the additional non-GSE representations and warranties provisions recorded in
2011
have provided for a substantial portion of the Corporations non-GSE representations and warranties exposures. However, it is reasonably possible that future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the amounts recorded for these exposures. In addition, as discussed below, the Corporation has not recorded any representations and warranties liability for certain potential monoline exposures and certain potential whole-loan and other private-label securitization exposures. The Corporation currently estimates that the range of possible loss related to non-GSE representations and warranties exposure as of
December 31, 2011
, could be up to
$5 billion
over existing accruals. This
 
estimated range of possible loss for non-GSE representations and warranties does not represent a probable loss, and is based on currently available information, significant judgment and a number of assumptions, including those set forth below, that are subject to change.
The methodology used to estimate the non-GSE representations and warranties liability and the corresponding range of possible loss considers a variety of factors including the Corporations experience related to actual defaults, projected future defaults, historical loss experience, estimated home prices and other economic conditions. Among the factors that impact the non-GSE representations and warranties liability and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss are: (1) contractual material adverse effect requirements, (2) the representations and warranties provided and (3) the requirement to meet certain presentation thresholds. The first factor is based on the Corporations belief that a non-GSE contractual liability to repurchase a loan generally arises only if the counterparties prove there is a breach of representations and warranties that materially and adversely affects the interest of the investor or all investors, or of the monoline insurer or other financial guarantor (as applicable), in a securitization trust and, accordingly, the Corporation believes that the repurchase claimants must prove that the alleged representations and warranties breach was the cause of the loss. The second factor is related to the fact that non-GSE securitizations include different types of representations and warranties than those provided to the GSEs. The Corporation believes the non-GSE securitizations representations and warranties are less rigorous and actionable than the explicit provisions of comparable agreements with the GSEs without regard to any variations that may have arisen as a result of dealings with the GSEs. The third factor is related to the fact that certain presentation thresholds need to be met in order for any repurchase claim to be asserted on the initiative of investors under the non-GSE agreements. A securitization trustee may investigate or demand repurchase on its own action, and most agreements contain a threshold, for example
25 percent
of the voting rights per trust, that allows investors to declare a servicing event of default under certain circumstances or to request certain action, such as requesting loan files, that the trustee may choose to accept and follow, exempt from liability, provided the trustee is acting in good faith. If there is an uncured servicing event of default and the trustee fails to bring suit during a
60
-day period, then, under most agreements, investors may file suit. In addition to this, most agreements also allow investors to direct the securitization trustee to investigate loan files or demand the repurchase of loans if security holders hold a specified percentage, for example
25 percent
, of the voting rights of each tranche of the outstanding securities. Although the Corporation continues to believe that presentation thresholds are a factor in the determination of probable loss, given the BNY Mellon Settlement, the estimated range of possible loss assumes that the presentation threshold can be met for all of the non-GSE securitization transactions.
In addition, in the case of private-label securitizations, the methodology used to estimate the non-GSE representations and warranties liability and the corresponding range of possible loss considers the implied repurchase experience based on the BNY Mellon Settlement and assumes that the conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement are satisfied. Since the non-GSE transactions that were included in the BNY Mellon Settlement differ from those that were not included in the BNY Mellon Settlement, the Corporation adjusted the experience implied in the settlement in
order to determine the estimated non-GSE representations and warranties liability and the corresponding range of possible loss. The judgmental adjustments made include consideration of the differences in the mix of products in the securitizations, loan originator, likelihood of claims differences, the differences in the number of payments that the borrower has made prior to default and the sponsor of the securitization.
Future provisions and/or ranges of possible loss for non-GSE representations and warranties may be significantly impacted if actual experiences are different from the Corporations assumptions in its predictive models, including, without limitation, those regarding the ultimate resolution of the BNY Mellon Settlement, estimated repurchase rates, economic conditions, home prices, consumer and counterparty behavior, and a variety of judgmental factors. Adverse developments with respect to one or more of the assumptions underlying the liability for representations and warranties and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss could result in significant increases to future provisions and/or the estimated range of loss. For example, if courts were to disagree with the Corporations interpretation that the underlying agreements require a claimant to prove that the representations and warranties breach was the cause of the loss, it could significantly impact this estimated range of possible loss. For additional information, see
Note 14  Commitments and Contingencies
. Additionally, if recent court rulings related to monoline litigation, including one related to the Corporation, that have allowed sampling of loan files instead of requiring a loan-by-loan review to determine if a representations and warranties breach has occurred are followed generally by the courts, private-label securitization investors may view litigation as a more attractive alternative as compared to a loan-by-loan review. Finally, although the Corporation believes that the representations and warranties typically given in non-GSE transactions are less rigorous and actionable than those given in GSE transactions, the Corporation does not have significant loan-level experience in non-GSE transactions to measure the impact of these differences on the probability that a loan will be required to be repurchased.
The liability for obligations under representations and warranties with respect to GSE and non-GSE exposures and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss for non-GSE representations and warranties exposures does not include any losses related to litigation matters disclosed in
Note 14  Commitments and Contingencies
, nor do they include any separate foreclosure costs and related costs, assessments and compensatory fees or any possible losses related to potential claims for breaches of performance of servicing obligations (except as such losses are included as potential costs of the BNY Mellon Settlement), potential securities law or fraud claims or potential indemnity or other claims against the Corporation, including claims related to loans insured by the FHA. The Corporation is not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any possible loss with respect to any such servicing, securities law (except to the extent reflected in the aggregate range of possible loss for litigation and regulatory matters disclosed in
Note 14  Commitments and Contingencies
), fraud or other claims against the Corporation; however, such loss could be material.
Government-sponsored Enterprises Experience
The Corporation and its subsidiaries have an established history of working with the GSEs on repurchase claims. However, the GSEs repurchase requests, standards for rescission of repurchase
 
requests, and resolution processes have become increasingly inconsistent with GSEs prior conduct and the Corporations interpretation of its contractual obligations. Notably, in recent periods, the Corporation has been experiencing elevated levels of new claims, including claims on loans on which borrowers have made a significant number of payments (e.g., at least
25
payments) or on loans which had defaulted more than
18
months prior to the repurchase request, in each case, in numbers that were not expected based on historical experience. Additionally, the criteria and the processes by which the GSEs are ultimately willing to resolve claims have changed in ways that are unfavorable to the Corporation. These developments have resulted in an increase in claims outstanding from the GSEs. The Corporation intends to repurchase loans to the extent required under the contracts and standards that govern its relationship with the GSEs. For additional information, see
Mortgage Insurance Rescission Notices
in this Note on page
59
.
Generally, the Corporation first becomes aware that a GSE is evaluating a particular loan for repurchase when the Corporation receives a request from a GSE to review the underlying loan file (file request). Upon completing its review, the GSE may submit a repurchase claim to the Corporation. As soon as practicable after receiving a repurchase claim from either of the GSEs, the Corporation evaluates the claim and takes appropriate action. Claim disputes are generally handled through loan-level negotiations with the GSEs and the Corporation seeks to resolve the repurchase claim within
90 to 120
days of the receipt of the claim although tolerances exist for claims that remain open beyond this timeframe. Disputes include reasonableness of stated income, occupancy, undisclosed liabilities, and the validity of MI claim rescissions in the vintages with the highest default rates.
Monoline Insurers Experience
Experience with most of the monoline insurers has been varied and the protocols and experience with these counterparties has not been predictable. The timetable for the loan file request, the repurchase claim, if any, response and resolution vary by monoline. Where a breach of representations and warranties given by the Corporation or subsidiaries or legacy companies is confirmed on a given loan, settlement is generally reached as to that loan within
60 to 90
days.
The Corporation generally reviews properly presented repurchase claims from the monolines on a loan-by-loan basis. As part of an ongoing claims process, if the Corporation does not believe a claim is valid, it will deny the claim and generally indicate the reason for the denial to facilitate meaningful dialogue with the counterparty although it is not contractually obligated to do so. When there is disagreement as to the resolution of a claim, meaningful dialogue and negotiation is generally necessary between the parties to reach conclusion on an individual claim. Although the Assured Guaranty Settlement does not cover all securitizations where Assured Guaranty and subsidiaries provided insurance, it covers the transactions that resulted in repurchase requests from this monoline. As a result, the on-going claims process with counterparties with a more consistent repurchase experience is substantially complete.
The remaining monolines have instituted litigation against legacy Countrywide and Bank of America. When claims from these counterparties are denied, the Corporation does not indicate its reason for denial as it is not contractually obligated to do so. In the Corporations experience, the monolines have been generally
unwilling to withdraw repurchase claims, regardless of whether and what evidence was offered to refute a claim.
The pipeline of unresolved monoline claims where the Corporation believes a valid defect has not been identified which would constitute an actionable breach of representations and warranties decreased during
2011
as a result of the Assured Guaranty Settlement. Through
December 31, 2011
, approximately
30 percent
of monoline claims that the Corporation initially denied have subsequently been resolved through the Assured Guaranty Settlement,
10 percent
through repurchase or make-whole payments and
one percent
through rescission. When a claim has been denied and there has not been communication with the counterparty for six months, the Corporation views these claims as inactive; however, they remain in the outstanding claims balance until resolution.
To the extent there are repurchase claims based on valid identified loan defects and for repurchase claims that are in the process of review, a liability for representations and warranties is established. For repurchase claims in the process of review, the liability is based on historical repurchase experience with specific monoline insurers to the extent such experience provides a reasonable basis on which to estimate incurred losses from repurchase activity. In prior periods, a liability was established for Assured Guaranty related to repurchase claims subject to negotiation and unasserted claims to repurchase current and future defaulted loans. The Assured Guaranty Settlement resolved this representations and warranties liability with the liability for the related loss sharing reinsurance arrangement being recorded in other accrued liabilities. With respect to the other monoline insurers, the Corporation has had limited experience in the repurchase process as these monoline insurers have instituted litigation against legacy Countrywide and Bank of America, which limits the Corporations ability to enter into constructive dialogue with these monolines to resolve the open claims. For these monolines, in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of those repurchase claims where a valid defect has not been identified or in predicting future claim requests and the related outcome in the case of unasserted claims to repurchase loans from the securitization trusts in which these monolines have insured all or some of the related bonds, the Corporation cannot reasonably estimate the eventual outcome through the repurchase process. In addition, the timing of the ultimate resolution or the eventual loss through the repurchase process, if any, related to those repurchase claims cannot be reasonably estimated. Thus, with respect to these monolines, a liability for representations and warranties has not been established related to repurchase claims where a valid defect has not been identified, or in the case of any unasserted claims to repurchase loans from the securitization trusts in which such monolines have insured all or some of the related bonds. For additional information related to the monolines, see
Note 14  Commitments and Contingencies
.
Monoline Outstanding Claims
At
December 31, 2011
, for loans originated between
2004
and
2008
, the unpaid principal balance of loans related to unresolved monoline repurchase claims was
$3.1 billion
, substantially all of which the Corporation has reviewed and declined to repurchase based on an assessment of whether a material breach exists. As noted above, a portion of the repurchase claims that are initially denied are ultimately resolved through bulk settlement, repurchase or make-whole payments, after additional dialogue and negotiation with the monoline insurer. At
December 31, 2011
, the
 
unpaid principal balance of loans in these vintages for which the monolines had requested loan files for review but for which no repurchase claim had been received was
$6.1 billion
, excluding loans that had been paid in full and file requests for loans included in the trusts settled with Assured Guaranty. There will likely be additional requests for loan files in the future leading to repurchase claims. Such claims may relate to loans that are currently in securitization trusts or loans that have defaulted and are no longer included in the unpaid principal balance of the loans in the trusts. However, it is unlikely that a repurchase claim will be received for every loan in a securitization or every file requested or that a valid defect exists for every loan repurchase claim. In addition, amounts paid on repurchase claims from a monoline are paid to the securitization trust and are applied in accordance with the terms of the governing securitization documents which may include use by the securitization trust to repay any outstanding monoline advances or reduce future advances from the monolines. To the extent that a monoline has not advanced funds or does not anticipate that it will be required to advance funds to the securitization trust, the likelihood of receiving a repurchase claim from a monoline may be reduced as the monoline would receive limited or no benefit from the payment of repurchase claims. Moreover, some monolines are not currently performing their obligations under the financial guaranty policies they issued which may, in certain circumstances, impact their ability to present repurchase claims, although in those circumstances, investors may be able to bring claims if contractual thresholds are met.
Whole Loan Sales and Private-label Securitizations Experience
The majority of the repurchase claims that the Corporation has received outside of those from the GSEs and monolines are from third-party whole-loan investors. In connection with these transactions, the Corporation provided representations and warranties and the whole-loan investors may retain those rights even when the loans were aggregated with other collateral into private-label securitizations sponsored by the whole-loan investors. The Corporation reviews properly presented repurchase claims for these whole loans on a loan-by-loan basis. If, after the Corporations review, it does not believe a claim is valid, it will deny the claim and generally indicate a reason for the denial. When the counterparty agrees with the Corporations denial of the claim, the counterparty may rescind the claim. When there is disagreement as to the resolution of the claim, meaningful dialogue and negotiation between the parties is generally necessary to reach conclusion on an individual claim. Generally, a whole-loan sale claimant is engaged in the repurchase process and the Corporation and the claimant reach resolution, either through loan-by-loan negotiation or at times, through a bulk settlement. Through
December 31, 2011
,
25 percent
of the whole-loan claims that the Corporation initially denied have subsequently been resolved through repurchase or make-whole payments and
50 percent
have been resolved through rescission or repayment in full by the borrower. Although the timeline for resolution varies, once an actionable breach is identified on a given loan, settlement is generally reached as to that loan within
60 to 90
days. When a claim has been denied and the Corporation does not have communication with the counterparty for six months, the Corporation views these claims as inactive; however, they remain in the outstanding claims balance until resolution.
In private-label securitizations, certain presentation thresholds
need to be met in order for any repurchase claim to be asserted by investors. In
2011
, there was an increase in repurchase claims from private-label securitization trustees that meet the required standards. During
2011
, the Corporation received
$2.1 billion
of such repurchase claims. In addition, there has been an increase in requests for loan files from private-label securitization trustees, as well as requests for tolling agreements to toll the applicable statutes of limitation relating to representations and warranties claims, and the Corporation believes it is likely that these requests will lead to an increase in repurchase claims from private-label securitization trustees that meet required standards. The representations and warranties, as governed by the private-label securitization agreements, generally require that counterparties have the ability to both assert a claim and actually prove that a loan has an actionable defect under the applicable contracts. While the Corporation believes the agreements for private-label securitizations generally contain less rigorous representations and warranties and place higher burdens on investors seeking repurchases than the express provisions of comparable agreements with the GSEs without regard to any variations that may have arisen as a result of dealings with the GSEs, the agreements generally include a representation that underwriting practices were prudent and customary.
During 2010, the Corporation received claim demands totaling
$1.7 billion
from private-label securitization investors in the Covered Trusts. Non-GSE investors generally do not have the contractual right to demand repurchase of the loans directly or the right to access loan files. The inclusion of the
$1.7 billion
in outstanding claims, as reflected in the table on page
59
, does not mean that the Corporation believes these claims have satisfied the contractual thresholds required for the private-label securitization investors to direct the securitization trustee to take action or that these claims are otherwise procedurally or substantively valid. One of these claimants has filed litigation against the Corporation relating to certain of these claims; the claims in this litigation would be extinguished if there is final court approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement.
NOTE 10 
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill
The Goodwill table presents goodwill balances by business segment at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
. Effective January 1, 2012, the Corporation changed its basis of presentation from six to five segments. For more information on this realignment, see
Note 26  Business Segment Information
. The reporting units utilized for goodwill impairment tests are the business segments or one level below. The majority of the decline in goodwill during
2011
was due to goodwill impairment charges as described in this Note.
 
International Consumer Card Businesses
In connection with the Corporations announcement on August 15, 2011 of its intention to exit the international consumer card businesses, goodwill of approximately
$1.9 billion
was allocated, on a relative fair value basis, from the Card Services reporting unit within
Consumer & Business Banking (CBB)
to
All Other
as of September 30, 2011. Of the
$1.9 billion
of goodwill allocated to the international consumer card businesses,
$526 million
of goodwill was allocated, on a relative fair value basis, to the Canadian consumer card business which was sold on December 1, 2011.
During the
three months ended December 31, 2011
, a goodwill impairment test was performed for the European consumer card businesses reporting unit as it was likely that the carrying amount of the businesses exceeded the fair value due to a decrease in estimated future growth projections. The Corporation concluded that goodwill was impaired, and accordingly, recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of
$581 million
for the European consumer card businesses.
Consumer Real Estate Services
In connection with the sale of Balboa Insurance Companys lender-placed insurance business on June 1, 2011, the Corporation allocated, on a relative fair value basis,
$193 million
of
CRES
goodwill to the business in determining the gain on the sale.
During the
three months ended June 30, 2011
, as a consequence of the BNY Mellon Settlement entered into by the Corporation on June 28, 2011, the adverse impact of the incremental mortgage-related charges, and the continued economic slowdown in the mortgage business, the Corporation performed a goodwill impairment test for the
CRES
reporting unit. The Corporation concluded that the remaining balance of goodwill of
$2.6 billion
was impaired, and accordingly, recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill in
CRES
to
zero
.
2011
Annual Impairment Test
During the
three months ended September 30, 2011
, the Corporation completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of
June 30, 2011
for all reporting units. Based on the results of step one of the annual goodwill impairment test, the Corporation determined that step two was not required for any of the reporting units as their fair value exceeded their carrying value indicating there was no impairment. The realignment of the reportable segments did not have a material impact on the conclusions of the
2011
annual goodwill impairment test. For more information on the realignment of the segments, see
Note 26  Business Segment Information
.
2010
Impairment Tests
In
2010
, the Corporation performed a goodwill impairment test for the Card Services reporting unit within
CBB
due to the continued stress on the business and the uncertain debit card interchange provisions under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Financial Reform Act). The Corporation concluded that goodwill was impaired, and accordingly, recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of
$10.4 billion
to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill in the Card Services reporting unit within
CBB
.
During the three months ended December 31, 2010, the Corporation performed a goodwill impairment test for the
CRES
reporting unit as it was likely that there was a decline in its fair value as a result of increased uncertainties, including existing and potential litigation exposure and other related risks, higher servicing costs including those related to loss mitigation, foreclosure related issues and the redeployment of centralized sales resources. The Corporation concluded that goodwill was
 
impaired, and accordingly, recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of
$2.0 billion
in
CRES
.
Intangible Assets
The table below presents the gross carrying amounts and accumulated amortization related to intangible assets at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
.
Excluded from
2011
amounts are
$3.2 billion
of fully amortized intangible assets and
$396 million
of intangible assets sold as part of the consumer credit card portfolio sales that occurred during the year.
None of the intangible assets were impaired at
December 31, 2011
or
2010
. Amortization of intangibles expense was
$1.5
 
billion
,
$1.7 billion
and
$2.0 billion
in
2011
,
2010
and
2009
, respectively. The Corporation estimates aggregate amortization expense will be approximately
$1.3 billion
,
$1.1 billion
,
$1.0 billion
,
$870 million
and
$770 million
for
2012
through
2016
, respectively.
NOTE 11 
Deposits
The Corporation had U.S. certificates of deposit and other U.S. time deposits of $100 thousand or more totaling
$50.8 billion
and
$60.5 billion
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. Non-U.S. certificates of deposit and other non-U.S. time deposits of $100 thousand or more totaled
$34.0 billion
and
$40.6 billion
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. The table below presents the contractual maturities for time deposits of $100 thousand or more at

Federal Funds Sold, Securities Borrowed or Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Short-term Borrowings
The table below presents federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and short-term borrowings which include federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings.
n/a = not applicable
Bank of America, N.A. maintains a global program to offer up to a maximum of
$75 billion
outstanding at any one time, of bank notes with fixed or floating rates and maturities of at least seven days from the date of issue. Short-term bank notes outstanding under this program totaled
$6.3 billion
and
$13.8 billion
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. These short-term bank notes,
 
along with Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances, U.S. Treasury tax and loan notes, and term federal funds purchased, are included in commercial paper and other short-term borrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See
Note 13  Long-term Debt
for information regarding the long-term notes that have been issued under the
$75 billion
bank note program.
NOTE 13 
Long-term Debt
Long-term debt consists of borrowings having an original maturity of one year or more. The table below presents the balance of long-term debt at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, and the related contractual rates and maturity dates at
December 31, 2011
.
Bank of America Corporation, Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. and subsidiaries, and Bank of America, N.A. maintain various U.S. and non-U.S. debt programs to offer both senior and subordinated notes. The notes may be denominated in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, the amount of foreign currency-denominated debt translated into U.S. dollars included in total long-term debt was
$117.0 billion
and
$145.9 billion
. Foreign currency contracts are used to convert certain
 
foreign currency-denominated debt into U.S. dollars.
At
December 31, 2011
, long-term debt of consolidated VIEs included credit card, automobile, home equity and other VIEs of
$33.1 billion
,
$2.9 billion
,
$3.1 billion
and
$10.0 billion
, respectively. Long-term debt of VIEs is collateralized by the assets of the VIEs. For more information, see
Note 8  Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities
.
The majority of the floating rates are based on three- and six-month LIBOR.
At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, Bank of America Corporation had approximately
$69.8 billion
and
$88.4 billion
of authorized, but unissued corporate debt and other securities under its existing U.S. shelf registration statements. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, Bank of America, N.A. had approximately
$62.4 billion
and
$54.1 billion
of authorized, but unissued bank notes under its existing
$75 billion
bank note program. Long-term bank notes issued and outstanding under the program totaled
$6.3 billion
and
$7.1 billion
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. At both
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, Bank of America, N.A. had approximately
$20.6 billion
of authorized, but unissued mortgage notes under its
$30.0 billion
mortgage bond program.
The weighted-average effective interest rates for total long-term debt (excluding senior structured notes), total fixed-rate debt and total floating-rate debt, were
4.35 percent
,
5.17 percent
and
1.38 percent
, respectively, at
December 31, 2011
and
3.96 percent
,
5.02 percent
and
1.09 percent
, respectively, at
December 31, 2010
. The Corporations ALM activities maintain an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts to manage fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporations goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest
 
rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. The above weighted-average rates are the contractual interest rates on the debt and do not reflect the impacts of derivative transactions.
The weighted-average interest rate for debt, excluding senior structured notes, issued by Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. and subsidiaries was
4.74 percent
and
4.11 percent
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. As of
December 31, 2011
, the Corporation has not assumed or guaranteed the
$105.6 billion
of long-term debt that was issued or guaranteed by Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. or its subsidiaries prior to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch by the Corporation. All existing Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. guarantees of securities issued by certain Merrill Lynch subsidiaries under various non-U.S. securities offering programs will remain in full force and effect as long as those securities are outstanding, and the Corporation has not assumed any of those prior Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. guarantees or otherwise guaranteed such securities.
Certain senior structured notes are accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on these senior structured notes, see
Note 23  Fair Value Option
.
The table below represents the carrying value for aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt at
December 31, 2011
.
Included in the above table are certain structured notes that contain provisions whereby the borrowings are redeemable at the option of the holder (put options) at specified dates prior to maturity. Other structured notes have coupon or repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities and the maturity may be accelerated based on the value of a referenced index or security. In both cases, the Corporation or a subsidiary may be required to settle the obligation for cash or other securities prior to the contractual maturity date. These borrowings are reflected in the above table as maturing at their earliest put or redemption date.
Trust Preferred and Hybrid Securities
Trust preferred securities (Trust Securities) are primarily issued by trust companies (the Trusts) that are not consolidated. These Trust Securities are mandatorily redeemable preferred security obligations of the Trusts. The sole assets of the Trusts generally are junior subordinated deferrable interest notes of the Corporation or its subsidiaries (the Notes). The Trusts generally are 100 percent-owned finance subsidiaries of the Corporation. Obligations associated with the Notes are included in the long-term debt table on page
67
.
Certain of the Trust Securities were issued at a discount and may be redeemed prior to maturity at the option of the Corporation. The Trusts generally have invested the proceeds of such Trust Securities in the Notes. Each issue of the Notes has an interest rate equal to the corresponding Trust Securities distribution rate.
 
The Corporation has the right to defer payment of interest on the Notes at any time or from time to time for a period not exceeding five years provided that no extension period may extend beyond the stated maturity of the relevant Notes. During any such extension period, distributions on the Trust Securities will also be deferred and the Corporations ability to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock will be restricted.
The Trust Securities generally are subject to mandatory redemption upon repayment of the related Notes at their stated maturity dates or their earlier redemption at a redemption price equal to their liquidation amount plus accrued distributions to the date fixed for redemption and the premium, if any, paid by the Corporation upon concurrent repayment of the related Notes.
Periodic cash payments and payments upon liquidation or redemption with respect to Trust Securities are guaranteed by the Corporation or its subsidiaries to the extent of funds held by the Trusts (the Preferred Securities Guarantee). The Preferred Securities Guarantee, when taken together with the Corporations other obligations including its obligations under the Notes, generally will constitute a full and unconditional guarantee, on a subordinated basis, by the Corporation of payments due on the Trust Securities.
Hybrid Income Term Securities (HITS) totaling
$1.6 billion
were issued by the Trusts to institutional investors during 2007. The BAC Capital Trust XIII Floating-Rate Preferred HITS had a distribution rate of
three-month LIBOR
plus
40
bps and the BAC Capital Trust XIV Fixed-to-Floating Rate Preferred HITS had an initial distribution rate of
5.63 percent
. Both series of HITS represent
beneficial interests in the assets of the respective capital trust, which consist of a series of the Corporations junior subordinated notes and a stock purchase contract for a specified series of the Corporations preferred stock. The Corporation will remarket the junior subordinated notes underlying each series of HITS on or about the five-year anniversary of the issuance to obtain sufficient funds for the capital trusts to buy the Corporations preferred stock under the stock purchase contracts. Following the successful remarketing of the notes and the subsequent purchase of the Corporations preferred stock under the stock purchase contracts, the preferred stock will constitute the sole asset of the applicable trust.
In connection with the HITS, the Corporation entered into two replacement capital covenants for the benefit of investors in certain series of the Corporations long-term indebtedness (Covered Debt). As of
December 31, 2011
, the Corporations
6.625%
Junior Subordinated Notes due
2036
constitute the Covered Debt under the covenant corresponding to the Floating-Rate Preferred HITS and the Corporations
5.625%
Junior Subordinated Notes due
2035
constitute the Covered Debt under the covenant corresponding to the Fixed-to-Floating Rate Preferred HITS. These covenants generally restrict the ability of the Corporation and its subsidiaries to redeem or purchase the HITS and related securities unless the Corporation has obtained the prior approval of the Federal Reserve if required under the Federal Reserves capital guidelines, the redemption or purchase price of the HITS does not exceed the amount received by the Corporation from the sale of certain qualifying securities, and such replacement securities qualify as Tier 1 capital and are not restricted core capital elements under the Federal Reserves guidelines.
In 2011, as part of the exchange agreements described in
Note 15  Shareholders Equity
, the Corporation issued
282 million
shares of common stock valued at
$1.6 billion
and senior notes valued at
$1.5 billion
in exchange for
$3.8 billion
aggregate liquidation amount of previously issued Trust Securities. Upon the exchange, the Corporation immediately surrendered the Trust Securities to the unconsolidated Trusts for cancellation, resulting in the cancellation of an equal amount of junior subordinated notes that had a carrying value of
$4.3 billion
, resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt of
$1.2 billion
. In addition, the Corporation issued
26 million
shares of common stock valued at
$138 million
and senior notes valued at
$505 million
in exchange for
$917 million
aggregate liquidation amount of HITS. Upon the exchange, the Corporation immediately surrendered the HITS to the unconsolidated Trusts for cancellation, resulting in the cancellation of an equal amount of junior subordinated notes that had a carrying value of
$915 million
, and the cancellation of a corresponding
 
amount of the underlying stock purchase contract, resulting in a
$12 million
loss on extinguishment of debt and an increase to additional paid-in capital of
$284 million
. For additional information regarding these exchanges, see
Note 15  Shareholders Equity
.
The table below lists each series of Trust Securities or HITS, and the corresponding aggregate liquidation preference covered by the Exchange Agreements.

NOTE 14 
Commitments and Contingencies
In the normal course of business, the Corporation enters into a number of off-balance sheet commitments. These commitments expose the Corporation to varying degrees of credit and market risk and are subject to the same credit and market risk limitation reviews as those instruments recorded on the Corporations Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Credit Extension Commitments
The Corporation enters into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, SBLC and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of its customers. The table below includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments net of amounts distributed (e.g., syndicated) to other financial institutions of
$27.1 billion
and
$23.3 billion
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. At
December 31, 2011
, the
 
carrying amount of these commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option, was
$741 million
, including deferred revenue of
$27 million
and a reserve for unfunded lending commitments of
$714 million
. At
December 31, 2010
, the comparable amounts were
$1.2 billion
,
$29 million
and
$1.2 billion
, respectively. The carrying amount of these commitments is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The table below also includes the notional amount of commitments of
$25.7 billion
and
$27.3 billion
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
that are accounted for under the fair value option. However, the table below excludes fair value adjustments of
$1.2 billion
and
$866 million
on these commitments, which are classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities. For information regarding the Corporations loan commitments accounted for under the fair value option, see
Note 23  Fair Value Option
.
Legally binding commitments to extend credit generally have specified rates and maturities. Certain of these commitments have adverse change clauses that help to protect the Corporation against deterioration in the borrowers ability to pay.
Other Commitments
Global Principal Investments and Other Equity Investments
At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Corporation had unfunded equity investment commitments of
$772 million
and
$1.5 billion
. In light of proposed Basel regulatory capital changes related to unfunded commitments over the past two years, the Corporation has actively reduced these commitments in a series of sale transactions involving its private equity fund investments.
 
Other Commitments
At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Corporation had commitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and commercial real estate) of
$2.5 billion
and
$2.6 billion
which upon settlement will be included in loans or LHFS.
At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Corporation had commitments to enter into forward-dated resale and securities borrowing agreements of
$67.0 billion
and
$39.4 billion
. In addition, the Corporation had commitments to enter into forward-dated repurchase and securities lending agreements of
$42.0 billion
and
$33.5 billion
. All of these commitments expire within the next 12 months.
The Corporation is a party to operating leases for certain of its premises and equipment. Commitments under these leases are approximately
$3.0 billion
,
$2.6 billion
,
$2.0 billion
,
$1.6 billion
and
$1.3 billion
for
2012
through
2016
, respectively, and
$6.1 billion
in the aggregate for all years thereafter.
The Corporation has entered into agreements with providers of market data, communications, systems consulting and other office-related services. At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the minimum fee commitments over the remaining terms of these agreements totaled
$1.9 billion
and
$2.1 billion
.
Other Guarantees
Bank-owned Life Insurance Book Value Protection
The Corporation sells products that offer book value protection to insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to corporations, primarily banks. The book value protection is provided on portfolios of intermediate investment-grade fixed-income securities and is intended to cover any shortfall in the event that policyholders surrender their policies and market value is below book value. To manage its exposure, the Corporation imposes significant restrictions on surrenders and the manner in which the portfolio is liquidated and the funds are accessed. In addition, investment parameters of the underlying portfolio are restricted. These constraints, combined with structural protections, including a cap on the amount of risk assumed on each policy, are designed to provide adequate buffers and guard against payments even under extreme stress scenarios. These guarantees are recorded as derivatives and carried at fair value in the trading portfolio. At both
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled
$15.8 billion
and the Corporations maximum exposure related to these guarantees totaled
$5.1 billion
and
$5.0 billion
with estimated maturity dates between 2030 and 2040. As of
December 31, 2011
, the Corporation had not made a payment under these products. The possibility of surrender or other payment associated with these guarantees exists. The net fair value of the liability associated with these guarantees was
$48 million
and
$78 million
at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
and reflects the probability of surrender as well as the multiple structural protection features in the contracts.
Employee Retirement Protection
The Corporation sells products that offer book value protection primarily to plan sponsors of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) governed pension plans, such as 401(k) plans and 457 plans. The book value protection is provided on portfolios of intermediate/short-term investment-grade fixed-income securities and is intended to cover any shortfall in the event that plan participants continue to withdraw funds after all securities have been liquidated and there is remaining book value. The Corporation retains the option to exit the contract at any time. If the Corporation exercises its option, the purchaser can require the Corporation to purchase high-quality fixed-income securities, typically government or government-backed agency securities, with the proceeds of the liquidated assets to assure the return of principal. To manage its exposure, the Corporation imposes significant restrictions and constraints on the timing of the withdrawals, the manner in which the portfolio is liquidated and the funds are accessed, and the investment parameters of the underlying portfolio. These constraints, combined with structural protections, are designed to provide adequate buffers and guard against payments even under extreme stress scenarios. These guarantees are recorded as derivatives and carried at fair value in the trading portfolio. At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled
$28.8 billion
and
$33.8 billion
with estimated maturity dates up to 2015 if the exit
 
option is exercised on all deals. As of
December 31, 2011
, the Corporation had not made a payment under these products.
Indemnifications
In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation enters into various agreements that contain indemnifications, such as tax indemnifications, whereupon payment may become due if certain external events occur, such as a change in tax law. The indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and were entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss would be remote. These agreements typically contain an early termination clause that permits the Corporation to exit the agreement upon these events. The maximum potential future payment under indemnification agreements is difficult to assess for several reasons, including the occurrence of an external event, the inability to predict future changes in tax and other laws, the difficulty in determining how such laws would apply to parties in contracts, the absence of exposure limits contained in standard contract language and the timing of the early termination clause. Historically, any payments made under these guarantees have been de minimis. The Corporation has assessed the probability of making such payments in the future as remote.
Merchant Services
During 2009, the Corporation contributed its merchant services business to a joint venture in exchange for a
46.5 percent
ownership interest in the joint venture. In 2010, the joint venture purchased the interest held by one of the three initial investors bringing the Corporations ownership interest up to
49 percent
. For additional information on the joint venture agreement, see
Note 5  Securities
.
In accordance with credit and debit card association rules, the Corporation sponsors merchant processing servicers that process credit and debit card transactions on behalf of various merchants. In connection with these services, a liability may arise in the event of a billing dispute between the merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the cardholders favor. If the merchant defaults on its obligation to reimburse the cardholder, the cardholder, through its issuing bank, generally has until six months after the date of the transaction to present a chargeback to the merchant processor, which is primarily liable for any losses on covered transactions. However, if the merchant processor fails to meet its obligation to reimburse the cardholder for disputed transactions, then the Corporation, as the sponsor, could be held liable for the disputed amount. In
2011
and
2010
, the sponsored entities processed and settled
$460.4 billion
and
$339.4 billion
of transactions and recorded losses of
$11 million
and
$17 million
. At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Corporation held as collateral
$238 million
and
$25 million
of merchant escrow deposits which may be used to offset amounts due from the individual merchants.
The Corporation believes that the maximum potential exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure. The Corporation believes the maximum potential exposure for chargebacks would not exceed the total amount of merchant transactions processed through Visa, MasterCard and Discover for the last six months, which represents the claim period for the cardholder, plus any outstanding delayed-delivery transactions. As of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the maximum potential exposure for sponsored transactions totaled approximately
$236.0 billion
and
$139.5 billion
. The Corporation does not expect to make material payments in connection with these guarantees.
Other Derivative Contracts
The Corporation funds selected assets, including securities issued by CDOs and CLOs, through derivative contracts, typically total return swaps, with third parties and VIEs that are not consolidated on the Corporations Consolidated Balance Sheet. At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the total notional amount of these derivative contracts was approximately
$3.2 billion
and
$4.3 billion
with commercial banks and
$1.8 billion
and
$1.7 billion
with VIEs. The underlying securities are senior securities and substantially all of the Corporations exposures are insured. Accordingly, the Corporations exposure to loss consists principally of counterparty risk to the insurers. In certain circumstances, generally as a result of ratings downgrades, the Corporation may be required to purchase the underlying assets, which would not result in additional gain or loss to the Corporation as such exposure is already reflected in the fair value of the derivative contracts.
Other Guarantees
The Corporation sells products that guarantee the return of principal to investors at a preset future date. These guarantees cover a broad range of underlying asset classes and are designed to cover the shortfall between the market value of the underlying portfolio and the principal amount on the preset future date. To manage its exposure, the Corporation requires that these guarantees be backed by structural and investment constraints and certain pre-defined triggers that would require the underlying assets or portfolio to be liquidated and invested in zero-coupon bonds that mature at the preset future date. The Corporation is required to fund any shortfall between the proceeds of the liquidated assets and the purchase price of the zero-coupon bonds at the preset future date. These guarantees are recorded as derivatives and carried at fair value in the trading portfolio. At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled
$300 million
and
$666 million
. These guarantees have various maturities ranging from two to five years. As of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Corporation had not made a payment under these products and has assessed the probability of payments under these guarantees as remote.
The Corporation has entered into additional guarantee agreements and commitments, including lease-end obligation agreements, partial credit guarantees on certain leases, real estate joint venture guarantees, sold risk participation swaps, divested business commitments and sold put options that require gross settlement. The maximum potential future payment under these agreements was approximately
$3.7 billion
and
$3.4 billion
at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
. The estimated maturity dates of these obligations extend up to 2033. The Corporation has made no material payments under these guarantees.
In the normal course of business, the Corporation periodically guarantees the obligations of its affiliates in a variety of transactions including ISDA-related transactions and non ISDA-related transactions such as commodities trading, repurchase agreements, prime brokerage agreements and other transactions.
 
Payment Protection Insurance Claims Matter
In the U.K., the Corporation sells payment protection insurance (PPI) through its international card services business to credit card customers and has previously sold this insurance to consumer loan customers. PPI covers a consumers loan for debt repayment if certain events occur such as loss of job or illness. In response to an elevated level of customer complaints of misleading sales tactics across the industry, heightened media coverage and pressure from consumer advocacy groups, the U.K. Financial Services Authority (FSA) investigated and raised concerns about the way some companies have handled complaints relating to the sale of these insurance policies. In August 2010, the FSA issued a policy statement (the FSA Policy Statement) on the assessment and remediation of PPI claims that is applicable to the Corporations U.K. consumer businesses and is intended to address concerns among consumers and regulators regarding the handling of PPI complaints across the industry. The FSA Policy Statement sets standards for the sale of PPI that apply to current and prior sales, and in the event a company does not or did not comply with the standards, it is alleged that the insurance was incorrectly sold, giving the customer rights to remedies. The FSA Policy Statement also requires companies to review their sales practices and to proactively remediate non-complaining customers if evidence of a systematic breach of the newly articulated sales standards is discovered, which could include refunding premiums paid.
In October 2010, the British Bankers Association (BBA), on behalf of its members, including the Corporation, challenged the provisions of the FSA Policy Statement and its retroactive application to sales of PPI to U.K. consumers through a judicial review process against the FSA and the U.K. Financial Ombudsman Service. On April 20, 2011, the U.K. court issued a judgment upholding the FSA Policy Statement as promulgated and dismissing the BBAs challenge. The BBA did not appeal the decision. Following the conclusion of the judicial review and the subsequent completion of the detailed root cause analysis as required by the FSA Policy Statement, the Corporation reassessed its reserve for PPI claims during 2010. The total accrued liability was
$476 million
and
$700 million
at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
.
Litigation and Regulatory Matters
In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to many pending and threatened legal actions and proceedings, including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants. These actions and proceedings are generally based on alleged violations of consumer protection, securities, environmental, banking, employment, contract and other laws. In some of these actions and proceedings, claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted against the Corporation and its subsidiaries.
In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are also subject to regulatory examinations, information gathering requests, inquiries and investigations. Certain subsidiaries of the Corporation are registered broker/dealers or investment advisors and are subject to regulation by
the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the New York Stock Exchange, the FSA and other domestic, international and state securities regulators. In connection with formal and informal inquiries by those agencies, such subsidiaries receive numerous requests, subpoenas and orders for documents, testimony and information in connection with various aspects of their regulated activities.
In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such litigation and regulatory matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties, the Corporation generally cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be, or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter may be.
In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Corporation establishes an accrued liability for litigation and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. When a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, the Corporation does not establish an accrued liability. As a litigation or regulatory matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates on an ongoing basis whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable. If, at the time of evaluation, the loss contingency related to a litigation or regulatory matter is not both probable and estimable, the matter will continue to be monitored for further developments that would make such loss contingency both probable and estimable. Once the loss contingency related to a litigation or regulatory matter is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability with respect to such loss contingency and record a corresponding amount of litigation-related expense. The Corporation continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established. Excluding expenses of internal or external legal service providers, litigation-related expense of
$5.6 billion
was recognized for
2011
compared to
$2.6 billion
for
2010
.
For a limited number of the matters disclosed in this Note for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, the Corporation is able to estimate a range of possible loss. In determining whether it is possible to provide an estimate of loss or range of possible loss, the Corporation reviews and evaluates its material litigation and regulatory matters on an ongoing basis, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. These may include information learned through the discovery process, rulings on dispositive motions, settlement discussions, and other rulings by courts, arbitrators or others. In cases in which the Corporation possesses sufficient appropriate information to develop an estimate of loss or range of possible loss, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed below. There may be other disclosed matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but such an estimate may not be possible. For those matters where an estimate is possible, management currently estimates the aggregate range of possible loss is
$0
to
$3.6 billion
in excess of the accrued liability (if any) related to those matters. This estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions, and known and unknown
 
uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. Those matters for which an estimate is not possible are not included within this estimated range. Therefore, this estimated range of possible loss represents what the Corporation believes to be an estimate of possible loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria. It does not represent the Corporations maximum loss exposure. Information is provided below regarding the nature of all of these contingencies and, where specified, the amount of the claim associated with these loss contingencies. Based on current knowledge, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters, including the matters described herein, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the Corporation. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, some of which are beyond the Corporations control, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to the Corporations results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period.
Auction Rate Securities Litigation
Since October 2007, the Corporation, Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates have been named as defendants in a variety of lawsuits and other proceedings brought by customers and both individual and institutional investors regarding auction rate securities (ARS). These actions generally allege that defendants: (i) misled plaintiffs into believing that there was a deeply liquid market for ARS, and (ii) failed to adequately disclose their or their affiliates practice of placing their own bids to support ARS auctions. Plaintiffs assert that ARS auctions started failing from August 2007 through February 2008 when defendants and other broker/dealers stopped placing those support bids. In addition to the matters described in more detail below, numerous arbitrations and individual lawsuits have been filed against the Corporation, Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates by parties who purchased ARS and are seeking relief that includes compensatory and punitive damages totaling in excess of
$1.2 billion
, as well as rescission, among other relief.
Securities Actions
The Corporation and Merrill Lynch face a number of civil actions relating to the sales of ARS and management of ARS auctions, including two putative class action lawsuits in which plaintiffs seek to recover the alleged losses in market value of ARS securities purportedly caused by defendants actions. Plaintiffs also seek unspecified damages, including rescission, other compensatory and consequential damages, costs, fees and interest. The first action,
In Re Merrill Lynch Auction Rate Securities Litigation
, is the result of the consolidation of two class action suits in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. These suits were brought by two Merrill Lynch customers on behalf of all persons who purchased ARS in auctions managed by Merrill Lynch, against Merrill Lynch and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (MLPF&S). On March 31, 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Merrill Lynchs motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs appealed and on November 14, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the district courts dismissal. Plaintiffs time to seek a writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court expired on February 13, 2012, and, as a result,
this action is now concluded. The second action,
Bondar v. Bank of America Corporation
, was brought by a putative class of ARS purchasers against the Corporation and Banc of America Securities, LLC (BAS). On February 24, 2011, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed the amended complaint and directed plaintiffs to state whether they will file a further amended complaint or appeal the courts dismissal. Following the Second Circuits decision in
In Re Merrill Lynch Auction Rate Securities Litigation
, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their action on January 4, 2012. The dismissal is subject to the district courts approval.
Antitrust Actions
The Corporation, Merrill Lynch and other financial institutions were also named in two putative antitrust class actions in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Plaintiffs in both actions assert federal antitrust claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Act based on allegations that defendants conspired to restrain trade in ARS by placing support bids in ARS auctions, only to collectively withdraw those bids in February 2008, which allegedly caused ARS auctions to fail. In the first action,
Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland v. Citigroup, Inc., et al.
, plaintiff seeks to represent a class of issuers of ARS that defendants underwrote between May 12, 2003 and February 13, 2008. This issuer action seeks to recover, among other relief, the alleged above-market interest payments that ARS issuers allegedly have had to make after defendants allegedly stopped placing support bids in ARS auctions. In the second action,
Mayfield, et al. v. Citigroup, Inc., et al.
, plaintiff seeks to represent a class of investors that purchased ARS from defendants and held those securities when ARS auctions failed on February 13, 2008. Plaintiff seeks to recover, among other relief, unspecified damages for losses in the ARS market value, and rescission of the investors ARS purchases. Both actions also seek treble damages and attorneys fees under the Sherman Acts private civil remedy. On January 25, 2010, the court dismissed both actions with prejudice and plaintiffs respective appeals are currently pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
Checking Account Overdraft Litigation
Bank of America, N.A. (BANA) is currently a defendant in several consumer suits challenging certain deposit account-related business practices. Four suits are part of a multi-district litigation proceeding (the MDL) involving approximately 65 individual cases against 30 financial institutions assigned by the Judicial Panel on Multi-district Litigation (JPML) to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The four cases:
Tornes v. Bank of America, N.A.; Yourke, et al. v. Bank of America, N.A., et al.
;
Knighten v. Bank of America, N.A.;
and
Phillips, et al. v. Bank of America, N.A.;
allege that BANA improperly and unfairly increased the number of overdraft fees it assessed on consumer deposit accounts by various means. The cases challenge the practice of reordering debit card transactions to post high-to-low and BANAs failure to notify customers at the point of sale that the transaction may result in an overdraft charge. The cases also allege that BANAs disclosures and advertising regarding the posting of debit card transactions are false, deceptive and misleading. These cases assert claims including breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, conversion, unjust enrichment and violation of the unfair and deceptive practices statutes of various states. Plaintiffs generally seek restitution of all overdraft fees paid to
 
BANA as a result of BANAs allegedly wrongful business practices, as well as disgorgement, punitive damages, injunctive relief, pre-judgment interest and attorneys fees. Omnibus motions to dismiss many of the complaints involved in the MDL, including
Tornes, Yourke
and
Knighten
, were denied on March 12, 2010.
Knighten
was dismissed without prejudice on February 4, 2011. On November 22, 2011, the MDL court granted final approval of a settlement of all the remaining class matters in the MDL (including
Tornes, Yourke and Phillips
), providing for a payment by the Corporation of
$410 million
(which amount was fully accrued by the Corporation, as of
December 31, 2011
) in exchange for a complete release of claims asserted against the Corporation in the MDL. Several MDL settlement class members have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit from the judgment granting final approval to the settlement.
Countrywide Bond Insurance Litigation
The Corporation, Countrywide Financial Corporation (CFC) and other Countrywide entities are subject to claims from several monoline bond insurance companies. These claims generally relate to bond insurance policies provided by the insurers on securitized pools of home equity lines of credit (HELOC) and fixed-rate second-lien mortgage loans. Plaintiffs in these cases generally allege that they have paid claims as a result of defaults in the underlying loans and assert that these defaults are the result of improper underwriting by defendants.
Ambac
The Corporation, CFC and other Countrywide entities are named as defendants in an action filed by Ambac Assurance Corporation (Ambac) entitled
Ambac Assurance Corporation and The Segregated Account of Ambac Assurance Corporation v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., et al.
This action, currently pending in New York Supreme Court, New York County, relates to bond insurance policies provided by Ambac on certain securitized pools of HELOC and fixed-rate second-lien mortgage loans. On September 8, 2011, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which asserts claims involving five additional securitizations of first- and second-lien mortgage loans and alleges fraudulent inducement, breach of contract as well as other claims set forth in the initial complaint. The amended complaint also reasserts a claim that the Corporation is jointly and severally liable as the successor to Countrywide. The amended complaint seeks unspecified actual and punitive damages and equitable relief.
FGIC
The Corporation, CFC and other Countrywide entities are named as defendants in an action filed by Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC) entitled
Financial Guaranty Insurance Co. v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc
. This action, currently pending in New York Supreme Court, New York County, relates to bond insurance policies provided by FGIC on securitized pools of HELOC and fixed-rate second-lien mortgage loans. In June 2010, the court entered an order that granted in part and denied in part the Countrywide defendants motion to dismiss. On April 30, 2010, FGIC filed an amended complaint reasserting claims set forth in the initial complaint and asserting a claim that the Corporation is jointly and severally liable as the successor to Countrywide. In October 2011, following the appellate courts June 30, 2011 order on the cross-appeals in
MBIA Insurance Corporation, Inc. v. Countrywide Home Loans, et al.
, the parties entered a joint stipulated order
withdrawing cross-appeals from the courts June 2010 order.
On March 24, 2010, CFC and other Countrywide entities filed a separate but related action against FGIC in New York Supreme Court seeking monetary damages of at least
$100 million
against FGIC in connection with FGICs failure to pay claims under certain bond insurance policies. The same day, CFC and the other Countrywide entities filed an action to enjoin the instruction of the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) to FGIC to suspend payments claimed under various insurance agreements or its approval of FGICs plan to do so. This action is currently being voluntarily deferred at the request of the NYSDFS.
MBIA
The Corporation, CFC and other Countrywide entities are named as defendants in two actions filed by MBIA Insurance Corporation (MBIA). The first action,
MBIA Insurance Corporation, Inc. v. Countrywide Home Loans, et al.
, is pending in New York Supreme Court, New York County. In April 2010, the court granted in part and denied in part the Countrywide defendants motion to dismiss and denied the Corporations motion to dismiss. The parties filed cross-appeals. On December 22, 2010, the court issued an order on MBIAs motion for use of sampling at trial, in which the court held that MBIA may attempt to prove its breach of contract and fraudulent inducement claims through examination of statistically significant samples of the securitizations at issue. In its order, the court did not endorse any of MBIAs specific sampling proposals and stated that defendants have significant valid challenges to MBIAs methodology that they may present at trial, together with defendants own views and evidence. On June 30, 2011, the appellate court issued a decision on the parties cross-appeals. The appellate court dismissed MBIAs breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim, which reversed the trial court ruling on that claim, and otherwise affirmed the trial courts decisions.
On May 25, 2011, MBIA moved for partial summary judgment, seeking rulings that: (i) MBIA does not have to show that Countrywides alleged fraud and breaches of contract proximately caused MBIAs losses; and (ii) the term materially and adversely affects in the transaction documents does not limit the repurchase remedy to defaulted loans, or require MBIA to show that Countrywides breaches of the representations and warranties caused the loans to default. On January 3, 2012, the court issued an order that granted in part and denied in part MBIAs motion. The court ruled that under New York insurance law, MBIA does not need to prove a causal link between Countrywides alleged misrepresentations and the payments made pursuant to the policies. The court also held that plaintiff could recover rescissory damages (the amounts it has been required to pay pursuant to the policies less premiums received) on such claims, but must prove that it was damaged as a direct result of Countrywides alleged material misrepresentations. The court denied the motion in its entirety on the issue of the interpretation of the materially and adversely affects language. On January 25, 2012, Countrywide appealed the courts decision and order to the extent it granted MBIAs motion. On February 6, 2012, MBIA filed a cross-appeal of the courts decision and order to the extent it denied MBIAs motion.
The second MBIA action,
MBIA Insurance Corporation, Inc. v. Bank of America Corporation, Countrywide Financial Corporation, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., Countrywide Securities Corporation,
 
et al.
, is pending in California Superior Court, Los Angeles County. MBIA purports to bring this action as subrogee to the note holders for certain securitized pools of HELOC and fixed-rate second-lien mortgage loans and seeks unspecified damages and declaratory relief. On May 17, 2010, the court dismissed the claims against the Countrywide defendants with leave to amend, but denied the request to dismiss MBIAs successor liability claims against the Corporation. On June 21, 2010, MBIA filed an amended complaint re-asserting its previously dismissed claims against the Countrywide defendants, re-asserting the successor liability claim against the Corporation and adding Countrywide Capital Markets, LLC as a defendant. The Countrywide defendants filed a demurrer to the amended complaint, but the court declined to rule on the demurrer and instead entered an order staying the case until August 2011. On August 18, 2011, the court ordered a partial lifting of the stay to permit certain limited discovery to proceed. The stay otherwise remains in effect.
Syncora
The Corporation, CFC and other Countrywide entities are named as defendants in an action filed by Syncora Guarantee Inc. (Syncora) entitled
Syncora Guarantee Inc. v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., et al.
This action, currently pending in New York Supreme Court, New York County, relates to bond insurance policies provided by Syncora on certain securitized pools of HELOC. In March 2010, the court issued an order that granted in part and denied in part the Countrywide defendants motion to dismiss. Syncora and the Countrywide defendants filed cross-appeals from this order. In May 2010, Syncora amended its complaint. Defendants filed an answer to Syncoras amended complaint on July 9, 2010, as well as a counterclaim for breach of contract and declaratory judgment. The parties subsequently stipulated to the dismissal of defendants counterclaim without prejudice. Following the appellate courts June 30, 2011 order on the cross-appeals in
MBIA Insurance Corporation, Inc. v. Countrywide Home Loans, et al.
, the parties entered a joint stipulated order withdrawing their cross-appeals.
On August 16, 2011, Syncora moved for partial summary judgment, seeking rulings that: (i) Syncora does not have to show that Countrywides alleged fraud and breaches of contract proximately caused Syncoras losses; and (ii) the term materially and adversely affects in the transaction documents does not limit the repurchase remedy to defaulted loans, or require Syncora to show that Countrywides breaches of the representations and warranties caused the loans to default. On January 3, 2012, the court issued a decision and order that granted in part and denied in part Syncoras motion. The court ruled that under New York insurance law, Syncora does not need to prove a causal link between Countrywides alleged misrepresentations and the payments made pursuant to the policies. The Court also held plaintiff could recover rescissory damages (the amounts it has been required to pay pursuant to the polices less premiums received) on such claims, but must prove that it was damaged as a direct result of Countrywides alleged material misrepresentations. The court denied the motion in its entirety on the issue of the interpretation of the materially and adversely affects language. On January 6, 2012, Syncora appealed the decision and order to the extent it denied Syncoras motion. On January 25, 2012, Countrywide filed a cross-appeal of the courts decision and order to the extent it granted Syncoras motion.
Fair Lending Investigation
On December 21, 2011, CFC, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (CHL), and Countrywide Bank (which was merged into BANA effective July 1, 2011) entered into a consent order to resolve an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) into legacy lending practices of Countrywide. The investigation concerned alleged discriminatory lending practices by Countrywide in the extension of residential credit and in residential real estate-related transactions. The investigation and resulting consent order did not relate to the current lending practices of the Corporation or of its affiliates. The consent order does not require any injunctive provisions against the Corporation or BANA concerning its lending practices. The consent order requires the establishment of a restitution fund of
$335 million
to be paid to allegedly aggrieved borrowers. This amount was fully accrued by the Corporation as of
December 31, 2011
. The consent order was entered by the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on December 28, 2011.
Fontainebleau Las Vegas Litigation
On June 9, 2009, Fontainebleau Las Vegas, LLC (FBLV), then a Chapter 11 debtor-in-possession, commenced an adversary proceeding, entitled
Fontainebleau Las Vegas, LLC v. Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation, et al
. (FBLV action), against a group of lenders, including BANA and Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation (MLCC). The action was originally filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of Florida, but is now before the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. On April 12, 2010, FBLVs Chapter 11 case was converted to a Chapter 7 case and a trustee was appointed (the Bankruptcy Trustee). The complaint alleges, among other things, that defendants breached an agreement to lend their respective committed amounts under an
$800 million
revolving loan facility, of which BANA and MLCC had each committed
$100 million
, in connection with the construction of a resort and casino development. The complaint seeks damages in excess of
$3 billion
and a turnover order under Section 542 of the Bankruptcy Code requiring the lenders to fund their respective commitments. On September 21, 2010, the court dismissed the breach of contract and turnover claims to allow the Bankruptcy Trustee, as plaintiff, to pursue an immediate appeal of the courts August 2009 decision denying partial summary judgment of certain of FBLVs claims. The Bankruptcy Trustee filed a notice of appeal on October 18, 2010 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.
On June 9, 2009, a related lawsuit,
Avenue CLO Fund Ltd., et al. v. Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation, et al
. (the Avenue action), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada by certain project lenders. On September 21, 2009, another related lawsuit,
ACP Master, Ltd., et al. v. Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation, et al
. (the ACP action), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by the purported successors-in-interest to certain project lenders. These two actions were subsequently transferred by the JPML to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida for coordinated pretrial proceedings with the FBLV action. Plaintiffs in the Avenue and ACP actions (the Term Lenders) repeat FBLVs allegations that BANA, MLCC and the other defendants breached their revolving loan facility commitments to FBLV. In addition, they allege that BANA breached its duties as disbursement agent under a separate agreement governing the disbursement of loaned funds to FBLV. The Term Lenders seek unspecified money damages on their claims. On May 28, 2010,
 
the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss the revolving loan facility commitment claims, but denied BANAs motion to dismiss the disbursement agent claims. On January 13, 2011, the district court granted the Term Lenders motion for entry of a partial final judgment on their revolving loan facility commitment claims. The Term Lenders filed a notice of appeal with respect to those claims on January 19, 2011.
On April 19, 2011, the district court dismissed the disbursement agent claims against BANA in the ACP action after the Avenue action plaintiffs represented that they had acquired the claims belonging to the ACP action plaintiffs and would be pursuing those claims in the Avenue action. On September 27, 2011, the Avenue action parties submitted their respective motions for summary judgment on the disbursement agent claims.
In re Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation
BAS, Merrill Lynch & Co., MLPF&S, and certain of their subsidiaries, along with other underwriters, and various issuers and others, were named as defendants in a number of putative class action lawsuits that have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York as
In re Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation.
Plaintiffs contend, among other things, that defendants failed to make certain required disclosures in the registration statements and prospectuses for applicable offerings regarding alleged agreements with institutional investors that tied allocations in certain offerings to the purchase orders by those investors in the aftermarket. Plaintiffs allege that such agreements allowed defendants to manipulate the price of the securities sold in these offerings in violation of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and SEC rules promulgated thereunder. The parties agreed to settle the matter, for which the court granted final approval. Certain putative class members filed an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit seeking reversal of the final approval. On August 25, 2011, the district court, on remand from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, dismissed the objection by the last remaining putative class member, concluding that he was not a class member. On January 9, 2012, that objector dismissed with prejudice an appeal of the courts dismissal pursuant to a settlement agreement. On November 28, 2011, an objector whose appeals were dismissed by the Second Circuit filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court that was rejected as procedurally defective. On January 17, 2012, the Supreme Court advised the objector that the petition was untimely and should not be resubmitted to the Supreme Court.
Interchange and Related Litigation
A group of merchants have filed a series of putative class actions and individual actions with regard to interchange fees associated with Visa and MasterCard payment card transactions. These actions, which have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York under the caption
In Re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Anti-Trust Litigation
(
Interchange
), name Visa, MasterCard and several banks and bank holding companies, including the Corporation, as defendants. Plaintiffs allege that defendants conspired to fix the level of default interchange rates, which represent the fee an issuing bank charges an acquiring bank on every transaction. Plaintiffs also challenge as unreasonable restraints of trade under Section 1 of the Sherman Act certain rules of Visa and MasterCard related to merchant acceptance of payment cards at the point of sale.
Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief based on their assertion that interchange would be lower or eliminated absent the alleged conduct. On January 8, 2008, the court granted defendants motion to dismiss all claims for pre-2004 damages. Motions to dismiss the remainder of the complaint and plaintiffs motion for class certification are pending. In February 2011, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment.
In addition, plaintiffs filed supplemental complaints against certain defendants, including the Corporation, relating to initial public offerings (the IPOs) of MasterCard and Visa. Plaintiffs allege that the IPOs violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act and Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Plaintiffs also assert that the MasterCard IPO was a fraudulent conveyance. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and to undo the IPOs. Motions to dismiss both supplemental complaints, as well as summary judgment motions challenging both supplemental complaints, remain pending.
The Corporation and certain affiliates have entered into loss-sharing agreements with Visa, Mastercard and other financial institutions in connection with certain antitrust litigation, including
Interchange
. Collectively, the loss-sharing agreements require the Corporation and/or certain affiliates to pay
11.6 percent
of the monetary portion of any comprehensive
Interchange
settlement. In the event of an adverse judgment, the agreements require the Corporation and/or certain affiliates to pay
12.8 percent
of any damages associated with Visa-related claims (Visa-related damages),
9.1 percent
of any damages associated with MasterCard-related claims, and
11.6 percent
of any damages associated with internetwork claims (internetwork damages) or not associated specifically with Visa or MasterCard-related claims (unassigned damages).
Pursuant to Visas publicly-disclosed Retrospective Responsibility Plan (the RRP), Visa placed certain proceeds from its IPO into an escrow fund (the Escrow). Under the RRP, funds in the Escrow may be accessed by Visa and its members, including Bank of America, to pay monetary damages in
Interchange
, with the Corporations payments from the Escrow capped at
12.81 percent
of the funds that Visa places therein. Subject to that cap, the Corporation may use Escrow funds to cover
73.9 percent
of its monetary payment towards a comprehensive
Interchange
settlement,
100 percent
of its payment for any Visa-related damages and
73.9 percent
of its payment for any internetwork and unassigned damages.
Two actions,
Watson v. Bank of America Corp.
, filed on March 28, 2011 in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Canada, and
Bancroft-Snell v. Visa Canada Corp.
, filed on May 16, 2011 in Ontario Superior Court, were filed by purported nationwide classes of merchants that accept Visa and/or MasterCard credit cards in Canada. The actions name as defendants Visa, MasterCard, and a number of other banks and bank holding companies, including the Corporation. Plaintiffs allege that defendants conspired to fix the merchant discount fees that merchants pay to acquiring banks on credit card transactions. Plaintiffs also allege that defendants conspired to impose certain rules relating to merchant acceptance of credit cards at the point of sale. The actions assert claims under section 45 of the Competition Act and other common law claims, and seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief based on their assertion that merchant discount fees would be lower absent the challenged conduct. These actions are not covered by the RRP or loss-sharing agreements previously entered into in connection with certain antitrust litigation, including
Interchange
.
 
Merrill Lynch Acquisition-related Matters
Since January 2009, the Corporation and certain of its current and former officers and directors, among others, have been named as defendants in a variety of actions filed in state and federal courts relating to the Corporations acquisition of Merrill Lynch (the Acquisition). These Acquisition-related cases consist of securities actions, derivative actions and actions under ERISA. The claims in these actions generally concern: (i) the Acquisition; (ii) the financial condition and 2008 fourth-quarter losses experienced by the Corporation and Merrill Lynch; (iii) due diligence conducted in connection with the Acquisition; (iv) the Acquisition agreements terms regarding Merrill Lynchs ability to pay bonuses to Merrill Lynch employees up to
$5.8 billion
; (v) the Corporations discussions with government officials in December 2008 regarding the Corporations consideration of invoking the material adverse change clause in the Acquisition agreement and the possibility of obtaining government assistance in completing the Acquisition; and/or (vi) alleged material misrepresentations and/or material omissions in the proxy statement and related materials for the Acquisition.
Securities Actions
Plaintiffs in
In re Bank of America Securities, Derivative and Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) Litigation
(Securities Plaintiffs), a putative class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, represent all: (i) purchasers of the Corporations common and preferred securities between September 15, 2008 and January 21, 2009 and its January 2011 options; (ii) holders of the Corporations common stock as of October 10, 2008; and (iii) purchasers of the Corporations common stock issued in the offering that occurred on or about October 7, 2008. During the purported class period, the Corporation had between
4,560,112,687
and
5,017,579,321
common shares outstanding and the price of those shares declined from
$33.74
on September 12, 2008 to
$6.68
on January 21, 2009. Securities Plaintiffs claim violations of Sections 10(b), 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and SEC rules promulgated thereunder. Securities Plaintiffs amended complaint also alleges violations of Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 related to the offering of the Corporations common stock that occurred on or about October 7, 2008, and names BAS and MLPF&S, among others, as defendants on certain claims. The Corporation and its co-defendants filed motions to dismiss, which the court granted in part in August 2010 by dismissing certain of the Securities Plaintiffs claims under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Securities Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint which repleaded some of the dismissed claims as well as added claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of holders of certain debt, preferred securities and option securities. In July 2011, the court granted in part defendants motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. As a result of the courts July 2011 ruling, the Securities Plaintiffs were (in addition to the claims sustained in the courts August 2010 ruling) permitted to pursue a claim under Section 10(b) asserting that defendants should have made additional disclosures in connection with the Acquisition about the financial condition and 2008 fourth-quarter losses experienced by Merrill Lynch. Securities Plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages, legal costs and attorneys fees. On February 6, 2012, the court granted Securities Plaintiffs
motion for class certification. On February 21, 2012, the Corporation filed a petition requesting that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit review the district courts order granting Securities Plaintiffs motion for class certification.
Several individual plaintiffs have opted to pursue claims apart from the
In re Bank of America Securities, Derivative, and Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) Litigation
and, accordingly, have initiated individual actions in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York relying on substantially the same facts and claims as the Securities Plaintiffs.
On January 13, 2010, the Corporation, Merrill Lynch and certain of the Corporations current and former officers and directors were named in a purported class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entitled
Dornfest v. Bank of America Corp., et al
. The action is purportedly brought on behalf of investors in Corporation option contracts between September 15, 2008 and January 22, 2009 and alleges that during the class period approximately
9.5 million
Corporation call option contracts and approximately
eight million
Corporation put option contracts were traded on seven of the Options Clearing Corporation exchanges. The complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC rules promulgated thereunder. Plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages, legal costs and attorneys fees. On April 9, 2010, the court consolidated this action with the consolidated securities action in the
In re Bank of America Securities, Derivative and Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) Litigation
, and ruled that plaintiffs may pursue the action as an individual action. In August 2011, plaintiff again asked the court for permission to pursue claims on a class basis, which the court again denied in an order issued in September 2011. Plaintiffs have attempted to appeal that ruling.
Derivative Actions
The Corporation and certain current and former directors are named as defendants in several putative class and derivative actions in the Delaware Court of Chancery, including:
Rothbaum v. Lewis
;
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority v. Lewis; Tremont Partners LLC v. Lewis; Kovacs v. Lewis; Stern v. Lewis
; and
Houx v. Lewis
, brought by shareholders alleging breaches of fiduciary duties and waste of corporate assets in connection with the Acquisition. On April 27, 2009, the Delaware Court of Chancery consolidated the derivative actions under the caption
In re Bank of America Corporation Stockholder Derivative Litigation
. The consolidated derivative complaint seeks, among other things, unspecified monetary damages, equitable remedies and other relief. On April 30, 2009, the putative class claims in the
Stern v. Lewis
and
Houx v. Lewis
actions were voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. Trial is scheduled for October 2012.
In addition, the JPML ordered the transfer of actions related to the Acquisition that had been pending in various federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. These actions have been separately consolidated and are now pending under the caption
In re Bank of America Securities, Derivative and Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) Litigation.
On October 9, 2009, plaintiffs in the derivative actions in the
In re Bank of America Securities, Derivative and Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) Litigation
(the Derivative Plaintiffs) filed a consolidated amended derivative and class action complaint. The amended complaint names as defendants certain
 
of the Corporations current and former directors, officers and financial advisors, and certain of Merrill Lynchs current and former directors and officers. The Corporation is named as a nominal defendant with respect to the derivative claims. The amended complaint asserts claims for, among other things: (i) violation of federal securities laws; (ii) breach of fiduciary duties; (iii) the return of incentive compensation that is alleged to be inappropriate in view of the work performed and the results achieved by certain of the defendants; and (iv) contribution in connection with the Corporations exposure to significant liability under state and federal law. The amended complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, equitable remedies and other relief. On February 8, 2010, the Derivative Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against each of the former Merrill Lynch officers and directors without prejudice. The Corporation and its co-defendants filed motions to dismiss, which were granted in part on August 27, 2010. On October 18, 2010, the Corporation and its co-defendants answered the remaining allegations asserted by the Derivative Plaintiffs.
ERISA Actions
On October 9, 2009, plaintiffs in the ERISA actions in the
In re Bank of America Securities, Derivative and Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) Litigation
(the ERISA Plaintiffs) filed a consolidated amended complaint for breaches of duty under ERISA. The amended complaint is brought on behalf of a purported class that consists of participants in the Corporations 401(k) Plan, the Corporations 401(k) Plan for Legacy Companies, the CFC 401(k) Plan (collectively, the 401(k) Plans) and the Corporations Pension Plan. The amended complaint alleges violations of ERISA, based on, among other things: (i) an alleged failure to prudently and loyally manage the 401(k) Plans and Pension Plan by continuing to offer the Corporations common stock as an investment option or measure for participant contributions; (ii) an alleged failure to monitor the fiduciaries of the 401(k) Plans and Pension Plan; (iii) an alleged failure to provide complete and accurate information to the 401(k) Plans and Pension Plan participants with respect to the Merrill Lynch and Countrywide acquisitions and related matters; and (iv) alleged co-fiduciary liability for these purported fiduciary breaches. The amended complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, equitable remedies and other relief. On August 27, 2010, the court dismissed the complaint brought by plaintiffs in the consolidated ERISA action in its entirety. The ERISA Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the courts dismissal of their actions. The parties then stipulated to the dismissal of the appeal with the agreement that the ERISA Plaintiffs can reinstate their appeal at any time up until July 27, 2012.
NYAG Action
On February 4, 2010, the New York Attorney General (NYAG) filed a civil complaint in New York Supreme Court entitled
People of the State of New York v. Bank of America, et al
. The complaint names as defendants the Corporation and the Corporations former CEO and CFO, and alleges violations of Sections 352, 352-c(1)(a), 352-c(1)(c) and 353 of the New York General Business Law, commonly known as the Martin Act, and Section 63(12) of the New York Executive Law. The complaint seeks an unspecified amount in disgorgement, penalties, restitution, and damages and other equitable relief.
Montgomery
The Corporation, several current and former officers and directors, BAS, MLPF&S and other unaffiliated underwriters have been named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entitled
Montgomery v. Bank of America, et al
. Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on January 14, 2011. Plaintiff seeks to sue on behalf of all persons who acquired certain series of preferred stock offered by the Corporation pursuant to a shelf registration statement dated May 5, 2006. Plaintiffs claims arise from three offerings dated January 24, 2008, January 28, 2008 and May 20, 2008, from which the Corporation allegedly received proceeds of
$15.8 billion
. The amended complaint asserts claims under Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, and alleges that the prospectus supplements associated with the offerings: (i) failed to disclose that the Corporations loans, leases, CDOs and commercial MBS were impaired to a greater extent than disclosed; (ii) misrepresented the extent of the impaired assets by failing to establish adequate reserves or properly record losses for its impaired assets; (iii) misrepresented the adequacy of the Corporations internal controls in light of the alleged impairment of its assets; (iv) misrepresented the Corporations capital base and Tier 1 leverage ratio for risk-based capital in light of the allegedly impaired assets; and (v) misrepresented the thoroughness and adequacy of the Corporations due diligence in connection with its acquisition of Countrywide. The amended complaint seeks rescission, compensatory and other damages. Defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim. On February 9, 2012, the magistrate judge (to whom dispositive motions were referred for a report and recommendation) concluded that the amended complaint does not adequately plead claims under the Securities Act of 1933 and recommended that the district court dismiss the amended complaint in its entirety and deny plaintiffs request to amend the complaint without prejudice, which the district court will consider.
Mortgage-backed Securities Litigation
The Corporation and its affiliates, Countrywide entities and their affiliates, and Merrill Lynch entities and their affiliates have been named as defendants in a number of cases relating to their various roles as issuer, originator, seller, depositor, sponsor, underwriter and/or controlling entity in MBS offerings, pursuant to which the MBS investors were entitled to a portion of the cash flow from the underlying pools of mortgages. These cases generally include purported class action suits and actions by individual MBS purchasers. Although the allegations vary by lawsuit, these cases generally allege that the registration statements, prospectuses and prospectus supplements for securities issued by securitization trusts contained material misrepresentations and omissions, in violation of Sections 11, 12 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and/or state securities laws and other state statutory and common laws.
These cases generally involve allegations of false and misleading statements regarding: (i) the process by which the properties that served as collateral for the mortgage loans underlying the MBS were appraised; (ii) the percentage of equity that mortgage borrowers had in their homes; (iii) the borrowers ability to repay their mortgage loans; (iv) the underwriting practices by which those mortgage loans were originated; (v) the ratings
 
given to the different tranches of MBS by rating agencies; and (vi) the validity of each issuing trusts title to the mortgage loans comprising the pool for that securitization (collectively, MBS Claims). Plaintiffs in these cases generally seek unspecified compensatory damages, unspecified costs and legal fees and, in some instances, seek rescission. A number of other entities (including the National Credit Union Administration) have threatened legal actions against the Corporation and its affiliates, Countrywide entities and their affiliates, and Merrill Lynch entities and their affiliates concerning MBS offerings.
On August 15, 2011, the JPML ordered multiple federal court cases involving Countrywide MBS consolidated for pretrial purposes in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, in a multi-district litigation entitled
In re Countrywide Financial Corp. Mortgage-Backed Securities Litigation
(the Countrywide RMBS MDL).
AIG Litigation
On August 8, 2011, American International Group, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, AIG) filed a complaint in New York Supreme Court, New York County, in a case entitled
American International Group, Inc. et al. v. Bank of America Corporation et al.
AIG has named the Corporation, Merrill Lynch, CHL and a number of related entities as defendants. AIGs complaint asserts certain MBS Claims pertaining to
347
MBS offerings and two private placements in which it alleges that it purchased securities between 2005 and 2007. AIG seeks rescission of its purchases or a rescissory measure of damages or, in the alternative, compensatory damages of no less than
$10 billion
; punitive damages; and other unspecified relief. Defendants removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and filed a notice with the JMDL seeking to add the case to the Countrywide RMBS MDL. The district court denied AIGs motion to remand the case to state court. Plaintiffs are seeking an interlocutory appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit following the district courts certification. On December 21, 2011, the JMDL transferred the Countrywide MBS claims to the Countrywide RMBS MDL. The non-Countrywide MBS claims will be heard in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.
Dexia Litigation
Dexia Holdings, Inc. and others filed an action on January 24, 2011 against CFC, the Corporation, several related entities, and former directors and officers of Countrywide in New York Supreme Court, New York County entitled
Dexia Holdings, Inc., et al., v. Countrywide Financial Corporation, et al.
The complaint asserts certain MBS Claims relating to plaintiffs alleged purchases of MBS issued by CFC-related entities in 142 MBS offerings and six private placements between April 2004 and August 2007 and seeks unspecified compensatory and/or rescissory damages, punitive damages and other unspecified relief. Defendants removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, and on August 15, 2011, the JMDL transferred the case to the Countrywide RMBS MDL. On November 8, 2011, the Countrywide RMBS MDL denied plaintiffs motion to remand the case to New York Supreme Court. On February 17, 2012, the Countrywide RMBS MDL granted in substantial part defendants' motion to dismiss, dismissing with prejudice all federal law claims
as to 146 of the 148 offerings at issue, dismissing with leave to amend the state law negligent misrepresentation, aiding and abetting, and successor liability claims and substantially denying the motion to dismiss as to the state law fraud and fraudulent inducement claims.
FHFA Litigation
The FHFA, as conservator for FNMA and FHLMC, filed an action on September 2, 2011 against the Corporation and related entities, CFC and related entities, certain former officers of these entities, and NB Holdings Corporation in New York Supreme Court, New York County, entitled
Federal Housing Finance Agency v. Countrywide Financial Corporation, et al.
(the FHFA Countrywide Litigation). FHFAs complaint asserts certain MBS Claims in connection with allegations that FNMA and FHLMC purchased MBS issued by CFC-related entities in 86 MBS offerings between 2005 and 2008. The FHFA seeks among other relief, rescission of the consideration paid for the securities or alternatively damages allegedly incurred by FNMA and FHLMC. The FHFA also seeks recovery of punitive damages.
On September 30, 2011, CFC removed the FHFA Countrywide Litigation from New York Supreme Court to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. On February 7, 2012, the JPML transferred the matter to the Countrywide RMBS MDL. The FHFAs motion to remand the case to New York Supreme Court is pending.
Also on September 2, 2011, the FHFA, as conservator for FNMA and FHLMC, filed complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Corporation and Merrill Lynch related entities, and certain current and former officers and directors of these entities.

On January 18, 2011, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (FHLB Atlanta) filed a complaint asserting certain MBS Claims against the Corporation, CFC and other Countrywide entities in Georgia State Court, Fulton County, entitled
Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta v. Countrywide Financial Corporation, et al
. FHLB Atlanta seeks rescission of its purchases or a rescissory measure of damages, unspecified punitive damages and other unspecified relief in connection with its alleged purchase of 16 MBS offerings issued and/or underwritten by Countrywide-related entities between 2004 and 2007.

Luther Litigation and Related Actions
On November 14, 2007, David H. Luther and various pension funds (collectively, the Luther Plaintiffs) commenced a putative class action against CFC, several of its affiliates, MLPF&S and certain former officers of these in California Superior Court, Los Angeles County, entitled
Luther v. Countrywide Financial Corporation, et al.
(the Luther Action). The Luther Plaintiffs complaint asserts certain MBS Claims in connection with MBS issued by subsidiaries of CFC in 429 offerings between 2005 and 2007. The Luther Plaintiffs certified that they collectively purchased securities in 63 of 429 offerings for approximately
$216 million
. The Luther Plaintiffs seek compensatory and/or rescissory damages and other unspecified relief. On January 6, 2010, the court granted CFCs motion to dismiss with prejudice due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On May 18, 2011, the California Court of Appeal reversed the dismissal and remanded to the Superior Court. Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss.
Following the previous dismissal of the Luther Action on January 6, 2010, the Maine State Retirement System filed a putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, entitled
Maine State Retirement System v. Countrywide Financial Corporation, et al.
(the Maine Action). The Maine Action names the same defendants as the Luther Action, as well as the Corporation and NB Holdings Corporation, and asserts substantially the same allegations regarding 427 of the MBS offerings that were at issue in the Luther Action. Plaintiffs in the Maine Action (Maine Plaintiffs) seek compensatory and/or rescissory damages and other unspecified relief.
On November 4, 2010, the court granted CFCs motion to dismiss the amended complaint in its entirety and held that the Maine Plaintiffs only have standing to sue over the 81 offerings in which they actually purchased MBS. The court also held that the applicable statute of limitations could be tolled by the filing of the Luther Action only with respect to the offerings in which the Luther Plaintiffs actually purchased MBS. As a result of these standing and tolling rulings, the number of offerings at issue in the Maine Action was reduced from 427 to 14. On December 6, 2010, the Maine Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint that relates to 14 MBS offerings. On April 21, 2011, the court dismissed with prejudice the successor liability claims against the Corporation and NB Holdings Corporation.
On May 6, 2011, the court held that the Maine Plaintiffs only have standing to sue over the specific MBS tranches that they purchased, and that the applicable statute of limitations could be tolled by the filing of the Luther Action only
with respect to the specific tranches of MBS that the Luther Plaintiffs purchased. As a result of these tranche-specific standing and tolling rulings, the Maine Action was further reduced from 14 offerings to eight tranches. On June 6, 2011, the Maine Plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint that related to eight MBS tranches. On June 15, 2011, the court denied the Maine Plaintiffs motion to permit immediate interlocutory appeal of the courts orders on standing, tolling of the statute of limitations and successor liability. On October 12, 2011, upon stipulation by the parties, the court certified a class consisting of eight subclasses, one for each of the eight MBS tranches at issue.
On November 17, 2010, Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Trust Fund (Western Teamsters) filed a putative class action against the same defendants named in the Maine Action in California Superior Court, Los Angeles County, entitled
Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Trust Fund v. Countrywide Financial Corporation, et al
. Western Teamsters complaint asserts that Western Teamsters and other unspecified investors purchased MBS issued in the 428 offerings that were also at issue in the Luther Action and asserts substantially the same allegations as the Luther Action. The Western Teamsters action has been coordinated with the Luther Action. Western Teamsters seek unspecified compensatory and/or rescissory damages and other unspecified relief.
On January 27, 2011, Putnam Bank filed a putative class action lawsuit against CFC, the Corporation and several related entities, among others, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, entitled
Putnam Bank v. Countrywide Financial Corporation, et al
. Putnam Banks complaint asserts certain MBS Claims in connection with alleged purchases in eight MBS offerings issued by CFC subsidiaries between 2005 and 2007. Putnam Bank seeks rescission of its purchases or a rescissory measure of unspecified damages and/or compensatory damages and other unspecified relief. On August 15, 2011, the case was transferred to the Countrywide RMBS MDL.
Sealink Litigation

Sealink Funding Limited v. Countrywide Financial Corp.
, and was filed in New York Supreme Court, New York County. The complaint asserts certain MBS Claims in connection with alleged purchases in 31 MBS offerings issued and/or underwritten by Countrywide entities between 2005 and 2007. Sealink seeks among other relief, rescission of the consideration Sealink allegedly paid for the securities, or alternatively, damages allegedly incurred by Sealink, as well as punitive damages. On October 6, 2011, defendants removed the action to the U.S District Court for the Southern District of New York. The JMDL transferred the case to the Countrywide RMBS MDL.
Merrill Lynch MBS Litigation
Merrill Lynch, MLPF&S, MLMI, and certain current and former directors of MLMI are named as defendants in a consolidated class action in the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York, entitled
Public Employees
Ret. System of Mississippi v. Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc
. Plaintiffs assert certain MBS Claims in connection with their purchase of MBS. In March 2010, the court dismissed claims related to 65 of 84 offerings with prejudice due
 
to lack of standing as no named plaintiff purchased securities in those offerings. On November 8, 2010, the court dismissed claims related to one additional offering on separate grounds. On December 14, 2011, the court granted preliminary approval of a settlement providing for a payment by the Corporation in an amount not material to the Corporations results of operations (which amount was fully accrued by the Corporation as of December 31, 2011).
Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP (Merrill Lynch) Litigation
On August 19, 2010, Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP (ABP) filed a complaint against Merrill Lynch related entities, and certain current and former directors of MLMI and other defendants, in New York Supreme Court, New York County, entitled
Stichting Pensioenfonds v. Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., et al
. The action was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. ABPs complaint asserts certain MBS Claims in connection with alleged purchases in 13 offerings of Merrill Lynch-related MBS issued between 2006 and 2007. On October 12, 2011, ABP filed an amended complaint regarding the same offerings and adding additional federal securities law and state law claims. ABP seeks unspecified compensatory damages, interest and legal fees, or alternatively, rescission.
Regulatory Investigations
The Corporation has received a number of subpoenas and other requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities regarding MBS and other mortgage-related matters, including inquiries and investigations related to a number of transactions involving the Corporations underwriting and issuance of MBS and its participation in certain CDO offerings. These inquiries and investigations include, among others, an investigation by the SEC related to Merrill Lynchs risk control, valuation, structuring, marketing and purchase of CDOs. The Corporation has provided documents and testimony and continues to cooperate fully with these inquiries and investigations.
Countrywide may also be subject to contractual indemnification for the benefit of certain individuals involved in the MBS matters discussed above.
Mortgage Repurchase Litigation
Walnut Place Litigation
On February 23, 2011, 11 entities with the common name Walnut Place (including Walnut Place LLC, and Walnut Place II LLC through Walnut Place XI LLC) filed a lawsuit, entitled
Walnut Place LLC, et al. v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. et al.,
in New York Supreme Court, New York County, against CHL and several unaffiliated defendants (collectively, Sellers), as well as the Corporation and the Bank of New York Mellon in its capacity as trustee. The initial complaint was a purported derivative action for alleged breaches of a pooling and servicing agreement under which the Sellers sold residential mortgage loans to a securitization trust. Plaintiffs are alleged holders of certificates in several classes of the securitization trust who purport to sue derivatively in the place of the trustee. Plaintiffs allege that Sellers breached representations and warranties in the pooling and servicing agreement regarding mortgage loans. Plaintiffs seek a court order requiring Sellers to repurchase the mortgage loans at issue, or alternatively, damages for breach of contract, and allege that the Corporation is a successor in liability to CHL. On April 12, 2011, plaintiffs amended
their complaint to add similar allegations with respect to an additional securitization trust. On May 17, 2011, the Corporation and Sellers jointly moved to dismiss the amended complaint.
On August 2, 2011, plaintiffs filed a separate action entitled
Walnut Place LLC, et al. v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. et al
., in New York Supreme Court, New York County, against the Corporation and Sellers, and The Bank of New York Mellon in its capacity as trustee. This action makes allegations similar to those in the prior
Walnut Place LLC, et al. v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. et al
. lawsuit with respect to an additional securitization trust. On October 7, 2011, the Corporation and Sellers jointly moved to dismiss the complaint.
TMST, Inc. Litigation
On April 29, 2011, the Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee for TMST, Inc. (formerly known as Thornburg Mortgage, Inc.) and for certain affiliated entities (collectively, Thornburg), along with Zuni Investors, LLC (ZI), filed an adversary proceeding in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland entitled
In Re TMST, Inc., f/k/a Thornburg Mortgage, Inc.
against CHL and the Corporation. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on July 29, 2011, in which they allege, among other things, that CHL sold residential mortgage loans to Thornburg pursuant to two agreements, and that CHL allegedly breached certain representations and warranties contained in those agreements concerning property appraisals, prudent and customary loan origination practices, accuracy of mortgage loan schedules, and occupancy status. The complaint further alleges that those loans were deposited by Thornburg into a securitization trust, that ZI purchased certificates issued by that trust, and that the securitization trustee subsequently assigned to ZI and the bankruptcy trustee the right to pursue representation and warranty claims. Plaintiffs seek a court order requiring CHL to repurchase the mortgage loans at issue, or alternatively, unspecified damages for alleged breach of contract. CHL and the Corporation have filed motions to dismiss the case, to withdraw the reference to the Bankruptcy Court, and for transfer of venue to the United States District Court for the Central District of California.
U.S. Bank Litigation
On August 29, 2011, U.S. Bank, National Association (U.S. Bank), as trustee for the HarborView Mortgage Loan Trust 2005-10 (the Trust), a mortgage pool backed by loans originated by CHL, filed a complaint in New York Supreme Court, New York County, in a case entitled
U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee for HarborView Mortgage Loan Trust, Series 2005-10 v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (dba Bank of America Home Loans), Bank of America Corporation, Countrywide Financial Corporation, Bank of America, N.A., and NB Holdings Corporation.
U.S. Bank seeks a declaration that, as a result of alleged misrepresentations by CHL in connection with its sale of the loans, defendants must repurchase the loans. U.S. Bank further asserts that defendants are liable for breach of contract for the alleged failure to repurchase a subset of those loans. Defendants removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. U.S. Bank filed a motion to remand which is currently pending. On February 7, 2012, the JPML issued an order transferring the case to the Countrywide RMBS MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.
 
Mortgage Servicing Investigations and Litigation
The Corporation entered into a consent order with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on April 13, 2011, which requires servicers to make several enhancements to their servicing operations, including implementation of a single point of contact model for borrowers throughout the loss mitigation and foreclosure processes, adoption of measures designed to ensure that foreclosure activity is halted once a borrower has been approved for a modification unless the borrower fails to make payments under the modified loan and implementation of enhanced controls over third-party vendors that provide default servicing support services. In addition, the consent order required that servicers retain an independent consultant, approved by the OCC, to conduct a review of all foreclosure actions pending, or foreclosure sales that occurred between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2010 and submit a plan to the OCC to remediate all financial injury to borrowers caused by any deficiencies identified through the review. The review is comprised of two parts: a sample file review conducted by the independent consultant, which began in October 2011, and file reviews by the independent consultant based upon requests for review from customers with in-scope foreclosures. The Corporation began outreach to those customers in November 2011 and additional outreach efforts are underway. Because the review process is available to a large number of potentially eligible borrowers and involves an examination of many details and documents, each review could take several months to complete. The Corporation cannot yet accurately determine how many borrowers will request a review, how many borrowers will meet the eligibility requirements or how much in compensation might ultimately be paid to eligible borrower.
On February 9, 2012, the Corporation reached agreements in principle (collectively, the Servicing Resolution Agreements) with (i) the DOJ, various federal regulatory agencies and 49 attorneys general to resolve federal and state investigations into certain origination, servicing and foreclosure practices (the Global AIP), (ii) the Federal Housing Administration (the FHA) to resolve certain claims relating to the origination of FHA-insured mortgage loans, primarily by Countrywide prior to and for a period following the acquisition of that lender (the FHA AIP) and (iii) each of the Federal Reserve and the OCC regarding civil monetary penalties related to conduct that was the subject of consent orders entered into with the banking regulators in April 2011 (the Consent Order AIPs).
The Servicing Resolution Agreements are subject to ongoing discussions among the parties and completion and execution of definitive documentation, as well as required regulatory and court approvals. The Global AIP is subject to, among other things, Federal court approval in the United States District Court in the District of Columbia and regulatory approvals of the United States Department of the Treasury and other federal agencies. The Consent Order AIPs are subject to, among other things, the finalization of the Global AIP.
The Global AIP calls for the establishment of certain uniform servicing standards, upfront cash payments of approximately
$1.9 billion
to the state and federal governments and for borrower restitution, approximately
$7.6 billion
in borrower assistance in the form of, among other things, principal reduction, short sales and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure, and approximately
$1.0 billion
of refinancing assistance. The Corporation could be required to make additional payments if it fails to meet its borrower assistance and
refinancing assistance commitments over a three-year period. In addition, the Corporation could be required to pay an additional
$350 million
if the Corporation fails to meet certain first-lien principal reduction thresholds over a three-year period. The Corporation also entered into agreements with several states under which it committed to perform certain minimum levels of principal reduction and related activities within those states as part of the Global AIP, and under which it could be required to make additional payments if it fails to meet such minimum levels. The Corporation may also incur additional operating costs (e.g., servicing costs) to implement certain terms of the Global AIP in future periods. The FHA AIP provides for an upfront cash payment by the Corporation of
$500 million
. The FHA would release the Corporation from all claims arising from loans originated prior to April 30, 2009 that were submitted for FHA insurance claim payments prior to January 1, 2012, and from multiple damages and penalties for loans that were originated on or before April 30, 2009, but had not been submitted for FHA insurance claim payment. The Corporation would have the obligation to pay an additional
$500 million
if the Corporation fails to meet certain principal reduction thresholds over a three-year period.
Pursuant to an agreement in principle, the OCC agreed to hold in abeyance the imposition of a civil monetary penalty of
$164 million
. Pursuant to a separate agreement in principle, the Federal Reserve will assess a civil monetary penalty in the amount of
$176 million
against the Corporation. Satisfying its payment, borrower assistance and remediation obligations under the Global AIP will satisfy any civil monetary penalty obligations arising under these agreements in principle. If, however, the Corporation does not make certain required payments or undertake certain required actions under the Global AIP, the OCC will assess, and the Federal Reserve will require the Corporation to pay the difference between the aggregate value of the payments and actions under these agreements in principle and the penalty amounts.
Under the terms of the Global AIP, the federal and participating state governments would release the Corporation from further liability for certain alleged residential mortgage origination, servicing and foreclosure deficiencies. In settling origination issues related to FHA guaranteed loans originated on or before April 30
,
2009, the FHA would provide the Corporation and its affiliates a release for all claims with respect to such loans if an insurance claim had been submitted to the FHA prior to January 1, 2012 and a release of multiple damages and penalties (but not single damages) if no such claim had been submitted.
The Servicing Resolution Agreements do not cover claims arising out of securitization, including representations made to investors respecting MBS, criminal claims, private claims by borrowers, claims by certain states for injunctive relief or actual economic damages to borrowers related to the Mortgage Electronic Registration System, and claims by the GSEs (including repurchase demands), among other items.
The Corporation continues to be subject to additional borrower and non-borrower litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny related to its past and current servicing and foreclosure activities, including those claims not covered by the Servicing Resolution Agreements. This scrutiny may extend beyond the Corporations pending foreclosure matters to issues arising out of alleged irregularities with respect to previously completed foreclosure activities. The current environment of heightened regulatory scrutiny may subject the Corporation to inquiries or investigations.
 
Ocala Litigation
BNP Paribas Mortgage Corporation and Deutsche Bank AG each filed claims (the 2009 Actions) against BANA in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entitled
BNP Paribas Mortgage Corporation v. Bank of America, N.A.
and
Deutsche Bank AG v. Bank of America, N.A
. Plaintiffs allege that BANA failed to properly perform its duties as indenture trustee, collateral agent, custodian and depositary for Ocala Funding, LLC (Ocala), a home mortgage warehousing facility, resulting in the loss of plaintiffs investment in Ocala. Ocala was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Taylor, Bean & Whitaker Mortgage Corp. (TBW), a home mortgage originator and servicer which is alleged to have committed fraud that led to its eventual bankruptcy. Ocala provided funding for TBWs mortgage origination activities by issuing notes, the proceeds of which were to be used by TBW to originate home mortgages. Such mortgages and other Ocala assets in turn were pledged to BANA, as collateral agent, to secure the notes. Plaintiffs lost most or all of their investment in Ocala when, as the result of the alleged fraud committed by TBW, Ocala was unable to repay the notes purchased by plaintiffs and there was insufficient collateral to satisfy Ocalas debt obligations. Plaintiffs allege that BANA breached its contractual, fiduciary and other duties to Ocala, thereby permitting TBWs alleged fraud to go undetected. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages and other relief from BANA, including interest and attorneys fees, in an unspecified amount, but which plaintiffs allege exceeds
$1.6 billion
.
On March 23, 2011, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York issued an order granting in part and denying in part BANAs motions to dismiss the 2009 Actions. The court dismissed plaintiffs claims against BANA in its capacity as custodian and depositary, as well as plaintiffs claims for contractual indemnification and other claims. The court retained the claims questioning BANAs performance as indenture trustee and collateral agent. Finally, the court agreed with BANA that plaintiffs may not pursue claims for any breach that arose prior to July 20, 2009 (the date on which plaintiffs purchased the last issuance of Ocala notes). On December 29, 2011, plaintiffs moved for leave to amend their complaints to include additional contractual, tort and equitable claims.
On June 22, 2011, BANA filed third-party complaints in the 2009 Actions against BNP Paribas Securities Corp. (BNP Securities) and Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. (Deutsche Securities) seeking contribution for damages sustained by BANA in the underlying actions. BNP Securities and Deutsche Securities (collectively, the Note Dealers) served as note dealers and private placement agents for the Ocala notes that are the subject of the underlying actions. On September 15, 2011, the Note Dealers moved to dismiss the third-party complaints.
On August 30, 2010, plaintiffs each filed new lawsuits (the 2010 Actions) against BANA in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entitled
BNP Paribas Mortgage Corporation v. Bank of America, N.A.
and
Deutsche Bank AG v. Bank of America, N.A.
, which the parties agreed to transfer to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York as related to the 2009 Actions. On December 29, 2011, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the 2010 Actions without prejudice and moved for leave to amend their complaints in the 2009 Actions, as discussed above.
On October 1, 2010, BANA, on behalf of Ocalas investors, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the FDIC as receiver of Colonial Bank, TBWs primary bank, and Platinum Community Bank (Platinum, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of TBW) entitled
Bank of America, National Association as indenture trustee, custodian and collateral agent for Ocala Funding, LLC v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
. The suit seeks judicial review of the FDICs denial of the administrative claims brought by BANA in the FDICs Colonial and Platinum receivership proceedings. BANAs claims allege that Ocalas losses were in whole or in part the result of Colonial and Platinums participation in TBWs alleged fraud. BANA seeks a court order requiring the FDIC to allow BANAs claims in an amount equal to Ocalas losses and, accordingly, to permit BANA, as trustee, collateral agent, custodian and depositary for Ocala, to share appropriately in distributions of any receivership assets that the FDIC makes to creditors of the two failed banks.
On March 14, 2011, the FDIC moved to dismiss BANAs action, primarily on the ground that Ocala Funding had not exhausted its administrative remedies. BANA filed an amended complaint alleging that it had exhausted its administrative remedies. On August 5, 2011, the FDIC answered and moved to dismiss the amended complaint, and asserted counterclaims against BANA in its individual capacity seeking approximately
$900 million
in damages. The counterclaims allege that Colonial sent
4,808
loans to BANA as bailee; that BANA converted the loans into Ocala collateral without first ensuring that Colonial was paid; and that Colonial was never paid for these loans. BANA filed an opposition to the FDICs motion to dismiss on October 21, 2011, along with a motion to dismiss the FDICs counterclaims.
NOTE 15 
Shareholders Equity
Common Stock
In November 2011, August 2011, May 2011 and January 2011, the Corporations Board of Directors (the Board) declared the fourth, third, second and first quarter cash dividends of
$0.01
per common share, which were paid on December 23, 2011, September 23, 2011, June 24, 2011 and March 25, 2011 to common shareholders of record on December 2, 2011, September 2, 2011, June 3, 2011 and March 4, 2011, respectively. In addition, in January 2012, the Board declared a first quarter cash dividend of
$0.01
per common share payable on March 23, 2012 to common shareholders of record on March 2, 2012.
In connection with the exchanges described below in Preferred Stock, the Corporation issued
400 million
shares of common stock.
On September 1, 2011, the Corporation closed the sale to Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (Berkshire) of
50,000
shares of the Series T Preferred Stock and a warrant (the Warrant) to purchase
700 million
shares of the Corporations common stock for an aggregate purchase price of
$5.0 billion
in cash. Of the
$5.0 billion
in cash proceeds,
$2.9 billion
was allocated to preferred stock and
$2.1 billion
to the Warrant on a relative fair value basis. The discount on the Series T Preferred Stock is not subject to accretion. The portion of proceeds allocated to the Warrant was recorded as additional paid-in capital. The Warrant is exercisable at the holders option at any time, in whole or in part until September 1, 2021, at an exercise price of
$7.142857
per share of common stock. The Warrant may be settled in cash or by exchanging all or a portion of the Series T Preferred Stock. For additional information on the Berkshire investment and Series T Preferred Stock, see Preferred Stock in this Note.
 
On February 23, 2010, the Corporation held a special meeting of stockholders at which it obtained shareholder approval of an amendment to the Corporations amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from
10.0 billion
to
11.3 billion
. On April 28, 2010, at the Corporations 2010 annual meeting of stockholders, the Corporation obtained shareholder approval of an amendment to the Corporations amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from
11.3 billion
to
12.8 billion
.
In January 2009, the Corporation issued
1.4 billion
shares of common stock in connection with its acquisition of Merrill Lynch. During
2009
and
2008
, in connection with preferred stock issuances to the U.S. government under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the Corporation issued warrants to purchase
121.8 million
shares of common stock at an exercise price of
$30.79
per share and
150.4 million
shares of common stock at an exercise price of
$13.30
per share. The U.S. Treasury auctioned these warrants in March 2010.
In May 2009, the Corporation issued
1.3 billion
shares of its common stock at an average price of
$10.77
per share through an at-the-market issuance program resulting in gross proceeds of approximately
$13.5 billion
.
In connection with employee stock plans in
2011
, the Corporation issued approximately
51 million
shares and repurchased approximately
28 million
shares of its common stock to satisfy tax withholding obligations. At
December 31, 2011
, the Corporation had reserved
2.2 billion
unissued shares of common stock for future issuances under employee stock plans, common stock warrants, convertible notes and preferred stock.
There is no existing Board authorized share repurchase program.
Preferred Stock
During both
2011
and
2010
, the dividends declared on preferred stock were
$1.4 billion
, and
$4.5 billion
for
2009
.
In
2011
, the Corporation entered into separate agreements with certain institutional preferred and Trust Security holders (the Exchange Agreements) pursuant to which the Corporation and each security holder agreed to exchange shares, or depository shares representing fractional interests in shares, of various series of the Corporations preferred stock, par value
$0.01
per share, or Trust Securities for an aggregate of
400 million
shares of the Corporations common stock valued at
$2.2 billion
and
$2.3 billion
aggregate principal amount of senior notes. The exchanges, in the aggregate, increased Tier 1 common capital by
$3.9 billion
, or approximately
29 bps
. The Exchange Agreements related to Trust Securities are described in
Note 13  Long-term Debt
and the Exchange Agreements related to preferred stock are described below.
As part of the Exchange Agreements, the Corporation exchanged non-convertible preferred stock, with an aggregate liquidation preference of
$815 million
and carrying value of
$814 million
, for
72 million
shares of common stock valued at
$399 million
and senior notes valued at
$231 million
. The
$184 million
difference between the carrying value of the non-convertible preferred stock and the fair value of the consideration issued to the holders of the non-convertible preferred stock was recorded in retained earnings as a non-cash reduction to preferred stock dividends.
Additionally, as a part of the Exchange Agreements, a portion of the Series L
7.25%
Non-Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock (Series L Preferred Stock) with an aggregate liquidation preference and carrying value of
$269 million
was exchanged for
20 million
common shares valued at
$123 million
and senior notes valued at
$129 million
. The
$17 million
difference between the carrying value of the Series L Preferred Stock and the fair value of the consideration issued to holders of the Series L Preferred Stock was reclassified from preferred stock to common stock and additional paid-in capital. Because the number of common shares issued to the Series L Preferred Stock holders was in excess of the number of common shares issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms, the
$220 million
fair value of consideration transferred to the Series L Preferred Stock holders in excess of the
$32 million
fair value of securities issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms was recorded as a non-cash preferred stock dividend. The dividend did not impact total shareholders equity as it reduced retained earnings and increased common stock and additional paid-in capital by the same amount.
The table below lists the aggregate liquidation value of each series of preferred stock exchanged.
The Series T Preferred Stock issued as part of the Berkshire investment has a liquidation value of
$100,000
per share and dividends on the Series T Preferred Stock accrue on the liquidation value at a rate per annum of
six percent
but will be paid only when and if declared by the Board out of legally available funds. Subject to the approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Series T Preferred Stock may be redeemed by the Corporation at any time at a redemption price of
$105,000
per share plus any accrued, unpaid dividends. The Series T Preferred Stock has no maturity date and ranks senior to the outstanding common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions in liquidation. At any time when dividends on the Series T Preferred Stock have not been paid in full, the unpaid amounts will accrue dividends at a rate per annum of
eight percent
and the Corporation will not be permitted to pay dividends or other distributions on, or to repurchase, any outstanding common stock or any of the Corporations outstanding preferred stock of any series. Following payment in full of accrued but unpaid dividends
 
on the Series T Preferred Stock, the dividend rate remains at
eight percent
per annum.
In connection with the Merrill Lynch acquisition, Merrill Lynch non-convertible preferred shareholders received Bank of America Corporation preferred stock having substantially identical terms. On October 15, 2010, all of the outstanding shares of the mandatory convertible preferred stock of Merrill Lynch automatically converted into an aggregate of
50 million
shares of the Corporations common stock in accordance with the terms of these preferred securities.
In January 2009, in connection with TARP and the Merrill Lynch acquisition, the Corporation issued to the U.S. Treasury non-voting perpetual preferred stock for
$30.0 billion
.
In December 2009, the Corporation repurchased the non-voting perpetual preferred stock previously issued to the U.S. Treasury (TARP Preferred Stock) in 2009 and 2008 through the use of
$25.7 billion
in excess liquidity and
$19.3 billion
in proceeds from the sale of
1.3 billion
Common Equivalent Securities (CES) valued at
$15.00
per unit. The CES consisted of depositary shares representing interests in shares of Common Equivalent Junior Preferred Stock, Series S (Common Equivalent Stock) and contingent warrants to purchase an aggregate of
60 million
shares of the Corporations common stock. On February 23, 2010, the Corporation held a special meeting of stockholders at which it obtained shareholder approval of an amendment to the Corporations amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock. Accordingly, the Common Equivalent Stock automatically converted in full into
1.286 billion
shares of common stock on February 24, 2010. In addition, as a result, the contingent warrants expired without having become exercisable and the CES ceased to exist.
During
2009
, the Corporation entered into agreements with certain holders of non-government perpetual preferred stock to exchange their holdings of approximately
$7.3 billion
aggregate liquidation preference, before third-party issuance costs, of
323 million
shares of perpetual preferred stock for
545 million
shares of common stock with a fair value of
$6.1 billion
. In addition, the Corporation exchanged
$3.9 billion
aggregate liquidation preference, before third-party issuance costs, of
144 million
shares of non-government preferred stock for
200 million
shares of common stock in an exchange offer with a fair value of stock issued of
$2.5 billion
. In total, these exchanges resulted in the exchange of
$11.3 billion
aggregate liquidation preference, before third-party issuance costs, or
467 million
shares of preferred stock into
745 million
shares of common stock with a fair value of
$8.6 billion
.
In addition, during
2009
, the Corporation exchanged
3.6 million
shares, or
$3.6 billion
aggregate liquidation preference of Series L Preferred Stock into
255 million
shares of common stock with a fair value of
$2.8 billion
, which was accounted for as an induced conversion of preferred stock.
As a result of these 2009 exchanges, the Corporation recorded an increase to retained earnings and net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders of
$576 million
. This represents the net of a
$2.62 billion
benefit due to the excess of the carrying value of the Corporations non-convertible preferred stock over the fair value of the common stock exchanged, partially offset by a
$2.04 billion
inducement representing the excess of the fair value of the common stock exchanged over the fair value of the common stock that would have been issued under the original conversion terms.
The table below presents a summary of perpetual preferred stock previously issued by the Corporation and remaining outstanding at
December 31, 2011
.
n/a = not applicable
Series L Preferred Stock listed in the Preferred Stock Summary table does not have early redemption/call rights. Each share of the Series L Preferred Stock may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into
20
shares of the Corporations common stock plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. On or after January 30, 2013, the Corporation may cause some or all of the Series L Preferred Stock, at its option, at any time or from time to time, to be converted into shares of common stock at the then-applicable conversion rate if, for
20
trading days during any period of
30
consecutive trading days, the closing price of common stock exceeds
130 percent
of the then-applicable conversion price of the Series L Preferred Stock. If the Corporation exercises its rights to cause the automatic conversion of Series L Preferred Stock on January 30, 2013, it will still pay any accrued dividends payable on January 30, 2013 to the applicable holders of record.
All series of preferred stock in the Preferred Stock Summary table have a par value of
$0.01
per share, are not subject to the operation of a sinking fund, have no participation rights, and with the exception of the Series L Preferred Stock, are not convertible.
 
The holders of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series 1 through 8 Preferred Stock have general voting rights, and the holders of the other series included in the table have no general voting rights. All outstanding series of preferred stock of the Corporation have preference over the Corporations common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of the Corporations assets in the event of a liquidation or dissolution. With the exception of the Series T Preferred Stock, if any dividend payable on these series is in arrears for
three
or more semi-annual or
six
or more quarterly dividend periods, as applicable (whether consecutive or not), the holders of these series and any other class or series of preferred stock ranking equally as to payment of dividends and upon which equivalent voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (voting as a single class), will be entitled to vote for the election of
two
additional directors. These voting rights terminate when the Corporation has paid in full dividends on these series for at least
two
semi-annual or
four
quarterly dividend periods, as applicable, following the dividend arrearage.

The calculation of EPS and diluted EPS for
2011
,
2010
and
2009
is presented below. See
Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Principles
for additional information on the calculation of EPS.
Due to the net loss applicable to common shareholders for
2010
and
2009
, no dilutive potential common shares were included in the calculation of diluted EPS because they would have been antidilutive.
For
2011
,
2010
and
2009
, average options to purchase
217 million
,
271 million
and
315 million
shares, respectively, of common stock were outstanding but not included in the computation of EPS because they were antidilutive under the treasury stock method. For both
2011
and
2010
, average warrants to purchase
272 million
shares of common stock and
265 million
for 2009, were outstanding but not included in the computation of EPS because they were antidilutive under the treasury stock method. For
2011

66 million
average dilutive potential common shares associated with the Series L Preferred Stock were excluded from the diluted share count because the result would have been antidilutive under the if-converted method. For
2010
and
2009
,
107 million
and
147 million
average dilutive potential common shares associated with the Series L Preferred Stock, and the mandatory convertible Preferred Stock Series 2 and Series 3 of Merrill Lynch were excluded from the diluted share count because the result would have been antidilutive under the if-converted method. For
2009
,
81 million
average dilutive potential common shares associated with the CES were excluded from the diluted share count because the result would have been antidilutive under the if-converted method. For
2011
,
234 million
average dilutive potential common shares associated with the Series T Preferred Stock issued in 2011 were excluded from the diluted share count because the result would have been antidilutive under the if-converted method.
For purposes of computing basic EPS, CES were considered to be participating securities prior to February 24, 2010, however, due to a net loss for
2010
, earnings were not allocated to the CES. The two-class method prohibits allocation of an undistributed loss to participating securities. For purposes of computing diluted EPS, there was no dilutive effect of the CES, which were outstanding prior to February 24, 2010, due to a net loss for
2010
.
 
In
2011
, in connection with the exchanges described in
Note 15  Shareholders Equity
, the Corporation recorded a net
$36 million
non-cash preferred stock dividend which is included in the calculation of net income allocated to common shareholders.
For
2009
, as a result of repurchasing the TARP Preferred Stock, the Corporation accelerated the remaining accretion of the issuance discount on the TARP Preferred Stock of
$4.0 billion
and recorded a corresponding charge to retained earnings and income (loss) applicable to common shareholders in the calculation of diluted EPS. In addition, in
2009
, the Corporation recorded an increase to retained earnings and net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders of
$576 million
related to the Corporations preferred stock exchange for common stock.
NOTE 18 
Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions
The Federal Reserve requires the Corporations banking subsidiaries to maintain reserve balances based on a percentage of certain deposits. Average daily reserve balances required by the Federal Reserve were
$14.6 billion
and
$12.9 billion
for
2011
and
2010
. Currency and coin residing in branches and cash vaults (vault cash) are used to partially satisfy the reserve requirement. The average daily reserve balances, in excess of vault cash, held with the Federal Reserve amounted to
$6.5 billion
and
$5.5 billion
for
2011
and
2010
.
The primary sources of funds for cash distributions by the Corporation to its shareholders are dividends received from its banking subsidiaries, Bank of America, N.A. and FIA Card Services, N.A. In
2011
, the Corporation received
$9.8 billion
in dividends from Bank of America, N.A. and FIA Card Services, N.A., returned capital of
$7.0 billion
to the Corporation. In 2012, Bank of America, N.A. and FIA Card Services, N.A. can declare and pay dividends to the Corporation of
$4.5 billion
and
$0
plus an additional amount equal to their net profits for
2012
, as defined by statute, up to the date of any such dividend declaration. The other subsidiary national banks can pay dividends in aggregate of
$1.0 billion
in
2012
plus an additional amount equal to their net profits for
2012
, as defined by statute, up to the date of any such dividend
declaration. The amount of dividends that each subsidiary bank may declare in a calendar year without approval by the OCC is the subsidiary banks net profits for that year combined with its net retained profits, as defined, for the preceding two years.
The Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC (collectively, joint agencies) have in place regulatory capital guidelines for U.S. banking organizations. Failure to meet the capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material effect on the Corporations financial position. The regulatory capital guidelines measure capital in relation to the credit and market risks of both on- and off-balance sheet items using various risk weights. Under the regulatory capital guidelines, Total capital consists of three tiers of capital. Tier 1 capital includes qualifying common shareholders equity, qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, qualifying Trust Securities, hybrid securities and qualifying non-controlling interests, less goodwill and other adjustments. Tier 2 capital consists of qualifying subordinated debt, a limited portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses, a portion of net unrealized gains on AFS marketable equity securities and other adjustments. Tier 3 capital includes subordinated debt that is unsecured, fully paid, has an original maturity of at least two years, is not redeemable before maturity without prior approval by the Federal Reserve and includes a lock-in clause precluding payment of either interest or principal if the payment would cause the issuing banks risk-based capital ratio to fall or remain below the required minimum. Tier 3 capital can only be used to satisfy the Corporations market risk capital requirement and may not be used to support its credit risk requirement. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, the Corporation had
no
subordinated debt that qualified as Tier 3 capital.
Certain corporate-sponsored trust companies which issue Trust Securities are not consolidated. In accordance with Federal Reserve guidance, Trust Securities continue to qualify as Tier 1 capital with revised quantitative limits effective March 31, 2011. As a result, the Corporation includes Trust Securities in Tier 1 capital. The Financial Reform Act includes a provision under which the Corporations previously issued and outstanding Trust Securities in the aggregate amount of
$16.1 billion
(approximately
125
bps of Tier 1 capital) at
December 31, 2011
, will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital effective January 1, 2013. This amount excludes
$633 million
of hybrid Trust Securities that are expected to be converted to preferred stock prior to the date of implementation. The exclusion of Trust Securities from Tier 1 capital will be phased in incrementally over a three-year phase-in period. The treatment of Trust Securities during the phase-in period remains unclear and is subject to future rulemaking.
Current limits restrict core capital elements to
15
percent of
 
total core capital elements for internationally active bank holding companies. Internationally active bank holding companies are those that have significant activities in non-U.S. markets with consolidated assets greater than
$250 billion
or on-balance sheet non-U.S. exposure greater than
$10 billion
. In addition, the Federal Reserve revised the qualitative standards for capital instruments included in regulatory capital. At
December 31, 2011
, the Corporations restricted core capital elements comprised
9.1 percent
of total core capital elements. The Corporation is and expects to remain compliant with the revised limits.
To meet minimum, adequately capitalized regulatory requirements, an institution must maintain a Tier 1 capital ratio of
four percent
and a Total capital ratio of
eight percent
. A well-capitalized institution must generally maintain capital ratios
200
 bps higher than the minimum guidelines. The risk-based capital rules have been further supplemented by a Tier 1 leverage ratio, defined as Tier 1 capital divided by quarterly average total assets, after certain adjustments. Well-capitalized bank holding companies must have a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of
four percent
. National banks must maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least
five percent
to be classified as well-capitalized. At
December 31, 2011
, the Corporations Tier 1 capital, Total capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios were
12.40 percent
,
16.75 percent
and
7.53 percent
, respectively. This classifies the Corporation as well-capitalized for regulatory purposes, the highest classification.
Net unrealized gains or losses on AFS debt securities and marketable equity securities, net unrealized gains and losses on derivatives, and employee benefit plan adjustments in shareholders equity are excluded from the calculations of Tier 1 common capital as discussed below, Tier 1 capital and leverage ratios. The Total capital ratio excludes all of the above with the exception of up to
45 percent
of the pre-tax net unrealized gains on AFS marketable equity securities.
The Corporation calculates Tier 1 common capital as Tier 1 capital including any CES less preferred stock, qualifying Trust Securities, hybrid securities and qualifying noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries. CES was included in Tier 1 common capital based upon applicable regulatory guidance and the expectation at December 31, 2009 that the underlying Common Equivalent Junior Preferred Stock, Series S would convert into common stock following shareholder approval of additional authorized shares. Shareholders approved the increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock and the Common Equivalent Stock converted into common stock on February 24, 2010. Tier 1 common capital was
$126.7 billion
and
$125.1 billion
and the Tier 1 common capital ratio was
9.86 percent
and
8.60 percent
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
.
The table below presents actual and minimum required regulatory capital amounts for
2011
and
2010
.

Regulatory Capital Developments
The Corporation manages regulatory capital to adhere to regulatory standards of capital adequacy based on current understanding of the rules and the application of such rules to the Corporations business as currently conducted. The regulatory capital rules as written by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee) continue to evolve.
U.S. banking regulators published a final Basel II rule (Basel II) in December 2007, which requires the Corporation to implement Basel II at the holding company level as well as at certain U.S. bank subsidiaries, establishes requirements for the U.S. implementation and provides detailed requirements for a new regulatory capital framework related to credit and operational risk (Pillar 1), supervisory requirements (Pillar 2) and disclosure requirements (Pillar 3). The Corporation is currently in the Basel II parallel period.
On December 15, 2010, U.S. regulators announced a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) on the Risk-based Capital Guidelines for Market Risk. On December 29, 2011, U.S. regulators issued an NPR that would amend the December 2010 NPR. This amended NPR is expected to increase the capital requirements for the Corporations trading assets and liabilities. The Corporation continues to evaluate the capital impact of the proposed rules and currently anticipates it will be in compliance with any final rules by the projected implementation date in late 2012.
In addition, the Basel Committee issued capital standards entitled Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems, together with liquidity standards discussed below (Basel III) in December 2010. The Corporation expects to be in compliance with the Basel III capital standards within the regulatory timelines. If implemented by U.S. banking regulators as proposed, Basel III could significantly increase the Corporations capital requirements. Basel III and the Financial Reform Act propose the disqualification of Trust Securities from Tier 1 capital, with the Financial Reform Act proposing that the
 
disqualification be phased in from 2013 to 2015. Basel III also proposes the deduction of certain assets from capital (deferred tax assets, MSRs, investments in financial firms and pension assets, among others, within prescribed limitations), the inclusion of accumulated OCI in capital, increased capital for counterparty credit risk, and new minimum capital and buffer requirements. For additional information on deferred tax assets and MSRs, see
Note 21  Income Taxes
and
Note 25  Mortgage Servicing Rights
.
The phase-in period for the capital deductions is proposed to occur in
20 percent
increments from 2014 through 2018 with full implementation by December 31, 2018. An increase in capital requirements for counterparty credit is proposed to be effective January 2013. The phase-in period for the new minimum capital requirements and related buffers is proposed to occur between 2013 and 2019. U.S. banking regulators have indicated a goal to adopt final rules in 2012.
Preparing for the implementation of the new capital rules is a top strategic priority for the Corporation. The Corporation intends to continue to build capital through retaining earnings, actively reducing legacy asset portfolios and implementing other capital related initiatives, including focusing on reducing both higher risk-weighted assets and assets currently deducted, or expected to be deducted under Basel III, from capital.
On June 17, 2011, U.S. banking regulators proposed rules requiring all large bank holding companies (BHCs) to submit a comprehensive capital plan to the Federal Reserve as part of an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). The proposed regulations require BHCs to demonstrate adequate capital to support planned capital actions, such as dividends, share repurchases or other forms of distributing capital. CCAR submissions are subject to approval by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve may require BHCs to provide prior notice under certain circumstances before making a capital distribution. On January 5, 2012, the Corporation submitted a capital plan to the Federal Reserve consistent with the proposed rules.
On July 19, 2011, the Basel Committee published the consultative document Globally systemic important banks: Assessment methodology and the additional loss absorbency requirement which sets out measures for global, systemically important financial institutions including the methodology for measuring systemic importance, the additional capital required (the SIFI buffer) and the arrangements by which they will be phased in. As proposed, the SIFI buffer would be met with additional Tier 1 common equity ranging from
one percent
to
2.5 percent
, and in certain circumstances,
3.5 percent
. This will be phased in from 2016 through 2018. U.S. banking regulators have not yet provided similar rules for U.S. implementation of a SIFI buffer.
Given that the U.S. regulatory agencies have issued neither proposed rulemaking nor supervisory guidance on Basel III, significant uncertainty exists regarding the eventual impacts of Basel III on U.S. financial institutions, including the Corporation. These regulatory changes also require approval by the U.S. regulatory agencies of analytical models used as part of the Corporations capital measurement and assessment, especially in the case of more complex models. If these more complex models are not approved, it could require financial institutions to hold additional capital, which in some cases could be significant.
On December 20, 2011, the Federal Reserve issued proposed rules to implement enhanced supervisory and prudential requirements and the early remediation requirements established under the Financial Reform Act. The enhanced standards include risk-based capital and leverage requirements, liquidity standards, requirements for overall risk management, single-counterparty credit limits, stress test requirements and a debt-to-equity limit for certain companies determined to pose a threat to financial stability. Comments on the proposed rules are due by March 31, 2012. The final rules are likely to influence the Corporations regulatory capital and liquidity planning process, and may impose additional operational and compliance costs on the Corporation.
NOTE 19 
Employee Benefit Plans
Pension and Postretirement Plans
The Corporation sponsors noncontributory trusteed pension plans that cover substantially all officers and employees, a number of noncontributory nonqualified pension plans, and postretirement health and life plans. The plans provide defined benefits based on an employees compensation and years of service. The Bank of America Pension Plan (the Pension Plan) provides participants with compensation credits, generally based on years of service. For account balances based on compensation credits prior to January 1, 2008, the Pension Plan allows participants to select from various earnings measures, which are based on the returns of certain funds or common stock of the Corporation. The participant-selected earnings measures determine the earnings rate on the individual participant account balances in the Pension Plan. Participants may elect to modify earnings measure allocations on a periodic basis subject to the provisions of the Pension Plan. For account balances based on compensation credits subsequent to December 31, 2007, the account balance earnings rate is based on a benchmark rate. For eligible employees
 
in the Pension Plan on or after January 1, 2008, the benefits become vested upon completion of three years of service. It is the policy of the Corporation to fund not less than the minimum funding amount required by ERISA.
The Pension Plan has a balance guarantee feature for account balances with participant-selected earnings, applied at the time a benefit payment is made from the plan that effectively provides principal protection for participant balances transferred and certain compensation credits. The Corporation is responsible for funding any shortfall on the guarantee feature.
As a result of acquisitions, the Corporation assumed the obligations related to the pension plans of certain legacy companies. These acquired pension plans have been merged into a separate defined benefit pension plan which, together with the Pension Plan, are referred to as the Qualified Pension Plans. The benefit structures under these acquired plans have not changed and remain intact in the merged plan. Certain benefit structures are substantially similar to the Pension Plan discussed above; however, certain of these structures do not allow participants to select various earnings measures; rather the earnings rate is based on a benchmark rate. In addition, these benefit structures include participants with benefits determined under formulas based on average or career compensation and years of service rather than by reference to a pension account. Certain of the other benefit structures provide a participants retirement benefits based on the number of years of benefit service and a percentage of the participants average annual compensation during the five highest paid consecutive years of the last ten years of employment.
In connection with a redesign of the Corporations retirement plans, after the end of
2011
, the Corporation announced that it will freeze the benefits earned in the Qualified Pension Plans effective June 30, 2012. The Corporation will continue to offer retirement benefits through its defined contribution plans and will increase its contributions to certain of these plans.
As a result of the Merrill Lynch acquisition, the Corporation assumed the obligations related to the plans of Merrill Lynch. These plans include a terminated U.S. pension plan, non-U.S. pension plans, nonqualified pension plans and postretirement plans. The non-U.S. pension plans vary based on the country and local practices. The terminated U.S. pension plan is referred to as the Other Pension Plan.
In 1988, Merrill Lynch purchased a group annuity contract that guarantees the payment of benefits vested under the terminated U.S. pension plan. The Corporation, under a supplemental agreement, may be responsible for, or benefit from actual experience and investment performance of the annuity assets. The Corporation made no contribution under this agreement in
2011
or
2010
. Contributions may be required in the future under this agreement.
The Corporation sponsors a number of noncontributory, nonqualified pension plans (the Nonqualified Pension Plans). As a result of acquisitions, the Corporation assumed the obligations related to the noncontributory, nonqualified pension plans of certain legacy companies including Merrill Lynch. These plans, which are unfunded, provide defined pension benefits to certain employees.
In addition to retirement pension benefits, full-time, salaried employees and certain part-time employees may become eligible to continue participation as retirees in health care and/or life insurance plans sponsored by the Corporation. Based on the other provisions of the individual plans, certain retirees may also have the cost of these benefits partially paid by the Corporation. The obligations assumed as a result of acquisitions are substantially similar to the Corporations postretirement health and life plans, except for Countrywide which did not have a postretirement health and life plan. Collectively, these plans are referred to as the Postretirement Health and Life Plans.
The Pension and Postretirement Plans table summarizes the changes in the fair value of plan assets, changes in the projected benefit obligation (PBO), the funded status of both the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and the PBO, and the weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the pension plans and postretirement plans at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
. Amounts recognized at
December
 
31, 2011 and 2010
are reflected in other assets, and accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The discount rate assumption is based on a cash flow matching technique and is subject to change each year. This technique utilizes yield curves that are based on Aa-rated corporate bonds with cash flows that match estimated benefit payments of each of the plans to produce the discount rate assumptions. The asset valuation method for the Qualified Pension Plans recognizes
60 percent
of the prior years market gains or losses at the next measurement date with the remaining
40 percent
spread equally over the subsequent four years.
The Corporations best estimate of its contributions to be made to the Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans in
2012
is
$98 million
,
$124 million
and
$115 million
, respectively. The Corporation does not expect to make a contribution to the Qualified Pension plans in
2012
.

Amounts recognized in the Corporations Consolidated Balance Sheet at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
are presented in the table below.
Pension Plans with ABO and PBO in excess of plan assets as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
are presented in the table below. For the non-qualified plans not subject to ERISA or non-U.S. pension plans, funding strategies vary due to legal requirements and local practices.
Net periodic benefit cost for
2011
,
2010
and
2009
included the following components.
n/a = not applicable
Net periodic postretirement health and life expense was determined using the projected unit credit actuarial method. Gains and losses for all benefits except postretirement health care are recognized in accordance with the standard amortization provisions of the applicable accounting guidance. For the Postretirement Health Care Plans,
50 percent
of the unrecognized gain or loss at the beginning of the fiscal year (or at subsequent remeasurement) is recognized on a level basis during the year.
The discount rate and expected return on plan assets impact the net periodic benefit cost recorded for the plans. With all other assumptions held constant, a 25-basis point decline in the discount rate and expected return on plan assets would result in an increase of approximately
$55 million
and
$27 million
for the Qualified Pension Plans. For the Non-U.S. Pension Plans, the Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health
 
and Life Plans, the 25-basis point decline in rates would not have a significant impact.
Assumed health care cost trend rates affect the postretirement benefit obligation and benefit cost reported for the Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure the expected cost of benefits covered by the Postretirement Health and Life Plans was
8.00 percent
for
2012
, reducing in steps to
5.00 percent
in 2019 and later years. A one-percentage-point increase in assumed health care cost trend rates would have increased the service and interest costs, and the benefit obligation by
$4 million
and
$59 million
in
2011
. A one-percentage-point decrease in assumed health care cost trend rates would have lowered the service and interest costs, and the benefit obligation by
$3 million
and
$52 million
in
2011
.
Pre-tax amounts included in accumulated OCI for employee benefit plans at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
are presented in the table below.
Pre-tax amounts recognized in OCI for employee benefit plans in
2011
included the following components.
The estimated pre-tax amounts that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into period cost in
2012
are presented in the table below.
Plan Assets
The Qualified Pension Plans have been established as retirement vehicles for participants, and trusts have been established to secure benefits promised under the Qualified Pension Plans. The Corporations policy is to invest the trust assets in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and defraying reasonable expenses of administration. The Corporations investment strategy is designed to provide a total return that, over the long term, increases the ratio of assets to liabilities. The strategy attempts to maximize the investment return on assets at a level of risk deemed appropriate by the Corporation while complying with ERISA and any applicable regulations and laws. The investment strategy utilizes asset allocation as a principal determinant for establishing the risk/return profile of the assets. Asset allocation ranges are established, periodically reviewed and adjusted as funding levels and liability characteristics change. Active and passive investment managers are employed to help enhance the risk/return profile of the assets. An additional aspect of the investment strategy used
 
to minimize risk (part of the asset allocation plan) includes matching the equity exposure of participant-selected earnings measures. For example, the common stock of the Corporation held in the trust is maintained as an offset to the exposure related to participants who elected to receive an earnings measure based on the return performance of common stock of the Corporation. No plan assets are expected to be returned to the Corporation during
2012
.
The assets of the Non-U.S. Pension Plans are primarily attributable to a U.K. pension plan. This U.K. pension plans assets are invested prudently so that the benefits promised to members are provided with consideration given to the nature and the duration of the plans liabilities. The current planned investment strategy was set following an asset-liability study and advice from the trustees investment advisors. The selected asset allocation strategy is designed to achieve a higher return than the lowest risk strategy while maintaining a prudent approach to meeting the plans liabilities.
The Expected Return on Asset assumption (EROA assumption) was developed through analysis of historical market returns, historical asset class volatility and correlations, current market conditions, anticipated future asset allocations, the funds past experience, and expectations on potential future market returns. The EROA assumption is determined using the calculated market-related value for the Qualified Pension Plans and the Other Pension Plan and the fair value for the Non-U.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The EROA assumption represents a long-term average view of the performance of the assets in the Qualified Pension Plans, the Non-U.S. Pension Plans, the Other Pension Plan, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans, a return that may or may not be achieved during any one calendar
 
year. Some of the building blocks used to arrive at the long-term return assumption include an implied return from equity securities of
8.75 percent
, debt securities of
5.75 percent
and real estate of
7.00 percent
for the Qualified Pension Plans, the Non-U.S. Pension Plans, the Other Pension Plan, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The terminated U.S. pension plan is solely invested in a group annuity contract which is primarily invested in fixed-income securities structured such that asset maturities match the duration of the plans obligations.
The target allocations for
2012
by asset category for the Qualified Pension Plans, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans are presented in the table below.
Equity securities for the Qualified Pension Plans include common stock of the Corporation in the amounts of
$82 million
(
0.55 percent
of total plan assets) and
$189 million
(
1.21 percent
of total plan assets) at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
.
 
Fair Value Measurements

Plan investment assets measured at fair value by level and in total at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
are summarized in the Fair Value Measurements table.

Projected Benefit Payments
Benefit payments projected to be made from the Qualified Pension Plans, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans are presented in the table below.
Defined Contribution Plans
The Corporation maintains qualified defined contribution retirement plans and nonqualified defined contribution retirement plans. As a result of the Merrill Lynch acquisition, the Corporation also maintains the defined contribution plans of Merrill Lynch which include the 401(k) Savings & Investment Plan, the Retirement and Accumulation Plan (RAP) and the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). The Corporation contributed approximately
$723 million
,
$670 million
and
$605 million
in
2011
,
2010
and
2009
, respectively, in cash to the qualified defined contribution plans. At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
,
232 million
shares and
208 million
shares of the Corporations common stock were held by these plans. Payments to the plans for dividends on common stock were
$9 million
,
$8 million
and
$8 million
in
2011
,
2010
and
2009
, respectively.
In addition, certain non-U.S. employees within the Corporation are covered under defined contribution pension plans that are separately administered in accordance with local laws.
NOTE 20 
Stock-based Compensation Plans
The Corporation administers a number of equity compensation plans, including the Key Employee Stock Plan, the Key Associate Stock Plan and the Merrill Lynch Employee Stock Compensation Plan. Descriptions of the significant features of the equity compensation plans are below. Under these plans, the Corporation grants stock-based awards, including stock options, restricted stock shares and RSUs. For grants in
2011
, restricted stock awards generally vest in
three
equal annual installments beginning one year from the grant date.
For most awards, expense is generally recognized ratably over the vesting period net of estimated forfeitures, unless the employee meets certain retirement eligibility criteria. For awards to employees that meet retirement eligibility criteria, the Corporation records the expense upon grant. For employees that become retirement eligible during the vesting period, the Corporation recognizes expense from the grant date to the date on which the employee becomes retirement eligible, net of estimated forfeitures. The compensation cost for the stock-based plans was
$2.6 billion
,
$2.0 billion
and
$2.4 billion
in
2011
,
2010
and
2009
, respectively. The related income tax benefit was
$969 million
,
$727 million
and
$892 million
for
2011
,
2010
and
2009
, respectively.
For capital purposes, the Corporation issued approximately
122 million
of immediately tradable shares of common stock, or approximately
$1.0 billion
(after-tax) to certain employees in February 2012 in lieu of a portion of their
2011
year-end cash incentive.
Key Employee Stock Plan
The Key Employee Stock Plan, as amended and restated, provided for different types of awards including stock options, restricted stock shares and RSUs. Under the plan, 10-year options to purchase approximately
260 million
shares of common stock were granted through
December 31, 2002
to certain employees at the closing market price on the respective grant dates. At
December 31, 2011
, approximately
21 million
fully vested options were outstanding under this plan. No further awards may be granted.
 
Key Associate Stock Plan
The Key Associate Stock Plan became effective
January 1, 2003
. It provides for different types of awards, including stock options, restricted stock shares and RSUs. As of
December 31, 2011
, the shareholders had authorized approximately
1.1 billion
shares for grant under this plan. Additionally, any shares covered by awards under the Key Employee Stock Plan or certain legacy company plans that cancel, terminate, expire, lapse or settle in cash after a specified date may be re-granted under the Key Associate Stock Plan.
During
2011
, the Corporation issued approximately
193 million
RSUs to certain employees under the Key Associate Stock Plan. Certain awards are earned based on the achievement of specified performance criteria. Vested RSUs may be settled in cash or in shares of common stock depending on the terms of the applicable award. In
2011
, approximately
126 million
of these RSUs were authorized to be settled in shares of common stock. Certain awards contain clawback provisions which permit the Corporation to cancel all or a portion of the award under specified circumstances. The compensation
cost for cash-settled awards and awards subject to certain clawback provisions is accrued over the vesting period and is adjusted to fair value based upon changes in the share price of the Corporations common stock. The compensation cost for the remaining awards is fixed and based on the share price of the Corporations common stock on the date of grant. The Corporation hedges a portion of its exposure to variability in the expected cash flows for certain unvested awards using a combination of economic and cash flow hedges as described in
Note 4  Derivatives
.
At
December 31, 2011
, approximately
135 million
options were outstanding under this plan. There were
no
options granted under this plan during
2011
or

Merrill Lynch Employee Stock Compensation Plan
The Corporation assumed the Merrill Lynch Employee Stock Compensation Plan with the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Approximately
8 million
RSUs were granted in
2011
which generally vest in
three
equal annual installments beginning one year from the grant date. There were
no
shares granted under this plan during
2010
. Awards granted in 2009 generally vest in
three
equal annual installments beginning one year from the grant date, and awards granted prior to 2009 generally vest in
four
equal annual installments beginning one year from the grant date. At
December 31, 2011
, there were approximately
20 million
shares outstanding.
Other Stock Plans
As a result of the Merrill Lynch acquisition, the Corporation assumed the obligations of outstanding awards granted under the Merrill Lynch Financial Advisor Capital Accumulation Award Plan (FACAAP) and the Merrill Lynch Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The FACAAP is no longer an active plan and no awards were granted in
2011
or
2010
. Awards granted in 2003 and thereafter are generally payable
eight
years from the grant date in a fixed number of the Corporations common shares. For outstanding awards granted prior to 2003, payment is generally made
ten
years from the grant date in a fixed number of the Corporations common shares unless the fair value of such shares is less than a specified minimum value, in which case the minimum value is paid in cash. At
December 31, 2011
, there were
12 million
shares outstanding under this plan.
The ESPP allows eligible employees to invest from
one percent
to
10 percent
of eligible compensation to purchase the Corporations common stock, subject to legal limits. Purchases were made at a discount of
five percent
of the average high and low market price on the relevant purchase date and the maximum annual contribution per employee was
$23,750
in
2011
. Approximately
107 million
shares were authorized for issuance under the ESPP in 2009. There were
6 million
shares available at
December 31, 2011
.
The weighted-average fair value of the ESPP stock purchase rights representing the
five percent
discount on the Corporations common stock purchases exercised by employees in
2011
was
$0.54
per stock purchase right.
Restricted Stock/Unit Details
The table below presents the status of the share-settled restricted stock/units at
December 31, 2011
and changes during
2011
.
At
December 31, 2011
, there was
$1.2 billion
of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based compensation arrangements for all awards and it is expected to be recognized over a period up to
seven
years, with a weighted
 
average period of
1.4
years. The total fair value of restricted stock vested in
2011
was
$1.7 billion
. In
2011
, the amount of cash paid to settle equity-based awards was
$489 million
, which included cash-settled RSUs not reflected in the Restricted Stock/Unit Details table.
Stock Options
The table below presents the status of all option plans at
December 31, 2011
and changes during
2011
. Outstanding options at
December 31, 2011
include
21 million
options under the Key Employee Stock Plan,
135 million
options under the Key Associate Stock Plan and
52 million
options to employees of predecessor company plans assumed in mergers.
At
December 31, 2011
, there was
no
aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding, exercisable, and vested and expected to vest. The weighted-average remaining contractual term of options outstanding was
2.7
years, options exercisable was
2.6
years, and options vested and expected to vest was
2.6
years at
December 31, 2011
. These remaining contractual terms are similar because options have not been granted since 2008 and they generally vest over
three
years.
NOTE 21 
Income Taxes
The components of income tax expense (benefit) for
2011
,
2010
and
2009
were as presented in the table below.
 
Total income tax expense (benefit) does not reflect the deferred tax effects of unrealized gains and losses on AFS debt and marketable equity securities, foreign currency translation adjustments, derivatives and employee benefit plan adjustments that are included in accumulated OCI. As a result of these tax effects, accumulated OCI increased
$3.0 billion
in
2011
and decreased
$3.2 billion
and
$1.6 billion
in
2010
and
2009
. In addition, total income tax expense (benefit) does not reflect tax effects associated with the Corporations employee stock plans which increased common stock and additional paid-in capital
$19 million
in
2011
and decreased common stock and additional paid-in capital
$98 million
and
$295 million
in
2010
and
2009
.
Income tax expense (benefit) for
2011
,
2010
and
2009
varied from the amount computed by applying the statutory income tax rate to income (loss) before income taxes. A reconciliation between the expected U.S. federal income tax expense using the federal statutory tax rate of
35 percent
to the Corporations actual income tax expense (benefit) and resulting effective tax rate for
2011
,
2010
and
2009
is presented in the Reconciliation of Income Tax Expense (Benefit) table.
n/m = not meaningful
The reconciliation of the beginning unrecognized tax benefits (UTB) balance to the ending balance is presented in the table below.
At
December 31, 2011
,
2010
and
2009
, the balance of the Corporations UTBs which would, if recognized, affect the Corporations effective tax rate was
$3.3 billion
,
$3.4 billion
and
$4.0 billion
, respectively. Included in the UTB balance are some items the recognition of which would not affect the effective tax rate, such as the tax effect of certain temporary differences, the portion of gross state UTBs that would be offset by the tax benefit of the associated federal deduction and the portion of gross non-U.S. UTBs that would be offset by tax reductions in other jurisdictions.
The Corporation files income tax returns in more than
100
state and non-U.S. jurisdictions each year. The IRS and other tax authorities in countries and states in which it has significant business operations examine tax returns periodically (continuously in some jurisdictions). The Tax Examination Status table summarizes the status of significant examinations (U.S. federal unless otherwise noted) for the Corporation and various acquired subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2011
.
During
2011
, the Corporation and IRS made significant progress toward resolving all federal income tax examinations for Bank of America Corporation tax years through
2009
and Merrill Lynch tax years through
2008
. While subject to final agreement, including review by the Joint Committee on Taxation of the U.S. Congress for certain years, the Corporation believes that all federal examinations in the Tax Examination Status table may be concluded during
2012
.
Considering all examinations, it is reasonably possible the UTB balance may decrease by as much as
$2.6 billion
during the next twelve months, since resolved items will be removed from the balance whether their resolution results in payment or recognition. If such decrease were to occur, it likely would primarily result from outcomes consistent with management expectations.
During
2011
and
2010
, the Corporation recognized in income tax expense a benefit of
$168 million
and expense of
$99 million
for interest and penalties net-of-tax. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, the Corporations accrual for interest and penalties that related to income taxes, net of taxes and remittances, was
$787 million
and
$1.1 billion
.
 
Significant components of the Corporations net deferred tax assets and liabilities at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
are presented in the Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities table.
The
2010
U.S. federal deferred tax asset excludes
$56 million
related to certain employee stock plan deductions that was recognized and increased additional paid-in capital in
2011
.
The table below summarizes the deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances recognized for the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards at
December 31, 2011
.
The Corporation concluded that no valuation allowance is necessary to reduce the U.K. NOLs, U.S. NOL and general business credit carryforwards since estimated future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize these assets prior to their expiration. During 2011, the valuation allowance decreased due to the utilization of the remaining acquired capital loss carryforward and increased primarily against net operating loss carryforwards in non-U.S. and state jurisdictions.
At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, U.S. federal income taxes had not been provided on
$18.5 billion
and
$17.9 billion
of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries earned prior to 1987 and after 1997 that have been reinvested for an indefinite period of time. If the earnings were distributed, an additional
$2.5 billion
and
$2.6 billion
of tax expense, net of credits for non-U.S. taxes paid on such earnings and for the related non-U.S. withholding taxes, would have resulted as of
December 31, 2011
and
2010
.
NOTE 22 
Fair Value Measurements
Under applicable accounting guidance, fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established under applicable accounting guidance which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs used to measure fair value. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy and how the Corporation measures fair value, see
Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Principles
. The Corporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the fair value option. For more information, see
Note 23  Fair Value Option
.
Level 1, 2 and 3 Valuation Techniques
Financial instruments are considered Level 1 when the valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 financial instruments are valued using quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or models using inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Financial instruments are considered Level 3 when their values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques, and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable and when determination of the fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.
Trading Account Assets and Liabilities and Available-for-Sale Debt Securities
The fair values of trading account assets and liabilities are primarily based on actively traded markets where prices are based on either direct market quotes or observed transactions. The fair values of AFS debt securities are generally based on quoted market prices or market prices for similar assets. Liquidity is a significant factor in the determination of the fair values of trading account assets
 
and liabilities and AFS debt securities. Market price quotes may not be readily available for some positions, or positions within a market sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased. Some of these instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow model, which estimates the fair value of the securities using internal credit risk, interest rate and prepayment risk models that incorporate managements best estimate of current key assumptions such as default rates, loss severity and prepayment rates. Principal and interest cash flows are discounted using an observable discount rate for similar instruments with adjustments that management believes a market participant would consider in determining fair value for the specific security. Other instruments are valued using a net asset value approach which considers the value of the underlying securities. Underlying assets are valued using external pricing services, where available, or matrix pricing based on the vintages and ratings. Situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by the markets perception of credit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector. In these instances, fair value is determined based on limited available market information and other factors, principally from reviewing the issuers financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by one or more rating agencies.
Derivative Assets and Liabilities
The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the OTC market are determined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. When third-party pricing services are used, the methods and assumptions used are reviewed by the Corporation. Estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions that are either option-based or have longer maturity dates where observable market inputs are less readily available, or are unobservable, in which case, quantitative-based extrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used in determining fair values. The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, counterparty credit quality and other instrument-specific factors, where appropriate. In addition, the Corporation incorporates within its fair value measurements of OTC derivatives a valuation adjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the net position. Positions are netted by counterparty, and fair value for net long exposures is adjusted for counterparty credit risk while the fair value for net short exposures is adjusted for the Corporations own credit risk. An estimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of fair value, primarily based on market data.
Loans and Loan Commitments
The fair values of loans and loan commitments are based on market prices, where available, or discounted cash flow analyses using market-based credit spreads of comparable debt instruments or credit derivatives of the specific borrower or comparable borrowers. Results of discounted cash flow calculations may be adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect other market conditions or the perceived credit risk of the borrower.
Mortgage Servicing Rights
The fair values of MSRs are determined using models that rely on estimates of prepayment rates, the resultant weighted-average lives of the MSRs and the OAS levels. For more information on MSRs, see
Note 25  Mortgage Servicing Rights
.
Loans Held-for-Sale
The fair values of LHFS are based on quoted market prices, where available, or are determined by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporations current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk.
Other Assets
The fair values of AFS marketable equity securities are generally based on quoted market prices or market prices for similar assets. However, non-public investments are initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently adjusted when evidence is available to support such adjustments.
Securities Financing Agreements
The fair values of certain reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions are determined using quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services.
 
Deposits and Other Short-term Borrowings
The fair values of deposits and other short-term borrowings are determined using quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. The Corporation considers the impact of its own credit spreads in the valuation of these liabilities. The credit risk is determined by reference to observable credit spreads in the secondary cash market.
Long-term Debt
The Corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons or repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. The fair values of these structured liabilities are estimated using valuation models for the combined derivative and debt portions of the notes. These models incorporate observable and, in some instances, unobservable inputs including security prices, interest rate yield curves, option volatility, currency, commodity or equity rates and correlations between these inputs. The Corporation considers the impact of its own credit spreads in the valuation of these liabilities. The credit risk is determined by reference to observable credit spreads in the secondary bond market.
Asset-backed Secured Financings
The fair values of asset-backed secured financings are based on external broker bids, where available, or are determined by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporations current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk.
Recurring Fair Value
Assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, including financial instruments which the Corporation accounts for under the fair value option, are summarized in the following tables.
The following tables present a reconciliation of all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during
2011
,
2010
and
2009
, including net realized and unrealized gains (losses) included in earnings and accumulated OCI.
During
2011
, the transfers into Level 3 included
$1.9 billion
of trading account assets,
$1.2 billion
of net derivative assets and
$2.1 billion
of long-term debt accounted for under the fair value option. Transfers into Level 3 for trading account assets were primarily certain CLOs, corporate loans and bonds which were transferred due to decreased market activity. Transfers into Level 3 for net derivative assets were the result of changes in the valuation methodology for certain total return swaps, in addition to increases in certain equity derivatives with significant unobservable inputs. Transfers into Level 3 for long-term debt were primarily due to changes in the impact of unobservable inputs on the value of certain structured liabilities. Transfers occur on a regular basis for these long-term debt instruments based on the fair value of the embedded derivative in relation to the instrument as a whole.
During
2011
, the transfers out of Level 3 included
$1.6 billion
of trading account assets,
$6.3 billion
of AFS debt securities,
$4.4 billion
of loans and leases,
$2.0 billion
of other assets and
$1.6
 
billion
of long-term debt. Transfers out of Level 3 for trading account assets were primarily driven by increased price observability on certain RMBS, commercial mortgage-backed securities and consumer ABS portfolios as well as certain corporate bond positions due to increased trading volume. Transfers out of Level 3 for AFS debt securities primarily related to auto, credit card and student loan ABS portfolios due to increased trading volume in the secondary market for similar securities. Transfers out of Level 3 for loans and leases were driven by increased observable inputs, primarily market comparables, for certain corporate loans accounted for under the fair value option. Transfers out of Level 3 for other assets were primarily the result of an initial public offering of an equity investment. Transfers out of Level 3 for long-term debt were primarily due to changes in the impact of unobservable inputs on the value of certain structured liabilities. Transfers occur on a regular basis for these long-term debt instruments based on the fair value of the embedded derivative in relation to the instrument as a whole.
During
2010
, the transfers into Level 3 included
$3.2 billion
of trading account assets,
$3.5 billion
of AFS debt securities,
$1.1 billion
of net derivative contracts and
$1.9 billion
of long-term debt. Transfers into Level 3 for trading account assets were driven by reduced price transparency as a result of lower levels of trading activity for certain municipal auction rate securities and corporate debt securities as well as a change in valuation methodology for certain ABS to a discounted cash flow model. Transfers into Level 3 for AFS debt securities were due to an increase in the number of non-agency RMBS and other taxable securities priced using a discounted cash flow model. Transfers into Level 3 for net derivative contracts were primarily related to a lack of price
 
observability for certain credit default and total return swaps. Transfers into Level 3 for long-term debt were primarily due to changes in the impact of unobservable inputs on the value of certain structured liabilities.
During
2010
, the transfers out of Level 3 included
$3.4 billion
of trading account assets and
$1.8 billion
of long-term debt. Transfers out of Level 3 for trading account assets were driven by increased price verification of certain MBS, corporate debt and non-U.S. government and agency securities. Transfers out of Level 3 for long-term debt were primarily due to changes in the impact of unobservable inputs on the value of certain structured liabilities.
The following tables summarize gains (losses) due to changes in fair value, including both realized and unrealized gains (losses), recorded in earnings for Level 3 assets and liabilities during
2011
,
2010
and
2009
. These amounts include gains (losses) on loans, LHFS, loan commitments and structured liabilities that are accounted for under the fair value option.
The following tables summarize changes in unrealized gains (losses) recorded in earnings during
2011
,
2010
and
2009
for Level 3 assets and liabilities that were still held at
December 31, 2011
,
2010
and
2009
. These amounts include changes in fair value on loans, LHFS, loan commitments and structured liabilities that are accounted for under the fair value option.
Nonrecurring Fair Value
The Corporation held certain assets that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and are not included in the previous tables in this Note. These assets primarily include LHFS, certain loans and leases, and foreclosed properties. The amounts below represent only balances measured at fair value during
2011
,
2010
and
2009
, and still held as of the reporting date.
 
NOTE 23 
Fair Value Option
Loans and Loan Commitments
The Corporation elected to account for certain consumer and commercial loans and loan commitments that exceeded the Corporations single name credit risk concentration guidelines under the fair value option. Lending commitments, both funded and unfunded, are actively managed and monitored and, as appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships may be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with the Corporations public side credit view and market perspectives determining the size and timing of the hedging activity. These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for designation as accounting hedges and therefore are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income (loss). Electing the fair value option allows the Corporation to carry these loans and loan commitments at fair value, which is more consistent with managements view of the underlying economics and the manner in which they are managed. In addition, election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the economic hedges at fair value. An immaterial portion of the changes in fair value for these loans was attributable to changes in borrower-specific credit risk.
Loans Held-for-Sale
The Corporation elected to account for residential mortgage LHFS, commercial mortgage LHFS and other LHFS under the fair value option with interest income on these LHFS recorded in other interest income. The changes in fair value are largely offset by hedging activities. An immaterial portion of the changes in fair value for these loans was attributable to changes in borrower-specific credit risk. Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the economic hedges at fair value. The Corporation has not elected to account for other LHFS under the fair value option primarily because these loans are floating-rate loans that are not economically hedged using derivative instruments.
Loans Reported as Trading Account Assets
The Corporation elected to account for certain loans that are risk-managed on a fair value basis under the fair value option. An immaterial portion of the changes in fair value for these loans was attributable to changes in borrower-specific credit risk.
Other Assets
The Corporation elected to account for certain private equity investments that are not in an investment company under the fair value option as this measurement basis is consistent with applicable accounting guidance for similar investments that are in an investment company.
Securities Financing Agreements
The Corporation elected to account for certain securities financing agreements, including resale and repurchase agreements, under the fair value option based on the tenor of the agreements, which reflects the magnitude of the interest rate risk. The majority of securities financing agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities are not accounted for under the fair value option as these contracts are generally short-dated and therefore the interest rate risk is not significant.
 
Long-term Deposits
The Corporation elected to account for certain long-term fixed-rate and rate-linked deposits that are economically hedged with derivatives under the fair value option. Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the economic hedges at fair value. The Corporation did not elect to carry other long-term deposits at fair value because they were not economically hedged using derivatives.
Other Short-term Borrowings
The Corporation elected to account for certain other short-term borrowings under the fair value option because this debt is risk-managed on a fair value basis.
Long-term Debt
The Corporation elected to account for certain long-term debt, primarily structured liabilities, under the fair value option. This long-term debt is risk-managed on a fair value basis. Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for these financial instruments at historical cost and the economic hedges at fair value.
Asset-backed Secured Financings
The Corporation elected to account for certain asset-backed secured financings, which are classified in other short-term borrowings, under the fair value option. Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the asset-backed secured financings at historical cost and the corresponding mortgage LHFS securing these financings at fair value.
The table below provides information about the fair value carrying amount and the contractual principal outstanding of assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
.
n/a = not applicable
The following tables provide information about where changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option are included in the Consolidated Statement of Income for
2011
,
2010
and
2009
.
NOTE 24 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair values of financial instruments have been derived using methodologies described in
Note 22  Fair Value Measurements
. The following disclosures include financial instruments where only a portion of the ending balance at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
was carried at fair value on the Corporations Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Short-term Financial Instruments
The carrying value of short-term financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, time deposits placed, federal funds sold and purchased, resale and certain repurchase agreements, and other short-term investments and borrowings approximates the fair value of these instruments. These financial instruments generally expose the Corporation to limited credit risk and have
 
no stated maturities or have short-term maturities and carry interest rates that approximate market. The Corporation elected to account for certain repurchase agreements under the fair value option.
Loans
Fair values were generally determined by discounting both principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected using an observable discount rate for similar instruments with adjustments that the Corporation believes a market participant would consider in determining fair value. The Corporation estimates the cash flows expected to be collected using internal credit risk, interest rate and prepayment risk models that incorporate the Corporations best estimate of current key assumptions, such as default rates, loss severity and prepayment speeds for the life of the loan. The
carrying value of loans is presented net of the applicable allowance for loan losses and excludes leases. The Corporation elected to account for certain large corporate loans that exceeded the Corporations single name credit risk concentration guidelines under the fair value option.
Deposits
The fair value for certain deposits with stated maturities was determined by discounting contractual cash flows using current market rates for instruments with similar maturities. The carrying value of non-U.S. time deposits approximates fair value. For deposits with no stated maturities, the carrying value was considered to approximate fair value and does not take into account the significant value of the cost advantage and stability of the Corporations long-term relationships with depositors. The Corporation accounts for certain long-term fixed-rate deposits that are economically hedged with derivatives under the fair value option.
Long-term Debt
The Corporation uses quoted market prices, when available, to estimate fair value for its long-term debt. When quoted market prices are not available, fair value is estimated based on current market interest rates and credit spreads for debt with similar terms and maturities. The Corporation accounts for certain structured liabilities under the fair value option.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying values and fair values of certain financial instruments where only a portion of the ending balance at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
was carried at fair value are presented in the table below.
 
NOTE 25 
Mortgage Servicing Rights
The Corporation accounts for consumer MSRs at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income in mortgage banking income (loss). The Corporation economically hedges these MSRs with certain derivatives and securities including MBS and U.S. Treasuries. The securities that economically hedge the MSRs are classified in other assets with changes in the fair value of the securities and the related interest income recorded in mortgage banking income (loss).
The table below presents activity for residential first-lien MSRs for
2011
and
2010
. Commercial and residential reverse MSRs, which are carried at the lower of carrying or market value and accounted for using the amortization method, totaled
$132 million
and
$277 million
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, and are not included in the tables in this Note.
The Corporation uses an OAS valuation approach which factors in prepayment risk to determine the fair value of MSRs. This approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted discount rates.
The significant economic assumptions used in determining the fair value of MSRs at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
are presented below.
The table below presents the sensitivity of the weighted-average lives and fair value of MSRs to changes in modeled assumptions. These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the amounts indicate, changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of MSRs that continue to be held by the Corporation is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities. The below sensitivities do not reflect any hedge strategies that may be undertaken to mitigate such risk.

 Business Segment Information
The Corporation reports the results of its operations through
five
business segments:
Consumer & Business Banking (CBB)
,
Consumer Real Estate Services (CRES), Global Banking, Global Markets
and
Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM),
with the remaining operations recorded in
All Other
. Effective January 1, 2012, the Corporation changed the basis of presentation from
six
to the above
five
segments. The former
Deposits
and
Card Services
segments, as well as Business Banking which was included in the former
Global Commercial Banking
segment, are now reflected in
CBB.
The former
Global Commercial Banking
segment was combined with the Global Corporate and Investment Banking business, which was included in the former
Global Banking & Markets (GBAM)
segment, to form
Global Banking.
The remaining global markets business of
GBAM
is now reported as a separate
Global Markets
segment
.
In addition, certain management accounting methodologies and related allocations were refined. Prior period results have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
Consumer & Business Banking
CBB
offers a diversified range of credit, banking and investment products and services to consumers and businesses.
CBB
product offerings include traditional savings accounts, money market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, noninterest- and interest-bearing checking accounts, investment accounts and products as well as credit and debit cards in the U.S. to consumers and small businesses.
CBB
also offers a wide range of lending-related
 
products and services, integrated working capital management and treasury solutions through a network of offices and client relationship teams along with various product partners to U.S. based companies generally with annual sales of
$1 million
to
$50 million
.
During 2011, the Corporation sold its Canadian consumer card business and is evaluating its remaining international consumer card operations. As a result of these actions, the international consumer card business results were moved to

Basis of Presentation
The management accounting and reporting process derives segment and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies for revenue and expense. The net income derived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the business.
Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to a FTE basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies that are utilized to determine net income. The net interest income of the businesses includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. For presentation purposes, in segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, the Corporation allocates assets to match liabilities. Net interest income of the business segments also includes an allocation of net interest income generated by the Corporations ALM activities.
The Corporations ALM activities include an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts to manage fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporations goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. The majority of the Corporations ALM activities are allocated to the business segments and fluctuate based on performance. ALM activities include external product pricing decisions including deposit pricing strategies, the effects of the Corporations internal funds transfer pricing process and the net effects of other ALM activities.
Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific business segment are allocated to the segments. The most significant of these expenses include data and item processing costs and certain centralized or shared functions. Data processing costs are allocated to the segments based on equipment usage. Item processing costs are allocated to the segments based on the volume of items processed for each segment. The costs of certain centralized or shared functions are allocated based on methodologies that reflect utilization.

Performance by Geographical Area
Since the Corporations operations are highly integrated, certain asset, liability, income and expense amounts must be allocated to arrive at total assets, total revenue, net of interest expense, income (loss) before income taxes and net income (loss) by geographic area. The Corporation identifies its geographic performance based on the business unit structure used to manage the capital or expense deployed in the region as applicable. This requires certain judgments related to the allocation of revenue so that revenue can be appropriately matched with the related expense or capital deployed in the region.
