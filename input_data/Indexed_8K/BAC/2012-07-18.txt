CHARLOTTE  Bank of America Corporation today reported net income of
$2.5 billion
, or
$0.19
per diluted share, for the
second quarter of 2012
, compared to a net loss of
$8.8 billion
, or
$0.90
per diluted share in the second quarter of 2011. The year-ago quarter included a total of $18.2 billion in pretax charges for certain mortgage-related items and other selected adjustments, including provisions for representations and warranties and goodwill impairment.

Relative to the same quarter a year ago, the results for the
second quarter of 2012
reflect higher mortgage banking income, driven largely by lower provisions for representations and warranties, the absence of the goodwill impairment charge and improved credit quality across most major portfolios. In addition, the company had solid contributions from the wealth management and corporate and commercial banking businesses. This was partially offset by lower net interest income from the continued low-rate environment and lower loan levels.
In a challenging global economy, we still see opportunities to do more with our customers and clients. Lending to commercial businesses increased for the sixth straight quarter -- with small business lending and commitments up 23 percent in a year -- and consumer credit is in the best shape in years, said Brian Moynihan, chief executive officer. This quarter we surpassed 10 million mobile banking customers, up 34 percent in a year. With about 45,000 new mobile customers a week, we are adapting to meet customer needs and to do more with them.
Once again, we had strong capital generation this quarter through a combination of earnings growth and a reduction in risk-weighted assets," said Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson. "In one year, our Tier 1 common capital ratios have gone from being the lowest of the major U.S. banks to among the highest, and we've maintained our strong liquidity levels even as we reduced our long-term debt by $125 billion."
As of June 30, 2012, the company's Basel 3 Tier 1 common capital ratio on a fully phased-in basis was estimated at 8.10 percent. This compares with the company's previous guidance of achieving a Basel 3 Tier 1 common capital ratio of more than 7.50 percent on a fully phased-in basis by year-end 2012.
"The fact that we exceeded our previous guidance for Basel 3 six months ahead of schedule points to the significant progress we have made this year to build capital, reduce risk-weighted assets and position the company for long-term growth," Thompson added.

Business Segment Results
The company reports results through five business segments: Consumer and Business Banking (CBB), Consumer Real Estate Services (CRES), Global Banking, Global Markets, and Global Wealth and Investment Management (GWIM), with the remaining operations recorded in All Other.
Consumer and Business Banking
Business Highlights
 
Financial Overview
 
Consumer and Business Banking reported net income of
$1.2 billion
, down
$1.3 billion
from the year-ago quarter, due to lower revenue and higher credit costs.
 
Page
7
Revenue of
$7.3 billion
decreased
$1.4 billion
from the year-ago quarter. Net interest income of
$4.7 billion
decreased
$845 million
primarily from lower average loans and the continued low rate environment.
Noninterest income declined
$510 million
to
$2.6 billion
, primarily from the implementation of debit card interchange fee rules as a result of the Durbin Amendment and a gain on the sale of certain portfolios in the
second quarter of 2011
.
Provision for credit losses, primarily within the Card Services business,
increased
$731 million
from the year-ago quarter to
$1.1 billion
as portfolio trends began to stabilize. Net charge-offs declined to $1.7 billion in the second quarter of 2012 from $2.6 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Noninterest expense of
$4.4 billion
remained relatively flat from the year-ago quarter as lower operating expenses were offset by an increase in litigation expense.
Consumer Real Estate Services
Business Highlights
 
Page
8
Financial Overview
 
Consumer Real Estate Services reported a net loss of
$768 million
for the
second quarter of 2012
, compared to a net loss of
$14.5 billion
for the same period in 2011. The improvement was due primarily to higher mortgage-related charges in the prior year period, including
$14.0 billion
in representations and warranties provision, a
$2.6 billion
non-cash goodwill impairment charge and $2.6 billion in other mortgage-related costs.
While the home loan production businesses remained profitable, the continued high costs of managing delinquent and defaulted loans in the servicing portfolio combined with the costs associated with managing other legacy mortgage exposures resulted in the overall net loss for CRES for the quarter.
Revenue
increased
$13.8 billion
from the
second quarter of 2011
to
$2.5 billion
in the
second quarter of 2012
, driven by higher mortgage banking income, partially offset by lower insurance income due to the sale of Balboa Insurance in mid-2011. Both revenue and mortgage banking income increased from the year-ago quarter due to lower representations and warranties provision and higher servicing income, driven by more favorable MSR results, net of hedges.
While CRES loan fundings declined by
62 percent
compared to the same period in 2011, largely due to the exit from the correspondent channel in late 2011, core production revenue increased slightly due to the higher margins on direct originations.
Representations and warranties provision was
$395 million
in the
second quarter of 2012
, compared to
$14.0 billion
in the
second quarter of 2011
. In the year-ago period, the company recorded $8.6 billion in provision and other expenses related to the agreement to resolve nearly all of the legacy Countrywide-issued first-lien non-GSE RMBS repurchase exposures, and $5.4 billion in provision related to other non-GSE, and to a lesser extent, GSE exposures.
The provision for credit losses in the
second quarter of 2012
decreased
$1.3 billion
from the year-ago quarter to
$186 million
, driven by improved portfolio trends.
Noninterest expense, excluding the $2.6 billion non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of 2011,
decreased
41 percent
to
$3.6 billion
, primarily due to lower litigation expense and mortgage-related assessments, waivers and other similar costs associated with foreclosure delays, as well as lower direct production expenses due to lower volume and the exit from correspondent lending. These declines were partially offset by higher default related servicing expenses.

Global Banking
Business Highlights
 
 
Financial Overview
 
Global Banking
reported net income
of
$1.4 billion
, down
$515 million
from the year-ago quarter, from lower revenues and provision expense benefit partially offset by a decline in noninterest expense. Revenue of
$4.3 billion
was down
8 percent
from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to lower investment banking fees, the lower rate environment and accretion on certain acquired portfolios.
Global Corporate Banking revenue increased to $1.5 billion in the second quarter of 2012 from $1.4 billion in the year-ago quarter, while Global Commercial Banking revenue declined to $2.0 billion in the second quarter of 2012 from $2.3 billion in the second quarter of 2011. Business Lending revenue was $2.0 billion in the second quarter of 2012, down from $2.2 billion in the year-ago quarter. Treasury Services revenue was $1.5 billion in the second quarter of 2012, compared to $1.6 billion in the second quarter of 2011. Firmwide investment banking fees, including self-led deals, declined to
$1.2 billion
from
$1.7 billion
in the year-ago quarter, mainly due to lower underwriting fee revenue.
Page
10
The provision for credit losses was a benefit of
$113 million
in the
second quarter of 2012
, compared to a benefit of
$557 million
in the prior-year quarter. Asset quality continued to improve across all major portfolios with declines in reservable criticized loan balances. Noninterest expense was
$2.2 billion
, down
3 percent
from the year-ago quarter, primarily from lower personnel expense.
Average loans and leases
increased
$7.7 billion
, or
3 percent
from the year-ago quarter, due to growth in domestic and international commercial and industrial loans and international trade finance. Average deposits
increased
$3.4 billion
from the prior-year quarter as balances continued to grow from excess market liquidity and limited alternative investment options.
Global Markets
  
Business Highlights
  
Financial Overview
Global Markets revenue declined
$1.0 billion
from the year-ago quarter to
$3.4 billion
due to lower trading volumes, new issuance activity and client flows. The current quarter included DVA losses of
$156 million
, compared to gains of $123 million in the year-ago quarter.
Net income was
$462 million
in the
second quarter of 2012
, compared with net income of
$911 million
in the year-ago quarter. Noninterest expense of
$2.7 billion
was
$552 million
lower than the year-ago quarter primarily driven by a decrease in personnel-related expense.
Page
11
Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities sales and trading revenue, excluding DVA, was $2.6 billion in the second quarter of 2012, flat from the year-ago quarter and $1.6 billion lower than the first quarter of 2012. Market uncertainty stemming from the eurozone crisis and slower economic growth contributed to a decline in trading volumes and a lower appetite for risk among investors. Equities sales and trading revenue was
$759 million
, a decline of
$318 million
from the year-ago quarter. Volumes remained at low levels impacting trading and commission revenues
.
Global Wealth and Investment Management
Business Highlights
 
Page
12
Financial Overview
 
Net income for Global Wealth and Investment Management rose
6 percent
from the year-ago quarter to
$543 million
as lower revenue was more than offset by decreases in noninterest expense and lower provision for credit losses. Revenue declined
4 percent
to
$4.3 billion
largely as a result of lower net interest income, primarily from the continued low rate environment, and lower transactional activity.
 
Noninterest expense
decreased
6 percent
from the year-ago quarter to
$3.4 billion
, due to lower FDIC expense and other volume-driven expenses as well as lower litigation and legal costs. The provision for credit losses
decreased
$25 million
to
$47 million
from the year-ago quarter due to
improving portfolio trends within the residential mortgage portfolio.
Assets under management (AUM) rose
$21.2 billion
to
$682.2 billion
from the year-ago quarter, driven by long-term AUM flows, while period-end loan balances were up
$2.5 billion
from the year-ago quarter to
$105.4 billion
.
All Other
 
1
 
All Other reported a net loss of
$336 million
in the
second quarter of 2012
, compared to a net loss of
$167 million
for the same period a year ago, as a decline in revenue was partially offset by lower provision for credit losses.
Equity investment income results reflected a loss of
$63 million
in the
second quarter of 2012
, compared to income of
$1.1 billion
in the year-ago quarter, as the year-ago quarter included dividends and gains on sales of certain equity investments. Gains on the sale of debt securities totaled
$354 million
in the
second quarter of 2012
, down from
$831 million
in the same period a year ago.
The second quarter of 2012 also included
$505 million
of net gains resulting from the repurchase of certain debt and trust-preferred securities and negative fair value adjustments on structured liabilities of
$62 million
, compared to positive fair value adjustments of
$214 million
in the
second quarter of 2011
. The first quarter of 2012 included negative fair value adjustments of $3.3 billion.
Page
13
The decrease in the provision for credit losses was driven primarily by continued improvement in credit quality in the residential mortgage portfolio as well as a lower provision related to the Countrywide-purchased credit-impaired discontinued real estate and residential mortgage portfolios.
Corporate Overview
Revenue and Expense
Revenue, net of interest expense, on an FTE basis
rose
$8.7 billion
, or
65 percent
, from the
second quarter of 2011
, driven largely by
$14.0 billion
of representations and warranties provision recorded in the year-ago quarter, partially offset by lower net interest income compared with the year-ago quarter.
Net interest income on an FTE basis
decreased
15 percent
from the year-ago quarter. The net interest yield fell
29
basis points from the year-ago quarter. These decreases were primarily driven by lower consumer loan balances and yields and decreased investment securities yields, partially offset by ongoing reductions in long-term debt balances. Net interest income for the second quarter of 2012 included unfavorable market-related impacts of premium amortization of $319 million and hedge ineffectiveness of $182 million.
Noninterest income
increased
$10.4 billion
from the year-ago quarter, driven largely by a significant reduction in the provision for representations and warranties, partially offset by lower other income in the second quarter of 2012. The year-ago quarter included
$14.0 billion
in representations and warranties provision and a net gain on the sale of Balboa's lender-placed insurance business of $752 million.
Noninterest expense
decreased
$5.8 billion
, or
25 percent
from the year-ago quarter, to
$17.0 billion
. This was primarily due to a $2.6 billion non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge recorded in the year-ago quarter, lower litigation expense and a reduction in mortgage-related assessments, waivers and similar costs related to delayed foreclosures. Litigation expense was $963 million in the
second quarter of 2012
, compared to $2.2 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Page
14
Income tax expense for the
second quarter of 2012
was
$684 million
, resulting in a
22 percent
effective tax rate. This compares to an income tax benefit of $4.0 billion on a
$12.9 billion
pretax loss in the year-ago quarter.
Credit Quality
Note: Ratios do not include loans measured under the fair value option.
  
Credit quality continued to improve in the
second quarter of 2012
, with net charge-offs declining across most major portfolios and the provision for credit losses decreasing significantly, compared to the
second quarter of 2011
. Additionally, 30+ day performing delinquent loans, excluding fully-insured loans, declined across most major portfolios, and reservable criticized balances also continued to decline, down 42 percent from the year-ago period.
Net charge-offs of
$3.6 billion
for the
second quarter of 2012
declined
$430 million
from the
first quarter of 2012
and
$2.0 billion
from the
second quarter of 2011
. The improvement compared to both prior periods was impacted by the Card Services portfolios within CBB due to fewer delinquent loans. Also impacting the improvement from the year-ago period were lower bankruptcy filings. In addition, net charge-offs declined in the consumer real estate portfolios from both the first quarter of 2012 and the year-ago quarter, driven by fewer delinquent loans and lower refreshed valuation losses on loans greater than 180 days past due.
  
The provision for credit losses declined to
$1.8 billion
in the
second quarter of 2012
from
$2.4 billion
in the
first quarter of 2012
and
$3.3 billion
in the
second quarter of 2011
. The provision for credit losses for the
second quarter of 2012
was
$1.9 billion
lower than net charge-offs, resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit loss. This was driven primarily by reductions in the home equity portfolio primarily due to continued portfolio stabilization, as well as improvement in bankruptcies and delinquencies across the Card Services portfolio within CBB. The reserve reduction was also due to improvement in economic conditions impacting the core commercial portfolio, as evidenced by continued declines in reservable criticized and commercial nonperforming balances.

The allowance for loan and lease losses to annualized net charge-off coverage ratio increased in the
second quarter of 2012
to
2.08
times, compared with
1.97
times in the
first quarter of 2012
and
1.64
times in the
second quarter of 2011
. Excluding purchased credit-impaired loans, the allowance to annualized net charge-off coverage ratio was
1.46
times,
1.43
times and
1.28
times for the same periods, respectively.
Nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were
$25.4 billion
at
June 30, 2012
, a
decrease
from
$27.8 billion
at
March 31, 2012
and
$30.1 billion
at
June 30, 2011
.
Capital and Liquidity Management
The Tier 1 common capital ratio under Basel 1 increased significantly during the second quarter to
11.24 percent
from
10.78 percent
at
March 31, 2012
and
8.23 percent
at
June 30, 2011
. The Tier 1 capital ratio was
13.80 percent
at June 30, 2012. This compares with
13.37 percent
at
March 31, 2012
and
11.00 percent
at
June 30, 2011
.
In late 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision proposed Basel 3 rules with an implementation date of January 2013. U.S. regulators issued proposed rules for Basel 3 and final market risk rules in June 2012. Among other things, Basel 3 would substantially raise minimum capital requirements, change the definition of regulatory capital, introduce new liquidity and coverage ratios and propose a phased implementation of these changes over several years, with full implementation targeted for 2019. 
The company's estimates under Basel 3, do not reflect the proposed U.S. Basel 3 rules, but are based on its current understanding of both the final U.S. market risk rules and BIS Basel 3 guidelines, assuming all relevant regulatory model approvals. These estimates under Basel 3 will evolve over time as the company's businesses change and as a result of further rulemaking or clarification by U.S. regulatory agencies. The final U.S. market risk rules and BIS Basel 3 guidelines require approval by banking regulators of certain models used as part of risk-weighted asset calculations. If these models are not approved, the company's capital ratio would likely be adversely impacted, which in some cases could be significant. In addition to Basel 1 requirements and capital ratios, these estimates assist management, investors and analysts in assessing capital adequacy and comparability under Basel 3 capital standards to other financial services companies. The company continues to evaluate the potential impact of proposed rules and anticipates it will be in compliance with any final rules by the proposed effective dates.
As of June 30, 2012, the company's Tier 1 common capital ratio on a Basel 3 fully phased-in basis was estimated at 8.10 percent.

At June 30, 2012, the company's total Global Excess Liquidity Sources were $378 billion, down only $28 billion from the first quarter of 2012 even as the company reduced long-term debt by
$53 billion
. On June 30, 2011, Global Excess Liquidity Sources were $402 billion. Time-to-required funding increased to a record 37 months at
June 30, 2012
from 31 months at
March 31, 2012
and 22 months at
June 30, 2011
.
During the
second quarter of 2012
, a cash dividend of
$0.01
per common share was paid and the company recorded
$365 million
in preferred dividends. Period-end common shares issued and outstanding were
10.78 billion
and
10.13 billion
for the
second quarter of 2012
and
2011
, respectively.

The Corporation evaluates its business based on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP financial measure. The Corporation believes managing the business with net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and noninterest income. The Corporation views related ratios and analyses (i.e., efficiency ratios and net interest yield) on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. To derive the fully taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield evaluates the basis points the Corporation earns over the cost of funds.
The Corporation also evaluates its business based on the following ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on average tangible common shareholders equity measures the Corporations earnings contribution as a percentage of average common shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders equity measures the Corporations earnings contribution as a percentage of average shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible common equity ratio represents ending common shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible equity ratio represents total ending shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents ending common shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporations use of equity (i.e., capital). In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals.
In addition, the Corporation evaluates its business segment results based on return on average economic capital, a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on average economic capital for the segments is calculated as net income adjusted for cost of funds and earnings credits and certain expenses related to intangibles, divided by average economic capital. Economic capital represents average allocated equity less goodwill and a percentage of intangible assets. It also believes the use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides additional clarity in assessing the segments.
In certain presentations, earnings and diluted earnings per common share, the efficiency ratio, return on average assets, return on common shareholders equity, return on average tangible common shareholders equity and return on average tangible shareholders equity are calculated excluding the impact of a goodwill impairment charge of
$2.6 billion
recorded in the second quarter of 2011. Accordingly, these are non-GAAP financial measures.

Representations and Warranties 1  FNMAs repurchase requests, standards for rescission of repurchase requests and resolution processes continue to be inconsistent with their own past conduct and our interpretation of our contractual obligations. These developments have resulted in an increase in claims outstanding from the GSEs. (We remain in disagreement with FNMA over claims submitted.)  At June 30, 2012, $7.9B of the outstanding claims submitted by GSEs relate to loans on which the borrowers have made at least 25 payments compared to $3.7B at December 31, 2011  Due to the significant uncertainty related to our continued differences with the GSEs concerning each party's interpretation of the requirements of the governing contracts, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the outcome or range of possible loss may be. Refer to pages 46 and 47 of Bank of Americas March 31, 2012 10Q on file with SEC for additional disclosures.  Increases in private-label new claims are primarily related to repurchase requests received from trustees on private- label securitization transactions not included in the BNY Mellon settlement, including claims related to third-party sponsored securitizations that include monoline insurance  Estimated range of possible loss related to non-GSE representations and warranties exposure of up to $5B over existing accruals at June 30, 2012 2Q11 3Q11 4Q11 1Q12 2Q12 GSEs $5,081 $4,721 $6,258 $8,103 $10,974 Private 1,782 2,229 3,267 4,855 8,603 Monolines 3,052 3,058 3,082 3,136 3,128 Total $9,915 $10,008 $12,607 $16,094 $22,705 Outstanding Claims by Counterparty ($MM) Liability for Representations and Warranties ($MM) 2Q11 3Q11 4Q11 1Q12 2Q12 Beginning Balance $6,220 $17,780 $16,271 $15,858 $15,746 Additions for new sales 3 3 7 5 7 Provision 14,037 278 263 282 395 Charge-offs (2,480) (1,790) (683) (399) (205) Ending Balance $17,780 $16,271 $15,858 $15,746 $15,943 ____________________ 1 In addition to the claims in these tables, we have received repurchase demands from private-label securitization investors and a master servicer where we believe the claimant has not satisfied the contractual thresholds to direct the securitization trustee to take action and/or that these demands are otherwise procedurally or substantively invalid. The amounts outstanding of total demands were $3.1B as of both June 30, 2012 and March 31, 2012 and $1.7B as of December 31, 2011, September 30, 2011, and June 30, 2011. $1.7B of these demands relate to loans underlying securitizations included in the settlement with BNY Mellon, as trustee.

Bank of America 2Q12 Financial Results July 18, 2012
 
Bank of America and its management may make certain statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as anticipates, targets, expects, hopes, estimates, intends, plans, goals, believes, continue and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will, should, would and could. The forward-looking statements made in this presentation represent Bank of America's current expectations, plans or forecasts of its future results and revenues and include statements that the Company will not issue any long-term, unsecured parent company plain vanilla debt absent compelling market conditions; maturities of $23 billion in the second half of the year will reduce the long-term debt balance and associated interest expense; an increase in rates from the end of June would have a positive impact while a decrease would have a negative impact; quarterly net interest income is estimated to start at a base of $10.3 billion before the impact from liability management actions; second quarter parent debt maturities and liability management actions plus the third quarter announced redemptions and calls will reduce quarterly interest expense by approximately $300 million; 60+ days delinquent firsts can be reduced by approximately 300K over the next 12 months; another U.K. tax rate reduction of two percent will be enacted in the third quarter, which should result in a tax charge at that time of about $800 million, and due to the deferred tax asset disallowance that charge will not impact the Companys Tier 1 capital ratios; the tax rate will be 22 percent for the rest of the year except for unusual items that may come up; the expectation that Project New BAC Phase 2 expense reductions will reach approximately $3 billion on an annualized basis and will be fully phased in by the first half of 2015; the Company is on track to exceed 20 percent of the $5 billion savings this year; both Phase 1 and Phase 2 will produce lower FTE head count and annualized cost savings of approximately $8 billion by the first half of 2015 and are expected to eliminate 18 and 11 percent, respectively, of beginning cost base of targeted areas; reserve reductions will continue throughout the remainder of 2012, although at significantly reduced levels; provision expense for the next two quarters will be closer to first quarter results versus second quarter results; outstanding claims from the GSEs as a result of ongoing disagreements with Fannie Mae will continue to grow as the process for ultimate resolution continues to evolve; the agreement reached with a monoline will reduce outstanding monoline claims at the end of June by approximately 20 percent; non-government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) range of possible loss over and above existing reserve levels up to $5 billion; Basel 3 Tier 1 common capital ratio estimates will evolve over time along with Basel 3 rules and changes in businesses and economic conditions will impact these estimates; the Company will continue to evaluate the potential impact of the proposed rules and anticipates it will be in compliance with any final rules by the proposed effective dates; the Company will repurchase loans to the extent required under the contracts and standards that govern relationships with the GSEs; demands related to loans underlying securitizations included in the settlement with BNY Mellon as trustee will be resolved by the settlement if approved by the court; the Companys expectation that it will bring down long-term debt both by maturities and active liability management; and other similar matters. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond Bank of America's control.

 The information contained herein is preliminary and based on company data available at the time of the earnings presentation. It speaks only as of the particular date or dates included in the accompanying slides. Bank of America does not undertake an obligation to, and disclaims any duty to, update any of the information provided  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation  The Companys estimates under Basel 3, do not reflect the recently proposed U.S. Basel 3 rules, but are based on its current understanding of both the final U.S. market risk rules and BIS Basel 3 guidelines, assuming all relevant regulatory model approvals. These estimates under Basel 3 will evolve over time as the Companys businesses change and as a result of further rulemaking or clarification by U.S. regulatory agencies. The final U.S. market risk rules and BIS Basel 3 guidelines require approval by banking regulators of certain models used as part of risk- weighted asset calculations. If these models are not approved, the Companys capital ratio would likely be adversely impacted , which in some cases could be significant. In addition to Basel 1 requirements and capital ratios, these estimates assist management, investors and analysts in assessing capital adequacy and comparability under Basel 3 capital standards to other financial services companies. The Company continues to evaluate the potential impact of proposed rules and anticipates it will be in compliance with any final rules by the proposed effective dates  Certain financial measures contained herein represent non-GAAP financial measures. For more information about the non-GAAP financial measures contained herein, please see the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and accompanying reconciliations in the earnings press release and other earnings-related information available through the Bank of America Investor Relations web site at: http://investor.bankofamerica.com 3 Important Presentation Information

Representations and Warranties 1 16  FNMAs repurchase requests, standards for rescission of repurchase requests and resolution processes continue to be inconsistent with their own past conduct and our interpretation of our contractual obligations. These developments have resulted in an increase in claims outstanding from the GSEs. (We remain in disagreement with FNMA over claims submitted.)  At June 30, 2012, $7.9B of the outstanding claims submitted by GSEs relate to loans on which the borrowers have made at least 25 payments compared to $3.7B at December 31, 2011  Due to the significant uncertainty related to our continued differences with the GSEs concerning each party's interpretation of the requirements of the governing contracts, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the outcome or range of possible loss may be. Refer to pages 46 and 47 of Bank of Americas March 31, 2012 10Q on file with SEC for additional disclosures.  Increases in private-label new claims are primarily related to repurchase requests received from trustees on private- label securitization transactions not included in the BNY Mellon settlement, including claims related to third-party sponsored securitizations that include monoline insurance  Estimated range of possible loss related to non-GSE representations and warranties exposure of up to $5B over existing accruals at June 30, 2012 2Q11 3Q11 4Q11 1Q12 2Q12 GSEs $5,081 $4,721 $6,258 $8,103 $10,974 Private 1,782 2,229 3,267 4,855 8,603 Monolines 3,052 3,058 3,082 3,136 3,128 Total $9,915 $10,008 $12,607 $16,094 $22,705 Outstanding Claims by Counterparty ($MM) Liability for Representations and Warranties ($MM) 2Q11 3Q11 4Q11 1Q12 2Q12 Beginning Balance $6,220 $17,780 $16,271 $15,858 $15,746 Additions for new sales 3 3 7 5 7 Provision 14,037 278 263 282 395 Charge-offs (2,480) (1,790) (683) (399) (205) Ending Balance $17,780 $16,271 $15,858 $15,746 $15,943 ____________________ 1 In addition to the claims in these tables, we have received repurchase demands from private-label securitization investors and a master servicer where we believe the claimant has not satisfied the contractual thresholds to direct the securitization trustee to take action and/or that these demands are otherwise procedurally or substantively invalid. The amounts outstanding of total demands were $3.1B as of both June 30, 2012 and March 31, 2012 and $1.7B as of December 31, 2011, September 30, 2011, and June 30, 2011. $1.7B of these demands relate to loans underlying securitizations included in the settlement with BNY Mellon, as trustee. A claimant has filed litigation against us relating to $1.4B of such demands. If the BNY Mellon settlement is approved by the court, demands related to loans underlying securitizations included in the settlement with BNY Mellon, as trustee will be resolved by the settlement.
