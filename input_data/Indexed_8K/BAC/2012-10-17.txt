Bank of America Reports Third-Quarter 2012 Net Income of $340 Million, or $0.00 per Share
Previously Announced Items Negatively Impact Earnings

CHARLOTTE  Bank of America Corporation today reported net income of
$340 million
, or
$0.00
per diluted share, for the
third quarter of 2012
, compared to
$6.2 billion
, or
$0.56
per diluted share, in the
third quarter of 2011
.
As previously reported, the third quarter of 2012 was negatively impacted by $1.9 billion of debit valuation adjustments (DVA) and fair value option (FVO) adjustments related to the improvement in the company's credit spreads, $1.6 billion for total litigation expense, including a charge for the previously announced settlement of the Merrill Lynch class action litigation, and a charge of $0.8 billion related to the repricing of certain deferred tax assets due to a reduction in the U.K. corporate tax rate. Together, these three items totaled a negative $0.28 per share.
The year-ago quarter included $6.2 billion in positive DVA and FVO adjustments, $0.6 billion in total litigation expense and $0.8 billion related to the repricing of certain deferred tax assets due to a reduction in the U.K. corporate tax rate. Together, these three items totaled a positive $0.27 per share in the third quarter of 2011. In addition, the year-ago quarter included, among other significant items, a $3.6 billion pretax gain on the sale of a portion of the company's investment in China Construction Bank (CCB), partially offset by $2.2 billion of net losses related to equity and strategic investments other than CCB.
Relative to the year-ago quarter, the results for the
third quarter of 2012
were driven by improved credit quality across most major portfolios, increased sales and trading revenue (excluding impact of DVA), higher mortgage banking income and increased investment banking income.
"We are doing more business with our customers and clients:  Deposits are up; mortgage originations are up; we surpassed 11 million in mobile customers; small business lending is up 27 percent year over year; loans to our commercial clients rose for the seventh consecutive quarter; and our corporate clients made us the second-ranked global investment banking firm," said Brian Moynihan, chief executive officer. "Our strategy is taking hold even as we work through a challenging economy and continue to clean up legacy issues."
"Our focus on strengthening the balance sheet continued this quarter," said Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson. "We ended the quarter with record Tier 1 common capital ratio of 11.41 percent and an estimated Basel 3 Tier 1 common capital ratio of 8.97 percent, up from 7.95 percent as of the second quarter of 2012
1
. With these gains, we have turned our attention to driving core earnings."

Business Segment Results
The company reports results through five business segments: Consumer and Business Banking (CBB), Consumer Real Estate Services (CRES), Global Wealth and Investment Management (GWIM), Global Banking and Global Markets, with the remaining operations recorded in All Other.
Consumer and Business Banking
Business Highlights
 
Financial Overview
 
Consumer and Business Banking reported net income of
$1.3 billion
, down
$379 million
from the year-ago quarter, due to lower revenue partially offset by lower noninterest expense and credit costs.
 
Page
7
Revenue decreased by $1.1 billion from the year-ago quarter to
$7.1 billion
, primarily from the implementation of debit card interchange fee rules in October 2011 as a result of the Durbin Amendment, lower average loan balances, the continued low-rate environment and the negative impact of the company's consumer protection products
.
Provision for credit losses
decreased
$162 million
, primarily within the Card Services business, from the year-ago quarter to
$970 million
due to improvement in delinquencies and bankruptcies. Noninterest expense
decreased
$286 million
to
$4.1 billion
compared to the
third quarter of 2011
as a result of lower FDIC expense and lower operating expenses.
Consumer Real Estate Services
Business Highlights
 
Financial Overview
 
Consumer Real Estate Services reported a net loss of
$877 million
for the
third quarter of 2012
, compared to a net loss of
$1.1 billion
for the same period in 2011. The improvement was due primarily to higher mortgage banking income and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher expenses.
While the Home Loans business was profitable in the quarter, the continued high costs of managing delinquent and defaulted loans in the servicing portfolio combined with the costs associated with managing other legacy mortgage exposures resulted in the overall net loss for CRES for the quarter.
Page
8
Revenue
increased
$274 million
from the
third quarter of 2011
to
$3.1 billion
in the
third quarter of 2012
, driven by higher mortgage banking income and other noninterest income, partially offset by lower net interest income. Mortgage banking income increased from the year-ago quarter due to more favorable MSR results, net of hedges, and higher production income.
While loan fundings declined by $12.6 billion compared to the same period in 2011, largely due to the exit from the correspondent channel in late 2011, core production revenue increased by $139 million from the year-ago quarter primarily due to higher margins on a increased volume of direct originations.
Representations and warranties provision was
$307 million
in the
third quarter of 2012
, compared to $395 million in the second quarter of 2012 and
$278 million
in the
third quarter of 2011
.
The provision for credit losses in the
third quarter of 2012
decreased
$654 million
from the year-ago quarter to
$264 million
, driven by improved portfolio trends in the non-purchased credit-impaired (PCI) portfolio and reserve reductions in the PCI home equity portfolio partially offset by the impact of new regulatory guidance for loans discharged in bankruptcies.
Noninterest expense
increased
from the
third quarter of 2011
to
$4.2 billion
, primarily due to higher default-related servicing expenses and litigation expense. This was partially offset by lower production expenses and a reduction in mortgage-related assessments, waivers and other similar costs associated with foreclosure delays.

Global Wealth and Investment Management
Business Highlights
 
Financial Overview
 
Net income for GWIM rose
50 percent
from the
third quarter of 2011
to
$542 million
due to lower expenses and credit costs and higher revenue. Revenue
increased
1 percent
to
$4.3 billion
largely as a result of higher net interest income.
 
Noninterest expense
decreased
4 percent from the
third quarter of 2011
to
$3.4 billion
due to lower FDIC expense and lower support and personnel costs. The provision for credit losses
decreased
$101 million
from the
third quarter of 2011
to
$61 million
due to lower delinquencies and improving portfolio trends within the residential mortgage portfolio.
Page
10
Assets under management rose
$90.9 billion
from the
third quarter of 2011
to
$707.8 billion
, driven by higher market levels and long-term AUM flows.
Global Banking
Business Highlights
 
 
Financial Overview
 
Global Banking
reported net income
of
$1.3 billion
,
up
$89 million
from the year-ago quarter, as higher revenue and a decline in noninterest expense were partially offset by an increase in provision expense. Revenue of
$4.1 billion
was
up
5 percent
from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to gains on the fair value option loan book in the most recent quarter.
In the
third quarter of 2012
, Global Corporate Banking revenue was
$1.4 billion
and Global Commercial Banking revenue was
$2.0 billion
, both relatively unchanged compared to the year-ago quarter. In the third quarter of 2012, Business Lending revenue was
$1.9 billion
and Treasury Services revenue was
$1.5 billion
, both also relatively unchanged compared
Page
11
to the
third quarter of 2011
. Firmwide investment banking fees, excluding self-led deals, increased 42 percent to $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2012 from $942 million in the year-ago quarter, mainly due to a strong performance in capital markets underwriting activity.
The provision for credit losses was
$68 million
in the
third quarter of 2012
, compared to a benefit of
$182 million
in the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by lower reserve releases as asset quality stabilizes in the portfolio. Noninterest expense was
$2.0 billion
, down
9 percent
from the year-ago quarter, primarily from lower personnel expense and operational costs.
Global Markets

Business Highlights
Page
12
Financial Overview
Global Markets reported a net loss in the
third quarter of 2012
of
$359 million
, compared to a net loss of
$553 million
in the year-ago quarter. Excluding DVA losses and the impact of the U.K. tax change, net income was $789 million in the third quarter of 2012, compared to net income of $560 million in the second quarter of 2012 and a net loss of $856 million in the year-ago quarter. The improvement from the third quarter of 2011 was driven by higher sales and trading revenue and an increase in new issuance activity.
Global Markets revenue declined
$188 million
from the year-ago quarter to
$3.1 billion
. However, excluding DVA, revenue increased
$2.1 billion
to $3.7 billion, reflecting solid performance as credit markets improved and volatility declined compared to the difficult market environment in the year-ago period. The current quarter included DVA losses of
$582 million
, compared to DVA gains of
$1.7 billion
in the year-ago quarter.
Noninterest expense declined to
$2.5 billion
from $3.0 billion in the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by a decrease in personnel-related expense and operational costs. Income tax expense for the most recent period included a $0.8 billion charge related to the repricing of certain deferred tax assets due to a reduction in the U.K. corporate tax rate. This compares to a $0.8 billion charge in the year-ago quarter.
Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities sales and trading revenue, excluding DVA
5
, was $2.5 billion in the third quarter of 2012, an increase of $2.0 billion from the year-ago quarter. Quantitative easing, spread tightening and improved mortgage markets contributed to a solid quarter. Equities sales and trading revenue, excluding DVA, was $712 million, a decline of $41 million from the year-ago quarter as volumes remained at low levels impacting commission revenue.
All Other
 
1
 
All Other reported a net loss of
$1.5 billion
in the
third quarter of 2012
, compared to net income of
$4.7 billion
for the same period a year ago, primarily due to
$1.3 billion
in negative FVO adjustments on structured liabilities related to the improvement in the company's credit spreads, compared to positive FVO adjustments of
$4.5 billion
in the
third quarter of 2011
. Equity investment income was
$165 million
in the
third quarter of 2012
, compared to
$1.4 billion
in the year-ago quarter, which included a $3.6 billion gain on the sale of a portion of the company's investment in CCB partially offset by $2.2 billion of net
Page
13
losses related to equity and strategic investments other than CCB. Gains on the sale of debt securities totaled
$327 million
in the
third quarter of 2012
, down from
$697 million
in the same period a year ago.
The decrease in the provision for credit losses was driven primarily by continued improvement in credit quality in the residential mortgage portfolio as well as the sale of the Canadian consumer credit card portfolio in 2011 and improvement in remaining non-U.S. credit card delinquencies. Noninterest expense increased compared to the
third quarter of 2011
as a result of higher litigation expense primarily related to the costs associated with the previously announced Merrill Lynch class action settlement and other litigation. Excluding litigation, noninterest expense decreased compared to the
third quarter of 2011
.
Corporate Overview
Revenue and Expense
Revenue, net of interest expense, on an FTE basis,
fell
$8.0 billion
, or
28 percent
, from the
third quarter of 2011
, driven largely by negative FVO adjustments and net DVA losses. Excluding the impact of DVA and FVO adjustments, revenue, net of interest expense, on an FTE basis, was $22.5 billion in the third quarter of 2012, $22.4 billion in the second quarter of 2012 and $22.5 billion in the third quarter of 2011.
Net interest income, on an FTE basis
decreased
5 percent
from the year-ago quarter, as lower consumer loan balances were partially offset by ongoing reductions in long-term debt balances and lower rates paid on deposits. Net interest income for the
third quarter of 2012
also included unfavorable market-related impacts of premium amortization of $269 million and hedge ineffectiveness of $55 million down from $319 million and $182 million in the second quarter of 2012. Relative to the second quarter of 2012, net interest income increased 4 percent.
Noninterest income
decreased
$7.5 billion
from the year-ago quarter, driven largely by
Page
14
negative DVA and FVO adjustments and lower equity investment income. FVO adjustments were a negative
$1.3 billion
in the
third quarter of 2012
, compared to a positive
$4.5 billion
in the
third quarter of 2011
, and net DVA losses were
$583 million
, compared to net DVA gains of
$1.7 billion
in the year-ago period. Equity income was down
$1.2 billion
from the
third quarter of 2011
as the year-ago period included net gains related to equity and strategic investments.
Noninterest expense was relatively flat compared to the year-ago quarter, as an increase in other general operating expense primarily related to the costs associated with the previously announced Merrill Lynch class action settlement and other litigation were offset by a decrease in personnel expense as the company continued to streamline processes and achieve cost savings. Litigation expense was $1.6 billion in the
third quarter of 2012
, compared to $963 million in the second quarter of 2012 and $566 million in the third quarter of 2011.
Income tax expense for the
third quarter of 2012
was
$770 million
, resulting in a
69 percent
effective tax rate. This compares to income tax expense of
$1.2 billion
on
$7.4 billion
of pretax income resulting in a
16 percent
effective tax rate in the year-ago quarter. The three months ended
September 30, 2012
included a $0.8 billion charge to income tax expense for the remeasurement of certain U.K. deferred tax assets.
Credit Quality
Note: Ratios do not include loans measured under the fair value option.
  
Credit quality continued to improve in the
third quarter of 2012
, with net charge-offs declining across nearly all major portfolios and the provision for credit losses decreasing significantly compared to the
third quarter of 2011
. Additionally, 30+ days performing delinquent loans, excluding fully-insured loans, declined across all major portfolios, and
Page
15
reservable criticized balances also continued to decline, down 44 percent from the year-ago period.
Net charge-offs of
$4.1 billion
in the
third quarter of 2012
increased
$496 million
from the
second quarter of 2012
and
declined
$964 million
from the
third quarter of 2011
. Included in the current period results were charge-offs of $435 million related to extinguishment of loans in connection with the National Mortgage Settlement and $478 million due to a change in treatment of loans discharged in bankruptcy, as a result of new regulatory guidance stating that such loans should be written down to collateral value irrespective of borrower payment status. Excluding these items, charge-offs improved from both prior periods, driven by fewer delinquent loans and bankruptcy filings in the Card Services portfolios. In addition, net charge-offs declined in the consumer real estate portfolios, driven by fewer delinquent loans and lower refreshed valuation losses on loans greater than 180 days past due. The improvement from a year ago was also impacted by lower net charge-offs in the core commercial portfolio.
The provision for credit losses was
$1.8 billion
in both the third and second quarters of 2012 and
$3.4 billion
in the
third quarter of 2011
. The provision for credit losses in the
third quarter of 2012
was
$2.3 billion
lower than net charge-offs, resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses. This included the utilization of $435 million of reserves on the loans extinguished as a part of the National Mortgage Settlement and a $166 million benefit in the PCI portfolio due to an improved home price outlook. The remaining reduction in the allowance was driven by the consumer real estate portfolios primarily due to improved home prices and continued portfolio stabilization, as well as improvement in bankruptcies and delinquencies across the Card Services portfolio.
The allowance for loan and lease losses to annualized net charge-off coverage ratio was
1.60
times in the
third quarter of 2012
, compared with
2.08
times in the
second quarter of 2012
and
1.74
times in the
third quarter of 2011
. The decline in coverage was due to increased current-period charge-offs in connection with the National Mortgage Settlement and the change in the treatment of loans discharged in bankruptcy noted above, as well as a $1.7 billion reduction in the PCI allowance due primarily to the extinguishment of home equity loans in connection with the National Mortgage Settlement that were already fully reserved.
The following shows the allowance to annualized net charge-off coverage ratios for the third quarter of 2012 and the effect of the National Mortgage Settlement and the change in the treatment of loans discharged in bankruptcy as noted above, compared to the second quarter of 2012 and the third quarter of 2011.

Nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were
$24.6 billion
at
September 30, 2012
, a decrease from
$25.4 billion
at
June 30, 2012
and
$29.1 billion
at
September 30, 2011
. The September 30, 2012 balance included $1.1 billion related to the change in treatment of loans discharged in bankruptcies in accordance with new regulatory guidance, which states that such loans must be classified as nonperforming, irrespective of the delinquency status or payment history.
Capital and Liquidity Management
The Tier 1 common capital ratio under Basel 1 increased during the third quarter to
11.41 percent
from
11.24 percent
at
June 30, 2012
and
8.65 percent
at
September 30, 2011
. The Tier 1 capital ratio was
13.64 percent
at September 30, 2012. This compares with
13.80 percent
at
June 30, 2012
and
11.48 percent
at
September 30, 2011
.
As of September 30, 2012, the company's Tier 1 common capital ratio on a Basel 3 fully phased-in basis was estimated at 8.97 percent, up from 7.95 percent at June 30, 2012
1
.
 
Basel 3 estimates are based on the company
'
s current understanding of both the final U.S. market risk rules and the U.S. Basel 3 NPRs, assuming all regulatory model approvals.

At
September 30, 2012
, the company's total Global Excess Liquidity Sources were $380 billion, up $2 billion from the
second quarter of 2012
and $17 billion from the
third quarter of 2011
, despite the continued reduction in long-term debt. Long-term debt declined by $15 billion from the prior period and $112 billion from the year-ago period. Time-to-required funding was 35 months at
September 30, 2012
compared to 37 months at
June 30, 2012
and 27 months at
September 30, 2011
.
During the
third quarter of 2012
, a cash dividend of
$0.01
per common share was paid and the company recorded
$373 million
in preferred dividends. Period-end common shares issued and outstanding were
10.78 billion
and
10.13 billion
for the
third quarter of 2012
and
2011
, respectively.

The Corporation evaluates its business based on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP financial measure. The Corporation believes managing the business with net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and noninterest income. The Corporation views related ratios and analyses (i.e., efficiency ratios and net interest yield) on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. To derive the fully taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield evaluates the basis points the Corporation earns over the cost of funds.
The Corporation also evaluates its business based on the following ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on average tangible common shareholders equity measures the Corporations earnings contribution as a percentage of average common shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders equity measures the Corporations earnings contribution as a percentage of average shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible common equity ratio represents ending common shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible equity ratio represents total ending shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents ending common shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporations use of equity (i.e., capital). In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals.
In addition, the Corporation evaluates its business segment results based on return on average economic capital, a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on average economic capital for the segments is calculated as net income adjusted for cost of funds and earnings credits and certain expenses related to intangibles, divided by average economic capital. Economic capital represents average allocated equity less goodwill and a percentage of intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights). It also believes the use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides additional clarity in assessing the segments.
In certain presentations, earnings and diluted earnings per common share, the efficiency ratio, return on average assets, return on common shareholders equity, return on average tangible common shareholders equity and return on average tangible shareholders equity are calculated excluding the impact of a goodwill impairment charge of
$2.6 billion
recorded in the second quarter of 2011. Accordingly, these are non-GAAP financial measures.

October 17, 2012 Bank of America 3Q12 Financial Results
 
Bank of America and its management may make certain statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as anticipates, targets, expects, hopes, estimates, intends, plans, goals, believes, continue and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will, should, would and could. The forward-looking statements made in this presentation represent Bank of America's current expectations, plans or forecasts of its future results and revenues and include statements that the Tier 1 common capital ratio will increase in the event that U.S. regulators assess a countercyclical buffer requirement for any country and that any such assessment will generally be announced twelve months prior to the effective date of the assessment; Basel 1 and Basel 3 capital measures will be impacted by future changes in interest rates and earnings performance; the Company is well positioned for Basel 3; the Company expects net interest income savings due to additional liability management actions announced in early October of approximately $50MM in 2012 and $300MM in 2013, and a loss upon redemption of $100MM in 4Q12; near term outlook for net interest income includes benefits from liability management actions; the Company expects to bring down long- term debt, both by maturities and liability management, consistent with the overall goal of continuing to optimize net interest income; the impact of additional liability management actions and long-term debt maturities are expected to help offset headwinds from continued pressure on consumer loan balances and investment security portfolio re-pricing; the Company is on track to meet its commitments related to extended credit of $6.2B in small business lending; declines in 60+ days delinquent loan trends are expected to continue; total staffing will drop in 4Q12 and expenses will be down as the Company continues to decrease delinquent loans in the servicing portfolio as well as reduce overall servicing costs; 21 percent is estimated to be the tax rate for the rest of the year except for unusual items that may come up; going forward, the Company believes that most products will soon stabilize, overall reserve reductions are expected to continue throughout the remainder of 2012 although at significantly reduced levels, and consequently provision expense in 4Q12 will be higher but not as high as experienced in 1Q12; estimates of liability and range of possible loss for various representations and warranties claims; the Company expects to generate $8B in cost savings via New BAC over the next few years; focus will shift from the fundamentals of capital build and expense reductions toward all areas of core growth; and other similar matters. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond Bank of America's control. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should consider all of the following uncertainties and risks, as well as those more fully discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors of Bank of America's 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in any of Bank of America's subsequent SEC filings: the Company's resolution of differences with the GSEs regarding representations and warranties repurchase claims, including with respect to mortgage insurance rescissions, and foreclosure delays; the Company's ability to resolve representations and warranties claims made by monolines and private-label and other investors, including as a result of any adverse court rulings, and the chance that the Company could face related servicing, securities, fraud, indemnity or other claims from one or more of the monolines or private-label and other investors; if future representations and warranties losses occur in excess of the Companys recorded liability and estimated range of possible loss for GSE and non- GSE exposures; uncertainties about the financial stability of several countries in the European Union (EU), the increasing risk that those countries may default on their sovereign debt or exit the EU, and the related stresses on financial markets, the Euro and the EU and the Companys direct and indirect exposures to such risks; the uncertainty regarding the timing and final substance of any capital or liquidity standards, including the final Basel 3 requirements and their implementation for U.S. banks through rulemaking by the Federal Reserve, including anticipated requirements to hold higher levels of regulatory capital, liquidity and meet higher regulatory capital ratios as a result of final Basel 3 or other capital or liquidity standards; the negative impact of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act on the Companys businesses and earnings, including as a result of additional regulatory interpretation and rulemaking and the success of the Companys actions to mitigate such impacts; the Company's satisfaction of its borrower assistance programs under the global settlement agreement with federal agencies and state attorneys general (National Mortgage Settlement); adverse changes to the Company's credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies; estimates of the fair value of certain of the Companys assets and liabilities; unexpected claims, damages and fines resulting from pending or future litigation and regulatory proceedings; the Companys ability to fully realize the cost savings and other anticipated benefits from Project New BAC, including in accordance with currently anticipated timeframes; and other similar matters. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and Bank of America undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statement was made. 2 Forward-Looking Statements
 
 The information contained herein is preliminary and based on company data available at the time of the earnings presentation. It speaks only as of the particular date or dates included in the accompanying slides. Bank of America does not undertake an obligation to, and disclaims any duty to, update any of the information provided  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation  The Companys estimates under Basel 3 are based on its current understanding of both the final U.S. market risk rules and the U.S. Basel 3 Advanced NPR, assuming all relevant regulatory model approvals. These estimates under Basel 3 will evolve over time as the Companys businesses change and as a result of further rulemaking or clarification by U.S. regulatory agencies. The final U.S. market risk rules and U.S. Basel 3 Advanced NPR require approval by banking regulators of certain models used as part of risk-weighted asset calculations. If these models are not approved, the Companys capital ratio would likely be adversely impacted, which in some cases could be significant. In addition to Basel 1 requirements and capital ratios, these estimates assist management, investors and analysts in assessing capital adequacy and comparability under Basel 3 capital standards to other financial services companies. The Company continues to evaluate the potential impact of proposed rules and anticipates it will be in compliance with any final rules by the proposed effective dates  Certain financial measures contained herein represent non-GAAP financial measures. For more information about the non-GAAP financial measures contained herein, please see the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and accompanying reconciliations in the earnings press release for the quarter ended September 30, 2012 and other earnings-related information available through the Bank of America Investor Relations web site at: http://investor.bankofamerica.com 3 Important Presentation Information

Representations and Warranties Claims 1 14  New claims declined compared to 2Q12 as we received fewer claims related to private-label securitizations and from the GSEs, and rescinded claims improved from settlements and other activity  Outstanding claims from GSEs increased due to our ongoing disagreement with FNMA about what constitutes a valid repurchase request, standards for rescission of repurchase requests and resolution processes  At September 30, 2012, $9.2B of the outstanding claims submitted by GSEs relate to loans on which the borrowers had made at least 25 payments compared to $3.7B at December 31, 2011  90% of the increase in GSE outstanding claims from the end of 2011 is a result of claims received where the borrower had made at least 25 payments  Private-label claims are primarily related to repurchase requests received on private-label securitization transactions not included in the BNY Mellon settlement, including claims related to third-party sponsored securitizations that include monoline insurance  In the third quarter of 2012, as a result of continued dialogue and discussions with the GSEs, we have obtained additional information from which we are now able to determine a reasonable estimate of a range of possible loss (RPL) in excess of our recorded representations and warranties liability for the GSEs. The company currently estimates that the RPL for both GSE and non-GSE representations and warranties exposures could be up to $6B over accruals at September 30, 2012 compared to $5B over accruals at June 30, 2012 for only non-GSE representations and warranties exposures. The increase in the RPL from June 30, 2012 is the net impact of, among other changes, updated assumptions, the inclusion of GSE representations and warranties exposure and other developments.

The outstanding amounts of these demands were $1.7B as of September 30, 2012, $3.1B as of both June 30, 2012 and March 31, 2012 and $1.7B as of both December 31, 2011 and September 30, 2011. The demands outstanding declined as $1.4B of the demands were resolved through the dismissal of the Walnut Place lawsuit in July 2012. At September 30, 2012, approximately $300MM related to the BNY Mellon Settlement. We do not believe that the $1.7B in demands outstanding at September 30, 2012 are valid repurchase claims, and therefore it is not possible to predict the resolution with respect to such demands. 2 Mix for new claims trend is calculated based on last four quarters.

 Net charge-offs increased $519MM in 3Q12 compared to 2Q12 driven by the change in treatment of loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy 5 ($478MM) and National Mortgage Settlement activity ($435MM)  Excluding these items, net charge-offs declined $394MM due to continued improvements in U.S. credit card and home equity  30+ days performing delinquencies (excluding fully-insured consumer real estate loans) decreased $298MM from 2Q12  Nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties remained relatively flat  Addition of $1.1B relating to the change in treatment of loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy 5 was offset by $435MM related to National Mortgage Settlement activities and $659MM of other improvements  Total consumer provision expense was $1.6B ($3.8B charge-offs and reserve reduction of $2.2B)  Includes $339MM of provision expense related to the change in treatment of loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy 5  Excluding the change in treatment of loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy 5, National Mortgage Settlement and PCI activity, reserve reductions were essentially flat  Allowance for loans and leases decreased $3.9B from 2Q12 to $23.1B which provides 4.1% coverage of loans  Includes $1.9B reduction in PCI allowance due primarily to the National Mortgage Settlement-related forgiveness of home equity loans for which reserves were previously established  Allowance covers 1.54 times current period annualized net charge-offs compared to 2.06 times in 2Q12 (excluding PCI allowance: 1.06x in 3Q12 vs. 1.38x in 2Q12)  Allowance covers 2.22 times (1.46x excluding PCI allowance) current period annualized net charge-offs excluding the National Mortgage Settlement and the change in treatment of loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy 5 32 ____________________ 1 3Q12 excludes write-offs of consumer PCI loans of $1.7B 2 Excludes FHA-insured loans and other loans individually insured under long-term standby agreements. 3 Represents a non-GAAP financial measure. 4 Excludes FVO loans. 5 In 3Q12, we adopted new regulatory guidance regarding the treatment of loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy as described on slide 21 of this presentation.

The Corporation evaluates its business based on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP financial measure. The Corporation believes managing the business with net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and noninterest income. The Corporation views related ratios and analyses (i.e., efficiency ratios and net interest yield) on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. To derive the fully taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield evaluates the basis points the Corporation earns over the cost of funds.
The Corporation also evaluates its business based on the following ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on average tangible common shareholders equity measures the Corporations earnings contribution as a percentage of average common shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders equity measures the Corporations earnings contribution as a percentage of average shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible common equity ratio represents ending common shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible equity ratio represents total ending shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents ending common shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporations use of equity (i.e., capital). In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals.
In addition, the Corporation evaluates its business segment results based on return on average economic capital, a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on average economic capital for the segments is calculated as net income adjusted for cost of funds and earnings credits and certain expenses related to intangibles, divided by average economic capital. Economic capital represents average allocated equity less goodwill and a percentage of intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights). It also believes the use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides additional clarity in assessing the segments.
In certain presentations, earnings and diluted earnings per common share, the efficiency ratio, return on average assets, return on common shareholders equity, return on average tangible common shareholders equity and return on average tangible shareholders equity are calculated excluding the impact of goodwill impairment charges of
$581 million
and
$2.6 billion
recorded in the fourth and second quarters of 2011. Accordingly, these are non-GAAP financial measures.
