(NYSE: BAX) today reported that it achieved its sales and diluted earnings per share (EPS) goals for the first quarter of 2003. Baxter's sales grew 6 percent in the first quarter, while earnings declined as a result of product mix and competitive pricing in the plasma market. Baxter's sales from continuing operations in the quarter rose to $2.0 billion, up from $1.88 billion reported for the same period last year. The increase in sales for the first quarter included a 4 percentage-point benefit from foreign exchange. Sales within the United States grew 4 percent to $956 million, while sales outside the United States grew 9 percent to $1.04 billion (or declined 1 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange). First quarter sales for Renal grew 2 percent to $407 million and sales in BioScience were down 1 percent at $740 million. Medication Delivery sales grew 17 percent to $850 million. Contributing to the growth in Medication Delivery were strong sales of anesthesia and drug delivery products, as well as sales from ESI Lederle, which Baxter acquired at the end of 2002. - more -
BAXTER REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2003 EARNINGS - PAGE 2 - --------------------------------------------------- Baxter's earnings from continuing operations in the first quarter totaled $217 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, a decline of 14 percent from the $253 million, or 12 percent from the $0.41 per diluted share reported last year. The first quarter results include a pre-tax impairment charge of $13 million to reflect the decline in the market value of a minority investment. "Despite the current challenges in the plasma protein business, I expect our sales growth for the full year to be in the 8 to 12 percent range and our EPS growth to be in the $2.10 to $2.20 range, in addition to generating cash flows from continuing operations of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion before capital expenditures," said Harry M. Jansen Kraemer, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "With the many new product launches we have planned for 2003, combined with our ongoing expansion with current products into new markets, we believe we are well positioned to achieve our goals." Contributing to growth for full-year 2003 will be the anticipated approval and launch of the company's innovative hemophilia therapy ADVATE, which will offer patients the first Factor VIII recombinant therapy to be clinically developed and prepared without the addition of any human- or animal-derived raw materials. Specifically for the second quarter, the company expects to achieve sales growth in the range of 8 to 10 percent and EPS in the range of $0.40 to $0.42. Among the contributors to the growth in the second quarter will be the launch of several products, including the new peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution, Extraneal, and the ALYX Red Blood Cell Collection System. The launch of Extraneal is the first of several new product launches anticipated in the Renal business this year in an effort to continually refresh its product line for patients with end-stage renal disease. - more -
