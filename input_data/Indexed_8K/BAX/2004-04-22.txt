FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 
DEERFIELD, Ill., April 22, 2004Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today reported its financial results for the first quarter, with sales increasing 11 percent and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations totaling $0.31, compared to the company's guidance of $0.28 to $0.31 per diluted share.
 
Baxter's sales totaled $2.21 billion in the first quarter, with foreign exchange favorably impacting sales by 7 percentage points. Sales within the United States grew 7 percent to $1.02 billion, while sales outside the United States grew 14 percent (including a 12 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange) to $1.19 billion. Sales from Baxter's BioScience business increased 9 percent to $810 million, while the company's Medication Delivery business grew 9 percent in the first quarter to $929 million, and Renal sales grew 16 percent to $470 million.

"While organic sales growth was in line with our expectations, we need to take further actions to realign our cost structure to drive greater profitability," said Brian P. Anderson, senior vice president and chief financial officer. "Therefore, we will implement a number of additional initiatives to better leverage our resources, with a focus on standardizing and consolidating work processes and reducing capacity in our plasma business, in order to drive sustainable improvements in our financial performance."
 
As announced in January 2004, Baxter plans to begin implementing additional actions to reduce costs. These actions will include the elimination of approximately 3,500 to 4,000 additional positions, or approximately 7 to 8 percent of Baxter's current global workforce. About half of the positions to be eliminated are located in the United States, and half located outside the United States, with nearly three-quarters of the savings within general and administrative expenses. While the market for plasma-derived products has stabilized, the company intends to further enhance profitability and cash flow by adjusting its plasma production. Accordingly, Baxter plans to reduce plasma production by 400,000 liters, or 13 percent, annually and close additional plasma collection centers.
 
The company anticipates that it will record an after-tax charge in the second quarter of 2004 of approximately $350 to $400 million, or $0.55 to $0.65 per diluted share, principally for severance and costs associated with the closing of facilities. Baxter expects that these additional initiatives will yield savings of $0.05 per diluted share in the second half of 2004, $0.20 to $0.25 per diluted share in 2005, and $0.30 to $0.35 per diluted share when fully implemented in 2006.

Looking forward to the second quarter, the company expects its sales growth to be between 4 to 6 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to be $0.37 to $0.41 excluding the impact of the 2004 restructuring charges and benefits. For full-year 2004, Baxter expects sales growth to be between 3 to 5 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Baxter also expects to achieve earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $1.75 to $1.85, excluding the impact of the 2004 restructuring charges and benefits, and to generate cash flow from continuing operations of approximately $1.5 billion.

What is the status of the Advate launch? What were Advate sales in the first quarter?
 
Baxter received clearance from regulatory authorities in Europe in March, and has launched Advate in Germany, the Netherlands and United Kingdom. Advate contributed $27 million in sales to the total of $292 million in recombinant sales in the first quarter, helping grow that product line by 19 percent.

involved the closing and/or consolidation of a number of facilities worldwide, elimination of approximately 3,000 positions worldwide, and changes in its plasma operations that reduced plasma production by 600,000 liters and closed 26 plasma collection centers across the United States. The company is on track in implementing these initiatives, and has eliminated approximately 85 percent of the positions and generated savings of $0.04 per diluted share in the first quarter 2004.
