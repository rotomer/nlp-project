ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. On October 20, 2005, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2005. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. The press release contains several non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. These measures are used in addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the company's business. Management strongly encourages investors to review the company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share, each excluding certain items that are unusual or nonrecurring. Unusual or nonrecurring items can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period. Management believes that these non-GAAP earnings measures can facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in financial planning, to monitor performance, and in setting performance compensation targets. The release also uses "free cash flow," which is defined as cash flow from continuing operations less capital expenditures and is not a measure defined in accordance with GAAP. This measure is used internally to evaluate the company's cash performance, and management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure to investors in that it provides a representation of the company's cash level available to reduce debt outstanding, pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock or make strategic investments and acquisitions.

Exhibit 99.1 BAXTER REPORTS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER COMPANY DELIVERS SOLID OPERATING RESULTS AND CONTINUED CASH FLOW IMPROVEMENT DEERFIELD, Ill., Oct. 20 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Baxter International Inc. (NYSE: BAX) today reported its financial results for the third quarter of 2005. On an adjusted basis, excluding special charges described below, earnings from continuing operations totaled $296 million, and earnings per diluted share of $0.47 increased 12 percent compared to the third quarter of 2004. Including these previously announced charges of $0.29 per diluted share in the quarter, Baxter's earnings from continuing operations on a GAAP basis totaled $116 million, or $0.18 per diluted share. The previously announced charges recorded in the third quarter include a charge of $163 million (or $0.26 per diluted share) for the estimated tax expense related to the company's planned repatriation of approximately $2.0 billion in foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act, and an after-tax charge of $20 million (or $0.03 per diluted share) for costs associated with Baxter's decision to discontinue hemodialysis instrument manufacturing. Worldwide sales totaled $2.4 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 3 percent over the same period last year (including a 1 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange). Domestic sales declined 2 percent to $1.1 billion, while international sales grew 9 percent (including a 3 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange) to $1.3 billion. Contributing to sales growth was the continued strength of the BioScience business, with sales of $950 million, representing an increase of 12 percent compared to the third quarter of 2004. Sales growth in this business was driven by a 15 percent increase in the recombinant business, including $162 million of sales of ADVATE, Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin Free Method (rAHF-PFM) for the treatment of hemophilia A. Offsetting the strong sales in the BioScience business were lower sales of the company's COLLEAGUE Infusion Pump, which was on hold during the third quarter. COLLEAGUE Infusion Pump sales totaled approximately $65 million in the third quarter of 2004. Cash flow from continuing operations totaled $536 million for the quarter, compared to $277 million in the same period last year. Free cash flow (cash flow from continuing operations, less capital expenditures of $116 million in 2005 and $134 million in 2004) was $420 million for the quarter, an improvement of $277 million from the third quarter last year. "We continue to focus on driving improved operating results and cash flow, which has enhanced our overall financial flexibility," said John Greisch, chief financial officer. "We have again achieved our financial commitments through improved operational execution across all of our businesses."
New Product Launches and Partnerships "In addition to our strong operating results in the third quarter, we made further progress on achieving R&D milestones and finalizing new partnerships," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, "We remain committed to providing value to our shareholders through predictable and sustainable growth over the long term, improving cash flow generation and capital allocation, and accelerating internal R&D and business development initiatives." During the third quarter, Baxter launched several new products and announced new collaborations, including research agreements with Nektar Therapeutics and Lipoxen Technologies. These collaborations focus on further advancing ADVATE, with the objective of reducing the frequency of infusions and enhancing quality of life for hemophilia patients. In addition to these agreements, the company launched GAMMAGARD LIQUID [Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)] (IVIG) 10% Solution in the United States for the treatment of primary immunodeficiencies, and recently received FDA approval of FLEXBUMIN, the first preparation of human albumin to be packaged in a flexible container. Nine-Month Results For the first nine months of 2005, Baxter's worldwide sales grew 7 percent to $7.4 billion, up from $6.9 billion in the same period last year. Foreign exchange favorably impacted sales growth by 3 percentage points year-to-date. Domestic sales totaled $3.3 billion, an increase of 2 percent over the same period last year, while international sales increased 11 percent (including a 5 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange), to $4.1 billion. On an adjusted basis, excluding charges, the company reported year-to-date earnings from continuing operations of $829 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, an increase of 18 percent over the same period last year. Including the charges and restructuring benefits recorded in the second and third quarters, Baxter's income from continuing operations totaled $664 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, in the first nine months of the year. Cash flow from continuing operations totaled $1.3 billion for the first nine months of the year, compared to $529 million in the same period in 2004. Free cash flow (cash flow from continuing operations, less capital expenditures of $279 million in 2005 and $363 million in 2004) was $1.0 billion for the first nine months of 2005, an improvement of $870 million from the same period last year. Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2005 Outlook For the fourth quarter of 2005, the company expects organic sales to decline in low single digits, and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to total $0.56 to $0.58. Accordingly, for full-year 2005, Baxter expects to achieve organic sales growth of 3 to 4 percent and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $1.88 to $1.90. Baxter also now expects cash flow from continuing operations for full-year 2005 to be approximately $1.7 billion, and to generate free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion in 2005 (after approximately $500 million of anticipated capital expenditures). The company's guidance excludes the $0.26 per diluted share from the second and third quarter charges and restructuring adjustments, and also excludes further special charges in the balance of the year, including additional tax effects of the company's planned repatriation of approximately $2 billion under the American Jobs Creation Act, future costs associated with the company's decision to discontinue hemodialysis instrument manufacturing, any additional COLLEAGUE Infusion Pump-related charges, and costs associated with early debt retirement.

These mirror swaps fix the net amount the company will ultimately pay to settle the swaps subject to this strategy. After execution of the mirror swaps, as the market value of the fixed portion of the original portfolio decreases, the market value of the mirror swaps increases, and vice versa. At September 30, 2005, approximately 52% of the net swaps liability has been fixed by the mirror swaps. During the nine months ended September 30, 2005, the company settled certain swap agreements (and related mirror swaps, as applicable), and made net payments totaling $379 million. In accordance with GAAP, $432 million of outflows were classified in the financing section of the statement of cash flows, and $53 million of inflows were classified in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. (2) The increase in short-term debt from December 31, 2004 to September 30, 2005 principally related to the reclassification of approximately $800 million of notes due in 2006 from long-term to short-term.
