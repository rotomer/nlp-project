therein not misleading; or (ii) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any other Remarketing Materials (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact, in each case, necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (iii) in whole or in part upon any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the Company contained herein; or (iv) in whole or in part upon any failure of the Company to perform its obligations hereunder or under law; or (v) any act or failure to act or any alleged act or failure to act by the Remarketing Agent in connection with, or relating in any manner to, the Remarketed Senior Notes or the Remarketing contemplated hereby, and which is included as part of or referred to in any loss, claim, damage, liability or action arising out of or based upon any matter covered by clause (i) or (ii) above, and to reimburse the Remarketing Agent and each such controlling person for any and all expenses (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Remarketing Agent) as such expenses are reasonably incurred by the Remarketing Agent or such controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense to the extent, but only to the extent, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Remarketing Agent expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any other Remarketing Materials (or any amendment or supplement thereto); and provided, further, that with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus, the foregoing indemnity agreement shall not inure to the benefit of the Remarketing Agent if the person asserting any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense purchased Remarketed Senior Notes, or any person controlling the Remarketing Agent, if copies of the Prospectus were timely delivered to the Remarketing Agent and a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agent to such person, if required by law so to have been delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the Remarketed Senior Notes to such person, and if the Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense. The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(a) shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Company may otherwise have.
     (b) The Remarketing Agent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, or at common law or otherwise (including in settlement of any litigation, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Remarketing Agent), insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any other Remarketing Materials (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or arises out of or is based upon the omission or alleged omission to state
 
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any other Remarketing Materials (or any amendment or supplement thereto), in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Remarketing Agent expressly for use therein; and to reimburse the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person for any legal and other expense reasonably incurred by the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action. The Company hereby acknowledges that the only information that the Remarketing Agent has furnished to the Company expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any other Remarketing Materials (or any amendment or supplement thereto) is the information set forth in a certificate to be provided by the Remarketing Agent on or prior to the Remarketing Date. The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(b) shall be in addition to any liabilities that each Underwriter may otherwise have.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party for contribution or otherwise than under the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 8 or to the extent it is not prejudiced as a proximate result of such failure. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (together with local counsel), approved by the indemnifying party (the Remarketing Agent in the case of Section 8(b)), representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action) or (ii) the
 
indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
     (d) The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there is a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 8(c) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     SECTION 9. Contribution.
     If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is for any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Remarketing Agent, on the other hand, from the Remarketing of the Remarketed Senior Notes pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Remarketing Agent, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions or inaccuracies in the representations and warranties herein which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Remarketing Agent, on the other hand, in connection with the Remarketing of the Remarketed Senior Notes pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the Remarketing of the Remarketed Senior Notes pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total Remarketing Fee received by the Remarketing Agent, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate Remarketing Price of the Remarketed Senior Notes as set forth on such cover. The
 
relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Remarketing Agent, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact or any such inaccurate or alleged inaccurate representation or warranty relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Remarketing Agent, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(c), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
     The provisions set forth in Section 8(c) with respect to notice of commencement of any action shall apply if a claim for contribution is to be made under this Section 9; provided, however, that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given under Section 8(c) for purposes of indemnification.
     The Company and the Remarketing Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, the Remarketing Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the Remarketing Fee exceeds the amount of any damages which the Remarketing Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 9, each officer and employee of the Remarketing Agent and each person, if any, who controls the Remarketing Agent within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Remarketing Agent, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
     SECTION 10. Resignation And Removal Of The Remarketing Agent.
     Banc of America, CSFB or UBS (the "Remarketing Agent Candidates") may resign and be discharged from their duties and obligations hereunder, and the Company may remove any of the Remarketing Agent Candidates, by giving 30 days' prior written notice, in the case of a resignation, to the Company and the Depositary and, in the case of a removal, to the removed Remarketing Agent Candidate and the Depositary; provided, however, that if only one Remarketing Agent Candidate remains:
     (a) such Remarketing Agent Candidate may not resign without reasonable cause; and
 
     (b) no such resignation nor any such removal shall become effective until the Company shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized broker-dealer as successor Remarketing Agent and such successor Remarketing Agent shall have entered into a remarketing agreement with the Company, in which it shall have agreed to conduct the Remarketing in accordance with the Transaction Documents in all material respects.
In any such case, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to appoint a successor Remarketing Agent and enter into such a remarketing agreement with such person as soon as reasonably practicable. The provisions of Section 8 and Section 9 shall survive the resignation or removal of any Remarketing Agent Candidate pursuant to this Agreement.
     SECTION 11. Dealing In Securities. The Remarketing Agent, when acting as a Remarketing Agent or in its individual or any other capacity, may, to the extent permitted by law, buy, sell, hold and deal in any of the Remarketed Senior Notes, Corporate Units, Treasury Units or any of the securities of the Company (together, the "Securities"). The Remarketing Agent may exercise any vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of such Securities may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Indenture with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder. The Remarketing Agent, in its individual capacity, either as principal or agent, may also engage in or have an interest in any financial or other transaction with the Company as freely as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder.
     SECTION 12. Remarketing Agent's Performance; Duty Of Care.

No implied covenants or obligations of or against the Remarketing Agent shall be read into this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents. In the absence of bad faith on the part of the Remarketing Agent, the Remarketing Agent may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to it, as to the truth of the statements expressed in any of such documents. The Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to have been signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties except as otherwise set forth herein. The Remarketing Agent, acting under this Agreement, shall incur no liability to the Company or to any holder of Remarketed Senior Notes in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent for any action or failure to act, on its part in connection with a Remarketing or otherwise, except if such liability is judicially determined to have resulted from its failure to comply with the material terms of this Agreement or the gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part. The provisions of this Section 12 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall survive the resignation or removal of any Remarketing Agent pursuant to this Agreement.
     SECTION 13. Termination. This Agreement shall automatically terminate (i) as to the Remarketing Agent on the effective date of the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 10 and (ii) on the earlier of (x) any Special Event Redemption Date and (y) the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any of the other provisions hereof, except as otherwise provided herein, the Company shall not be under any liability to the Remarketing Agent and the Remarketing Agent shall not be under any liability to the Company, except that if this Agreement is terminated by the Remarketing Agent because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Remarketing Agent for
 
all of its out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of its counsel) reasonably incurred by it. Section 8, Section 9 and Section 12 hereof shall survive the termination of this Agreement or the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agent.

Interest on the Senior Notes shall accrue from December 17, 2002.

In the event that any scheduled Interest Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such Interest Payment Date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such Business Day is in the next calendar year, then such payment will be made on the preceding Business Day.

In addition, the Company shall notify the Collateral Agent in writing that a Special Event has occurred and that the Company intends to redeem the Senior Notes on the Special Event Redemption Date.

Following the notice of a Special Event Redemption, neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be required to register the transfer of or exchange the Senior Notes to be redeemed.
     Section 3.02. Redemption Procedures.

extent permitted by law, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Supplemental Indenture or of the Senior Notes, but this Supplemental Indenture and the Senior Notes shall be construed as if such invalid or illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein or therein.
     Section 7.05. Counterparts. This Supplemental Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts each of which shall be an original, but such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

The Company will request, not later than seven nor more than 15 calendar days prior to the applicable Remarketing Date, that the Depositary or its nominee notify the Beneficial Owners or Depositary Participants holding Separate Senior Notes, Corporate Units and Treasury Units of the procedures to be followed in the applicable Remarketing.
     (b) Each Holder of Separate Senior Notes may elect to have Separate Senior Notes held by such Holder remarketed in any Remarketing. A Holder making such an election must, pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, notify the Custodial Agent and deliver such Separate Senior Notes to the Custodial Agent prior to 5:00 P.M. (New York City time) on or prior to the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date (but no earlier than the Interest Payment Date immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date).

presented to the Remarketing Agent. Under Section 5.02 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, Senior Notes that are components of Corporate Units will be deemed tendered for Remarketing and will be remarketed in accordance with the terms of the Remarketing Agreement.

     (d) Neither the Trustee, the Company nor the Remarketing Agent shall be obligated in any case to provide funds to make payment upon tender of Senior Notes for remarketing.
     Section 8.02. Remarketing. (a) Unless a Special Event Redemption has occurred prior to the Initial Remarketing Date, on the Initial Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agent shall, pursuant and subject to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, use its reasonable efforts to remarket the Remarketed Senior Notes at a price (the "Remarketing Price") equal to approximately 100.25% of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price and the Separate Senior Note Purchase Price.
     (b) In the case of a Failed Initial Remarketing and unless a Special Event Redemption has occurred prior to the Final Remarketing Date, on the Final Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agent shall use its reasonable efforts to remarket the Remarketed Senior Notes at a price (the "Final Remarketing Price") equal to approximately 100.25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Remarketed Senior Notes. It is understood and agreed that Remarketing on any Remarketing Date will be considered successful and no further attempts will be made if the resulting proceeds are at least 100.25% of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price and the Separate Senior Note Purchase Price, in the case of the Initial Remarketing, or 100.25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Remarketed Senior Notes in the case of the Final Remarketing.
     Section 8.03. Reset Rate. (a) In connection with each Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent shall determine the Reset Rate (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth (0.001) of one percent per annum) that the Remarketed Senior Notes
 
should bear in order to have an aggregate market value equal to the Remarketing Price or the Final Remarketing Price, as the case may be, and that in the sole discretion of the Remarketing Agent will enable it to remarket all of the Remarketed Senior Notes at the Remarketing Price or Final Remarketing Price, as the case may be, in such Remarketing.
     (b) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Reset Rate shall in no event exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law and the Remarketing Agent shall have no obligation to determine whether there is any limitation under applicable law on the Reset Rate or, if there is any such limitation, the maximum permissible Reset Rate on the Senior Notes and they shall rely solely upon written notice from the Company (which the Company agrees to provide prior to the eighth Business Day before the Initial Remarketing Date) as to whether or not there is any such limitation and, if so, the maximum permissible Reset Rate.
     (c) In the event of a Failed Remarketing or if no Senior Notes are included in Corporate Units and none of the holders of the Separate Senior Notes elect to have their Senior Notes remarketed in any Remarketing, the applicable interest rate on the Senior Notes will not be reset and will continue to be the Coupon Rate.
     (d) In the event of a Successful Remarketing, the Coupon Rate shall be reset at the Reset Rate as determined by the Remarketing Agent under the Remarketing Agreement.
     Section 8.04. Failed Remarketing. (a) If, by 4:00 p.m. (New York City time) on any Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agent is unable to remarket all of the Remarketed Senior Notes at the Remarketing Price or the Final Remarketing Price, as the case may be, pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof, a Failed Remarketing shall be deemed to have occurred, and the Remarketing Agent shall so advise, by telephone the Depositary, the Purchase Contract Agent and the Company. Promptly following any Failed Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent shall return Separate Senior Notes submitted for remarketing, if any, to the Custodial Agent for distribution to the appropriate Holders.
     (b) The Company shall cause a notice of such Failed Remarketing to be published in a daily newspaper in the English language of general circulation in the City of New York, which is expected to be The Wall Street Journal.
     Section 8.05. Put Right. (a) If there has not been a Successful Remarketing prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, Holders of Separate Senior Notes and Holders of Senior Notes that are a component of Corporate
 
Units will, subject to this Section 8.05, have the right (the "Put Right") to require the Company to purchase their Senior Notes, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, at a price per Senior Note equal to $50.00 plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date (the "Put Price").
     (b) The Put Right of Holders of Senior Notes that are part of Corporate Units will be automatically exercised unless such Holders (1) prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, provide written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent of their intention to settle the related Purchase Contract with separate cash, and (2) on or prior to the Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, deliver to the Collateral Agent $50 in cash per Purchase Contract, in each case pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement. Unless a Corporate Unit holder has settled the related Purchase Contract with separate cash on or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Company, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, shall cause the Put Price to be deposited in the Collateral Account and the Collateral Agent shall cause the Securities Intermediary to remit the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under the related Purchase Contract from a portion of the Proceeds of the Put Right to the Company in full satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under the related Purchase Contract. Any remaining amount of the Put Price following satisfaction of the related Purchase Contract will be paid to such Corporate Unit holder. If the Company shall fail to pay the Put Price on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date in accordance with the foregoing, the Company shall be deemed to have netted its obligation to pay the Put Price against the obligation of a Holder of a Senior Note that is a component of a Corporate Unit to pay the Purchase Price under the related Purchase Contract on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date.
     (c) The Put Right of a Holder of a Separate Senior Note shall only be exercisable upon delivery of a notice to the Trustee by such Holder on or prior to the second Business Day prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. On or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the aggregate Put Price of all Separate Senior Notes with respect to which a Holder has exercised a Put Right. In exchange for any Separate Senior Notes surrendered pursuant to the Put Right, the Trustee shall then distribute such amount to the Holders of such Separate Senior Notes.
     Section 8.06. Additional Event of Default. In addition to the events listed as Events of Default in Section 501 of the Base Indenture, it shall be an additional Event of Default with respect to the Senior Notes, if the Company shall not have satisfied its obligation to pay the Put Price when due in accordance with
 
Section 8.05 (either by payment of the Put Price to the Trustee when due, by deposit of the Put Price in the Collateral Account when due or by netting the Put Price against a Holder's obligation under the related Purchase Contract if a Senior Note is a component of a Corporate Unit).
     Section 9.01. Tax Treatment. The Company agrees, and by acceptance of a Corporate Unit, each holder of a Corporate Unit will be deemed to have agreed (1) for United States federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes to treat the acquisition of a Corporate Unit as the acquisition of the Senior Note and the Purchase Contract constituting the Corporate Unit and (2) to treat the Senior Note as indebtedness for United States federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes. A Holder of Senior Notes may obtain the comparable yield and projected payment schedule for the Senior Notes, determined by the Company pursuant to Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.1275-4, by submitting a written request for such information to the Company at the following address: Baxter International Inc., One Baxter Parkway, Deerfield, Illinois 60015, Attention: Treasurer.
