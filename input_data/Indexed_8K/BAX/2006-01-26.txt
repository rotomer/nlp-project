ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. On January 26, 2006, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the fourth quarter and full-year 2005. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99 to this report. The press release contains several non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. These measures are used in addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the company's business. Management strongly encourages investors to review the company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted income from continuing operations, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted income tax expense, adjusted gross profit and adjusted earnings per share, each excluding certain items that are unusual or nonrecurring. Each of these items is identified in the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures that accompany the press release. Unusual or nonrecurring items can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period. In addition, the tax rate may vary substantially by the type of unusual or recurring item so disclosing income before and after tax impact (as bridged by the tax) may provide users with additional insight into the impact of these items. Management believes that these non-GAAP earnings measures facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor performance, and in setting performance compensation targets. The press release also uses "free cash flow," which is defined as cash flow from continuing operations less capital expenditures and is not a measure defined in accordance with GAAP. This measure is used internally to evaluate the company's cash performance, and management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure to investors in that it provides a representation of the company's cash level available to reduce debt outstanding, pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock or make strategic investments and acquisitions.

Exhibit 99 BAXTER REPORTS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2005 Baxter's Adjusted Earnings and Cash Flow Exceed Company's Previously Issued Guidance Company Provides 2006 Financial Outlook DEERFIELD, Ill., Jan. 26 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Baxter International Inc. (NYSE: BAX) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2005, and provided its financial outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2006. Summary of Fourth Quarter Results On an adjusted basis, excluding special charges described below, Baxter's earnings from continuing operations totaled $379 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.60 increased 5 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2004. Including after-tax special charges of $85 million, or $0.14 per diluted share in the quarter, Baxter's earnings from continuing operations on a GAAP basis totaled $294 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, compared to $0.17 per diluted share in 2004. The previously announced after-tax special charges recorded in the fourth quarter totaled $85 million ($0.14 per diluted share) and included costs associated with the withdrawal of its 6060 ambulatory infusion pump, additional costs associated with Baxter's decision in July 2005 to discontinue hemodialysis instrument manufacturing, costs associated with the early retirement of debt during the quarter, and the tax expense related to the company's completed repatriation of approximately $2.1 billion in foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act. Details of these charges are included in the financial schedules that follow the text of this press release. Worldwide sales totaled $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, a decline of 4 percent compared to the same period last year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales declined 3 percent. Domestic sales declined 11 percent to $1.1 billion, while international sales grew 2 percent to $1.4 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, international sales increased 4 percent. As the company expected, sales were lower in the fourth quarter primarily due to the hold on shipments of the COLLEAGUE Infusion Pump, the effect of exiting several lower-margin businesses, and the impact of generic competition for propofol, an anesthetic agent. Offsetting these items was solid sales growth in Baxter's BioScience business, with sales totaling $1.0 billion, an increase of 6 percent (or 8 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency) compared to the fourth quarter of 2004. Sales growth in the BioScience business was driven by increased sales of ADVATE, Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin Free Method (rAHF-PFM) for the treatment of hemophilia A, which totaled $174 million for the quarter and over $600 million for the full year. In addition, Bioscience sales were driven by strong growth in sales of Antibody Therapy products, which included recently-launched GAMMAGARD LIQUID(TM) [Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)] (IVIG) 10% Solution for the treatment of primary immunodeficiencies.
Summary of Full-Year 2005 Results For full-year 2005, Baxter's worldwide sales grew 4 percent to $9.8 billion, up from $9.5 billion reported last year. Foreign exchange favorably impacted sales growth by 2 percentage points during the year. Domestic sales totaled $4.4 billion, a decline of 2 percent from last year, while international sales increased 8 percent (including a 3 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange), to $5.5 billion. On an adjusted basis, excluding net special charges, the company reported 2005 earnings from continuing operations of $1.2 billion, or $1.92 per diluted share, an increase of 14 percent over last year. Baxter's adjusted earnings exceeded the company's financial guidance for 2005 of $1.88 to $1.90, excluding net charges. Including net charges recorded during the year of $250 million ($0.40 per diluted share), Baxter's income from continuing operations totaled $958 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, compared to $0.62 per diluted share in 2004. Details of net charges recorded in 2004 and 2005 are included in the financial schedules that follow the text of this press release. Excluding the previously announced $400 million contribution in the fourth quarter to domestic pension plans, cash flow from operations totaled $2.0 billion, or $1.6 billion after the pension contribution. Baxter's full-year cash flow performance exceeded the company's financial guidance for 2005, which had projected cash flow from operations of approximately $1.7 billion, excluding the fourth quarter pension plan contribution. Free cash flow (cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures of $444 million in 2005) totaled $1.1 billion, or $1.5 billion excluding the fourth quarter pension plan contribution. During the year, Baxter achieved significant reductions in a number of its financial obligations. Debt was reduced by approximately $1.0 billion, and the company made contributions of approximately $570 million to its pension plans. Baxter also reduced its net investment hedge liabilities by $527 million during the year. "We have made considerable progress during 2005, meeting or exceeding virtually all of our key financial objectives, despite the challenges with the COLLEAGUE Infusion Pump," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "During 2005, we also increased our spending on R&D and accelerated the pace of business development initiatives, which reflects our commitment to reinvigorating innovation within our company." First Quarter and Full-Year 2006 Outlook For the first time, Baxter is providing its financial outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2006. Due to the continued hold on shipments of the COLLEAGUE Infusion Pump and the uncertainty of the timing of resuming COLLEAGUE sales, the company's guidance for full-year 2006 does not reflect any pump sales or earnings contributions from this product. Baxter's guidance also excludes the impact of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (Revised 2003), "Share-Based Payment" (SFAS No. 123-R), relating to stock option expense. The company estimates stock option expense of approximately $0.08 to $0.10 per diluted share for full year 2006. For full-year 2006, Baxter expects to achieve organic sales growth of 4 to 5 percent and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.08 to $2.16, before any special items. Baxter expects cash flow from operations for full-year 2006 to total approximately $1.9 billion, with free cash flow of approximately $1.4 billion (after approximately $550 million of anticipated capital expenditures). For the first quarter of 2006, the company expects organic sales to grow 2 to 3 percent, and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to total $0.41 to $0.43, before any special items. The first quarter guidance excludes the impact of adopting SFAS No. 123-R, which the company estimates to be approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per diluted share.
"The significant progress we've made in improving our balance sheet, earnings and cash flow in 2005 provides us with considerable financial flexibility," said John J. Greisch, corporate vice president and chief financial officer. "Our 2006 guidance includes increased investments in sales and marketing, and accelerated spending in research and development and business development activities."

BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC. Cash Flows from Operations and Changes in Net Debt (unaudited) ($ in millions) Cash Flows from Operations - --------------------------
Changes in Net Debt - ------------------- (A) The 2004 net-debt-to-capital ratio was calculated in accordance with the company's primary credit agreements, which gave 70% equity credit to the company's December 2002 $1.25 billion issuance of equity units. As originally scheduled, in November 2005, the $1.25 billion senior notes included in the equity units were remarketed, and the company repurchased $1 billion of the remarketed notes. In February 2006, the purchase contracts included in the equity units will mature, and the company will receive $1.25 billion in cash and issue between 35.0 to 43.4 million common shares, based on a specified exchange ratio (if the average price of the company's stock over the 20-day trading period ending on February 13th exceeds $35.69, then 35 million shares will be issued). Management plans to use a portion of the cash proceeds to pay down maturing debt. As a result of these cash proceeds, the company's net-debt-to-capital ratio will decrease significantly during the first quarter of 2006. Holding all other variables constant, the February 2006 $1.25 billion cash proceeds would reduce the net-debt-to-capital ratio at December 31, 2005 by 18.4 percentage points, from 36.7% to 18.3%.

These mirror swaps fix the net amount the company will ultimately pay to settle the swaps subject to this strategy. After execution of the mirror swaps, as the market value of the fixed portion of the original portfolio decreases, the market value of the mirror swaps increases, and vice versa. At December 31, 2005, approximately 52% of the net swaps liability has been fixed by the mirror swaps. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the company settled certain swap agreements (and related mirror swaps, as applicable), and made net payments totaling $379 million. In accordance with GAAP, $432 million of outflows were classified in the financing section of the statement of cash flows, and $53 million of inflows were classified in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. (2) The increase in short-term debt from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005 principally related to the reclassification of approximately $800 million of notes due in 2006 from long-term to short-term.
