ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. On April 20, 2006, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2006. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99 to this report. The press release contains non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. These measures are used in addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the company's business. Management strongly encourages investors to review the company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. The press release uses the non-GAAP financial measure earnings per diluted share, before special items and excluding the impact of stock-option expense under SFAS No. 123-R. Special items are excluded because they are unusual or nonrecurring and accordingly can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period. Stock-option expense under SFAS No. 123-R is excluded to provide a comparison to prior periods that have not been restated to include such expenses. Management believes that this non-GAAP earnings measure facilitates a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses this non-GAAP measure internally in financial planning, to monitor performance, and in setting performance compensation targets. The press release also uses "free cash flow," which is defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and is not a measure defined in accordance with GAAP. This measure is used internally to evaluate the company's cash performance, and management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure to investors in that it provides a representation of the company's cash level available to reduce debt outstanding, pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock or make strategic investments and acquisitions.

Exhibit 99 CORPORATE NEWS Baxter International Inc. One Baxter Parkway Deerfield, IL 60015 [LOGO OF BAXTER] FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE --------------------- MEDIA CONTACTS: Deborah Spak, (847) 948-2349 Tom Kline, (847) 948-2251 INVESTOR CONTACTS: Mary Kay Ladone, (847) 948-3371 Clare Sullivan, (847) 948-3085 BAXTER REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE OF $0.43, AN INCREASE OF 19 PERCENT COMPANY NARROWS FULL-YEAR EARNINGS GUIDANCE RANGE DEERFIELD, Ill., April 20, 2006 - Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today reported stronger than expected growth in earnings and organic sales for the first quarter. First quarter net income of $282 million increased 26 percent compared to $224 million in the first quarter of 2005. Earnings per diluted share of $0.43 increased 19 percent over last year. Contributing to the growth in earnings were improved margins, lower interest expense and a lower tax rate. Excluding the impact of stock-option expense of $0.02 per diluted share under SFAS No. 123-R, earnings per diluted share totaled $0.45, which compares favorably with the guidance that Baxter previously provided for the quarter of $0.41 to $0.43 (which also excluded the impact of stock-option expense). -more-
BAXTER REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS/PAGE 2 - ------------------------------------------- Baxter's sales totaled $2.4 billion in the first quarter, an increase of 4 percent on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. Organic sales growth exceeded Baxter's guidance of 2 to 3 percent due to strong growth in the company's BioScience business. Including the negative impact of foreign exchange, reported sales grew 1 percent in the quarter. Sales within the United States totaled $1.1 billion, an increase of 1 percent over the same period last year, and sales outside of the United States also grew 1 percent (or 6 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange) to $1.3 billion in the quarter. Strong sales in the company's BioScience business, which totaled $1.0 billion and grew 11 percent, offset the impact of foreign exchange and the impact of the COLLEAGUE(R) Infusion Pump hold, generic competition and the exit of lower-margin businesses. "We are extremely pleased with our first quarter financial results," said John J. Greisch, Baxter's chief financial officer. "Our strong financial performance reflects the value of our diversified portfolio and our ability to meet or exceed our commitments while improving the financial profile of the company." Baxter's cash flow also improved in the quarter. The company generated $305 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter compared to $272 million in the same period last year. "We've made great progress over the last several quarters improving our financial position and operational execution, expanding our global market positions, and focusing our efforts on enhancing product innovation and R&D productivity," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "Our strong first quarter financial performance allows us to accelerate R&D and strategic investments throughout the rest of the year that position the company to deliver value to our patients, customers and shareholders over the long term." -more-
BAXTER REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS/PAGE 3 - ------------------------------------------- RECENT HIGHLIGHTS Baxter recently announced several initiatives that leverage the company's unique technology platforms and further expand its global presence. These initiatives include: o A $60 million investment to expand production capacity at its four manufacturing facilities in China to accommodate anticipated growth in demand for the company's intravenous solutions (IV) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) products. o The launch of generic sevoflurane, a widely used inhalation anesthetic, in Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. o The launch in Europe of KIOVIG (TM) [Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)], Baxter's ready-to-use liquid 10% Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG), and the U.S. launch of FLEXBUMIN(TM), the first preparation of human albumin to be packaged in a flexible container. o Initiation of the first human Phase II adult stem-cell therapy trial in the United States to investigate the efficacy, tolerability and safety of blood-derived, selected CD34+ stem cells to reduce symptoms and improve clinical outcomes in patients with chronic myocardial ischemia. -more-
BAXTER REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS/PAGE 4 - ------------------------------------------- SECOND QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2006 OUTLOOK Given the strong financial performance of the company in the first quarter, Baxter is narrowing its earnings guidance range for the full-year 2006. The company now expects to achieve organic sales growth of 4 to 5 percent, and earnings per diluted share of $2.10 to $2.16, before special items and excluding the impact of stock-option expense of $0.08 to $0.10 per diluted share. This compares favorably to the company's original guidance of $2.08 to $2.16, which also excluded special items and stock-option expense. Baxter continues to expect cash flow from operations for full-year 2006 to total approximately $1.9 billion, with free cash flow of approximately $1.4 billion (after approximately $550 million of anticipated capital expenditures). For the second quarter of 2006, the company expects organic sales (excluding the impact of foreign exchange) to grow 2 to 3 percent, and earnings per diluted share of $0.54 to $0.56, before special items and excluding the impact of stock-option expense of approximately $0.03 per diluted share.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2006 AND 2005 (unaudited) (in millions, except per share and percentage data) Note: Effective January 1, 2006, the company adopted SFAS No. 123-R using the modified prospective method. After-tax stock-option expense for the first quarter of 2006 was $10 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. In accordance with the modified prospective adoption method, the company did not adjust its historical consolidated financial statements to reflect the impact of stock-option expense. Based on the pro forma application of SFAS No. 123 for the calculation of stock-option expense prior to January 1, 2006 (as previously disclosed in the company's consolidated financial statements), pro forma after-tax stock-option expense in the first quarter of 2005 was $12 million, or $0.02 per diluted share.

BAXTER--PAGE 8 BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC. CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND CHANGES IN NET DEBT (unaudited) ($ in millions) CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS (Brackets denote cash outflows) CHANGES IN NET DEBT Increase (decrease) (A) The decrease in the debt-to-capital ratio from March 31, 2005 to March 31, 2006 primarily related to the settlement of the company's equity units. In February 2006, the purchase contracts included in the company's equity units matured, and the company issued approximately 35 million common shares in exchange for $1.25 billion. Management used a portion of the cash proceeds to pay down maturing debt. The net-debt-to-capital ratio at March 31, 2005 was calculated in accordance with the company's primary credit agreements, which gave 70% equity credit to the company's $1.25 billion equity units debt outstanding on that date (the majority of which was repurchased and retired in the fourth quarter of 2005). Refer to the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 for additional information regarding the equity units.
