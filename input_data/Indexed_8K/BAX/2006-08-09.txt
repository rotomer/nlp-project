however
     Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers and any person controlling the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, with respect to any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information furnished in writing by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
     Promptly after receipt by any person of notice of any claim or the institution of any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing; , the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under such preceding paragraphs except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under such preceding paragraphs. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it elects (upon notice to the indemnified party), jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party (who shall not, without the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying person). If the indemnifying party shall not have so elected to assume such defense, then, upon request of the indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. If the indemnifying party shall so elect to assume such defense, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party pursuant to this of any legal or other expenses

It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties. Anything hereinabove to the contrary notwithstanding, any reference in this to counsel reasonably satisfactory to, or designated by, the indemnified party shall mean (i) in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the second preceding paragraph, counsel reasonably satisfactory to, or designated by, the Representative on behalf of all parties so indemnified pursuant to such paragraph and (ii) in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the first preceding paragraph, counsel reasonably satisfactory to, or designated by, the Company. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to, or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
provided
however
Section 6
     (b) . If the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) of is unavailable as a matter of law to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefit received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omissions.
CONTRIBUTION
Section 6
     The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this paragraph were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations provided for, in the respective cases, in clauses (i) and (ii) of the immediately
pro rata
 
preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Designated Securities underwritten by such Underwriter and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provision of this paragraph (b) concerning contribution, no indemnifying party shall be required to make contribution in any circumstances in which such party would not have been required to provide indemnification by the terms of paragraph (a). Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by an indemnified party of such party's rights, if any, to receive contribution pursuant to Section 11(f) of the Securities Act or other applicable law. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this section are several, in proportion to the respective amounts of Designated Securities underwritten by each of such Underwriters, and not joint.
     In the event that the indemnifying party is one or more of the Underwriters, then the Representative shall act on behalf of the indemnifying party with respect to receipt of notice, agreement as to retention of separate counsel and consent to settlement, and the indemnified party may rely upon the action of the Representative as binding upon each such indemnifying party for purposes of this section.
     The remedies provided for in this are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights and remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity
Section 6
     SECTION 7. . Each Underwriter of the Designated Securities represents and covenants with the Company that (i) without the consent of the Company it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Designated Securities that would constitute a free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 405, other than (a) a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or (b) any free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 405 that would not be required to be filed with the Commission that is substantially in the form of to the Underwriting Agreement; and (ii) it is not subject to any pending proceeding under Section 8A of the Securities Act with respect to the offering (and will promptly notify the Company if any such proceeding against it is initiated during the Prospectus Delivery Period).
