ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. On October 19, 2006, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2006. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. The press release contains several non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. These measures are used in addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the company's business. Management strongly encourages investors to review the company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share, each excluding special items. Special items are excluded because they are unusual or nonrecurring and accordingly can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period. Management believes that these non-GAAP earnings measures facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor performance, and in setting performance compensation targets. The press release also uses "free cash flow," which is defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and is not a measure defined in accordance with GAAP. This measure is used internally to evaluate the company's cash performance, and management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure to investors in that it provides a representation of the company's cash level available to reduce debt outstanding, pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock or make strategic investments and acquisitions.

Exhibit 99.1 BAXTER REPORTS STRONG EARNINGS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER WITH EPS OF $0.57 PER SHARE BAXTER RAISES FULL-YEAR EPS GUIDANCE DEERFIELD, Ill., Oct. 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Baxter International Inc. (NYSE: BAX) today reported strong growth in earnings for the third quarter driven by accelerated revenue growth, continued improvement in operational performance, expansion of gross and operating margins, and lower interest expense. Baxter's third quarter net income of $374 million increased from $116 million in 2005. Earnings per diluted share of $0.57 increased from $0.18 per diluted share in the prior year period, and were at the high end of the guidance range previously provided by the company of $0.55 to $0.57 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, excluding special items recorded in the prior year period, third quarter net income increased 26 percent from $296 million in 2005 and earnings per diluted share increased 21 percent from $0.47 per diluted share. In the third quarter last year, the company recorded $180 million (or $0.29 per diluted share) for charges associated with the exit of hemodialysis instrument manufacturing and for the tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign earnings. Baxter's worldwide sales totaled $2.6 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 7 percent, or 6 percent excluding the benefit from foreign exchange. Sales within the United States totaled $1.1 billion, an increase of 3 percent over the same period last year, and sales outside of the United States increased 9 percent (or 7 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange) to $1.5 billion in the quarter. Contributing to sales growth was Baxter's BioScience business, with sales of $1.1 billion, an increase of 15 percent. Driving this performance was growth from several products used for the treatment of hemophilia and immune disorders, including ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin-Free Method (rAHF-PFM)] and Baxter's portfolio of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), as well as solid growth from other plasma-based therapies and biosurgery products. Renal sales increased 6 percent to $519 million in the third quarter due to continued gains in peritoneal dialysis patients. Medication Delivery sales declined 1 percent to $950 million as a result of generic drug competition. "I'm particularly pleased with the continued and balanced improvement in margins across all of our businesses. This is a strength of our diversified model, and provides leverage for us to continue to accelerate investments to grow our company," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Baxter. "Over the company's 75-year history, Baxter has pioneered many technological and therapeutic breakthroughs for the benefit of patients worldwide, and with our renewed investments in the company, we expect to continue to drive future benefits and value for both patients and shareholders."
Recent Highlights Baxter has recently announced several initiatives and milestones that leverage the company's unique technology platforms, further expand its global presence and focus its resources and investments on areas that provide long-term strategic value. These include: -- Preliminary results from the company's Phase I/II clinical trial of whole-virus H5N1 influenza candidate vaccine, which suggest that the vaccine is well-tolerated in humans and it can induce antibodies that neutralize widely divergent strains of H5N1. -- Approval from regulatory authorities in Canada and Australia to begin marketing ADVATE. ADVATE is now approved for use in 31 countries around the world. -- Re-launching the COLLEAGUE Infusion Pump in all key markets outside the United States. Baxter has now completed the remediation of the majority of infusion pumps currently in use outside the United States, and is awaiting FDA approval of its corrective action plan in the United States. -- Signing a definitive agreement for the sale of the Transfusion Therapies business for $540 million. Subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, the company expects to close the transaction by the first quarter of 2007. Nine-Month Results For the first nine months of 2006, Baxter's net income totaled $965 million and increased 45 percent, with earnings per diluted share of $1.47, which increased 39 percent. On an adjusted basis, Baxter's net income of $1.0 billion increased 24 percent from $829 million last year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the nine-month period of $1.57 increased 19 percent from $1.32 per diluted share in the prior year period. Details related to charges recorded in both nine-month periods can be found on the supplemental schedule on page 10 of this release. In the nine-month period, Baxter's worldwide sales grew 3 percent to $7.6 billion, up from $7.4 billion last year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, organic sales growth for the first nine months of the year was 4 percent. Domestic sales totaled $3.4 billion, an increase of 3 percent over the same period last year, and international sales grew 4 percent (or 6 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange) to $4.3 billion. Cash flow from operations totaled $1.4 billion for the nine-month period, compared to $1.3 billion in the same period in 2005. Free cash flow (cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures of $336 million through the third quarter of 2006) was $1.1 billion, reflecting an improvement of $50 million from the same period last year.
Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2006 Guidance For full-year 2006, the company expects to achieve organic sales growth of approximately 6 percent, and earnings per diluted share of $2.17 to $2.19, before special items (or $2.07 to $2.09 on a GAAP basis). In addition, the company expects cash flow from operations for full-year 2006 to approach $2.0 billion, with free cash flow in excess of $1.4 billion (after approximately $550 million of anticipated capital expenditures). For the fourth quarter of 2006, the company expects organic sales (excluding the impact of foreign exchange) to grow 7 to 8 percent, and earnings per diluted share of $0.60 to $0.62, before any special items.

This release includes forward-looking statements concerning the company's financial results. The statements are based on assumptions about many important factors, including the following, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: demand for and market acceptance risks for new and existing products, such as ADVATE, and other technologies; future actions of regulatory bodies and other governmental authorities, including the FDA and foreign counterparts that could limit or suspend product development, manufacturing or sales or result in sanctions; product quality or patient safety concerns leading to product recalls, withdrawals, launch delays, litigation, or declining sales; product development risks; inventory reductions or fluctuations in buying patterns by wholesalers or distributors; the impact of geographic and product mix on the company's sales; the impact of competitive products and pricing, including generic competition, drug reimportation and disruptive technologies; reimbursement policies of government agencies and private payers; the availability of acceptable raw materials and component supply; the ability to enforce company patents; patents of third parties preventing or restricting the company's manufacture, sale or use of affected products or technology; failure to obtain necessary consents or to satisfy other closing conditions related to the sale of the Transfusion Therapies business; and other risks identified in the company's most recent filing on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company's website. The company does not undertake to update its forward-looking statements. Financial schedules are attached to this release and available on the company's website.
