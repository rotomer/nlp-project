ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. On January 25, 2007, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2006. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. The press release contains several non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. These measures are used in addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the company's business. Management strongly encourages investors to review the company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per diluted share, each excluding special items. Special items are excluded because they are unusual or nonrecurring and accordingly can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period. Management believes that these non-GAAP earnings measures facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor performance, and in setting performance compensation targets. The press release also uses "free cash flow," which is defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and is not a measure defined in accordance with GAAP. This measure is used internally to evaluate the company's cash performance, and management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure to investors in that it provides a representation of the company's cash level available to reduce debt outstanding, pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock or make strategic investments and acquisitions.

Exhibit 99.1 BAXTER'S FOURTH QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS EXCEED EXPECTATIONS COMPANY ACHIEVES RECORD SALES AND EARNINGS IN 2006 AND PROVIDES POSITIVE FINANCIAL OUTLOOK FOR 2007 DEERFIELD, Ill., Jan. 25 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Baxter International Inc. (NYSE: BAX) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter 2006 and provided its financial outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2007. Summary of Fourth Quarter Results Baxter reported income from continuing operations of $433 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 47 percent over the same period last year, and 14 percent on an adjusted basis. Earnings of $0.66 per diluted share exceeded company guidance of $0.60 to $0.62 per diluted share, and represented an increase of 43 percent on a GAAP basis and 10 percent on an adjusted basis. This performance was a result of strong sales growth, gross margin expansion and lower income tax expense. Worldwide sales totaled $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 11 percent compared to the same period last year. Excluding a 2 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange, sales grew 9 percent and exceeded the company's organic sales growth guidance of 7 to 8 percent. Domestic sales increased 11 percent to $1.2 billion, and international sales also increased 11 percent to $1.5 billion (an increase of 7 percent excluding a 4 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange). All of Baxter's businesses posted strong sales growth in the quarter. Sales within Baxter's BioScience business totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of 18 percent from the same period last year. This growth was driven by record sales of ADVATE, Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin Free Method (rAHF-PFM) for the treatment of hemophilia A, antibody therapy products, including GAMMAGARD LIQUID(TM) [Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)] (IVIG) 10% Solution for the treatment of primary immunodeficiencies, specialty plasma therapeutics and biosurgery products. Medication Delivery sales increased 7 percent to $1.0 billion, with increased sales of infusion systems, intraveneous solutions and parenteral nutrition products, along with accelerated growth in the company's drug delivery business. Renal sales increased 6 percent to $537 million reflecting accelerating gains in peritoneal dialysis patients globally. "We are quite pleased with our strong fourth quarter results and are very well positioned as we move into 2007," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "Of particular importance was our ability to significantly accelerate R&D spending, which is essential to support growth in the coming years." Summary of Full-Year 2006 Results For full-year 2006, Baxter's worldwide sales increased 5 percent to $10.4 billion. Domestic sales totaled $4.6 billion, an increase of 5 percent from last year, while international sales increased 6 percent (with no impact from foreign exchange), to $5.8 billion.
Baxter's reported income from continuing operations totaled $1.4 billion, or $2.13 per diluted share, including special charges of $64 million ($0.10 per diluted share). On an adjusted basis, excluding special charges, the company reported 2006 income from continuing operations of $1.5 billion, or $2.23 per diluted share, an increase of 16 percent over last year. Details of special charges recorded in 2005 and 2006 are outlined in the financial schedules that follow the text of this press release. Cash flow from operations totaled $2.2 billion in 2006, and Baxter generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow (cash flow from operations, less $526 million of capital expenditures). Baxter's full-year cash flow performance exceeded the company's guidance for 2006 of approximately $2.0 billion in cash flow from operations, and free cash flow of $1.4 billion. "We are very pleased with the quality of our earnings results and the progress we have made financially throughout 2006," said Robert M. Davis, Baxter's chief financial officer and treasurer. "We are particularly encouraged with the strength of our cash flow, which is the best indication of our continued focus on working capital management and value creation." Increasing Investments in Research and Development In 2006, the company accelerated its investment in research and development by 15 percent to $614 million, the highest level of investment in the company's 75-year history. "Rededication to science and technology will be an important driver of Baxter's future growth and success," Parkinson continued. "Over the last two years, our R&D organization has made great progress in applying disciplined prioritization and project management processes that are critical to ensuring increased productivity of our pipeline and higher returns for our shareholders." Examples of specific advancements include: -- Initiated a Phase II clinical trial utilizing adult stem cells to treat chronic myocardial ischemia, a severe form of coronary artery disease. This trial leverages Baxter's proprietary technology to select stem cells for the procedure from the patient's own bloodstream. -- Announced preliminary Phase I/II clinical results of Baxter's candidate H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccine, suggesting the vaccine is well tolerated in humans and may provide wider cross protection for a larger number of people before and during a pandemic. This represented the first clinical evaluation of a cell-based H5N1 vaccine, and is the first clinical demonstration that a candidate H5N1 vaccine can induce antibodies that neutralize widely divergent strains of H5N1 virus. -- Supported Phase II clinical trials involving the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) to treat Alzheimer's disease, which are being conducted by researchers at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City. -- Advanced the company's hemophilia portfolio through partnerships with Nektar Therapeutics and Lipoxen Technologies, leveraging each company's expertise to develop new therapies to reduce the frequency of injections required to treat blood-clotting disorders.
-- Initiated a Phase II clinical trial involving the regeneration of bone using a product co-developed by Baxter and Kuros Biosurgery AG. The product is based on a combination of Baxter's TISSEEL fibrin sealant and Kuros' proprietary biologics and associated binding technology. -- Initiated the development of a recombinant form of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a protein critical to the normal clotting of blood. Preclinical results, presented at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December, suggest that Baxter's recombinant VWF therapeutic protein has similar properties to plasma-derived VWF. -- Collaborated with Halozyme Therapeutics in the clinical and commercial development of Hylenex, a liquid injectable formulation of recombinant human hyaluronidase that can simplify the delivery of medications and fluids through the use of subcutaneous infusion. First Quarter and Full-Year 2007 Outlook For full-year 2007, Baxter expects to achieve organic sales growth of 3 to 4 percent. This guidance reflects the divestiture of the Transfusion Therapies business before the end of the first quarter and excludes sales of the company's COLLEAGUE infusion pump in the United States, which may resume before the end of 2007. Excluding Transfusion Therapies revenues in both 2006 and 2007, Baxter expects organic sales growth of approximately 7 percent, reflecting a continued acceleration in sales growth compared to 2006. The company expects earnings for full-year 2007 to be $2.47 to $2.53 per diluted share, and to generate cash flow from operations of approximately $2.3 billion. For the first quarter 2007, the company expects organic sales to grow 5 to 6 percent, and earnings of $0.54 to $0.56 per diluted share. This guidance reflects the divestiture of the Transfusion Therapies business during the first quarter and ongoing transition service revenue to support this business' ongoing operations.
