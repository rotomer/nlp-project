ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. On April 19, 2007, Baxter International Inc. issued an earnings press release for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2007. The press release, including attachments, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. The press release contains non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. These measures are used in addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the company's business. Management strongly encourages investors to review the company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. The non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding special items. Special items are excluded because they are unusual or nonrecurring and accordingly can be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the company's reported operations for a period. Management believes that non-GAAP earnings measures facilitate a fuller analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor performance, and in setting performance compensation targets. ITEM 9.01.

Exhibit 99.1 BAXTER REPORTS STRONG FIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS AND BOOSTS FULL-YEAR OUTLOOK FIRST QUARTER SALES INCREASED 11 PERCENT; EPS OF $0.61 INCREASED 42 PERCENT DEERFIELD, Ill., April 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Baxter International Inc. (NYSE: BAX) today reported sales and earnings above expectations for the first quarter of 2007, and raised its outlook for the full-year. First quarter net income increased 43 percent to $403 million compared to $282 million in the first quarter of 2006. Earnings per diluted share of $0.61 increased 42 percent over the $0.43 per diluted share reported last year. Strong sales, improved margins, and lower interest expense drove the company's financial performance, which compared favorably to the guidance previously provided for the first quarter of $0.54 to $0.56 per diluted share. Baxter's worldwide sales totaled $2.7 billion in the first quarter, an increase of 11 percent. Sales within the United States totaled $1.1 billion, an increase of 8 percent over the same period last year, while sales outside of the United States grew 14 percent (or 8 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange) to $1.5 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, Baxter's sales growth of 8 percent exceeded its guidance range of 5 to 6 percent. During the quarter, momentum continued in Baxter's BioScience business, with revenues totaling $1.1 billion, an increase of 22 percent. This increase was driven by strength across all product lines, including recombinant products used in the treatment of hemophilia A, antibody therapy products for the treatment of primary immunodeficiencies, and other specialty plasma therapeutics and biosurgery products. The company also posted strong vaccine sales in the quarter as a result of shipments of its candidate H5N1 vaccine for government stockpiles around the world, and strong demand in Europe for its vaccines that prevent tick-borne encephalitis and group C meningococcal meningitis. BioScience results exclude the Transfusion Therapies business, which was divested in the quarter. Medication Delivery revenues increased 8 percent to $990 million as a result of strong international performance and sales of anesthesia products. Renal revenues increased 6 percent to $525 million as the company continued to post strong gains in peritoneal dialysis patients, primarily in developing countries. "Our strong first quarter financial results reflect the building momentum in our business and our disciplined focus on driving margin improvements," said Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "This performance continues to reflect the value inherent in optimizing our current business portfolio and allowed us to continue to accelerate our investment in research and development, which grew 15% in the quarter." Second Quarter and Full-Year 2007 Outlook Given strong first quarter financial results, Baxter is raising its sales and earnings outlook for full-year 2007. The company now expects to achieve sales growth of 4 to 5 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and earnings per diluted share of $2.60 to $2.65, before any special items. In addition, Baxter continues to expect cash flow from operations for full-year 2007 to total approximately $2.3 billion. For the second quarter of 2007, Baxter expects sales growth of 3 to 4 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and earnings per diluted share, before any special items, of $0.66 to $0.68.
The financial outlook for the second quarter and full-year 2007 reflects the divestiture of the Transfusion Therapies business and excludes sales of the company's COLLEAGUE infusion pump in the United States, which may resume before the end of 2007.
