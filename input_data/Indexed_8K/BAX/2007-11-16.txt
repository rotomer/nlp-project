Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
     On November 13, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the amendment and restatement of the Company's Bylaws to allow for the issuance of uncertificated shares as well as to make a number of additional modifications. The Company must be able to issue uncertificated shares in order to be eligible for participation in the Direct Registration System (DRS). The additional modifications included the consolidation of the shareholder notice procedures into Section 8 of Article I, the removal of provisions regarding the standing Committees of the Board to avoid overlap with the charters of these Committees, elimination of a provision addressing the Company's purchase of its outstanding shares of common stock, various additions and deletions to streamline the descriptions of the officers of the Company and the addition of provisions covering practices commonly employed under Delaware General Corporation Law such as action without a meeting of the Board of Directors, presence at a meeting and electronic transmission.
     The foregoing summary of the Bylaw amendments is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Company's Bylaws, as amended and restated on November 13, 2007, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
