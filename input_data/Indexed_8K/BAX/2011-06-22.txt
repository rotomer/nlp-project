     (ii) all outstanding Advances on and as of the last Domestic Business Day of each quarter and on any other Business Day elected by the Administrative Agent in its discretion or upon instruction by the Majority Banks.
Each day upon or as of which the Administrative Agent determines Dollar Amounts as described in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) is herein described as a "" with respect to each Advance for which a Dollar Amount is determined on or as of such day. If at any time the Dollar Amount of the sum of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Advances (calculated, with respect to those Advances denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars, as of the most recent Computation Date with respect to each such Advance) the aggregate amount of any L/C Obligations (net of any Reimbursement Obligations that shall have been converted to Syndicated Borrowings) exceeds 105% of the Aggregate Commitments, the Borrower shall immediately repay Advances (and/or cash collateralize any outstanding Letters of Credit) in an aggregate principal amount sufficient to cause the remaining outstanding Advances and L/C Obligations not to exceed the Aggregate Commitments.

The obligation of the Banks to make Eurocurrency Advances and/or EURIBOR Advances, as applicable, in connection with such Notice of Borrowing shall thereupon terminate and each Bank obligated to participate in such Borrowing shall extend a Base Rate Advance to the Borrower in lieu of the originally requested Type of Advance, which Base Rate Advance shall be made on the date specified in the original

Exhibit 6.01(d) to Four-Year Credit Agreement dated as of June 17, 2011
To each of the Banks parties
to the Credit Agreement described below, and to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to of the Four-Year Credit Agreement, dated as of June 17, 2011 (the ""), among Baxter International Inc. (the ""), the Banks parties thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined.
Section 6.01(d)
Credit Agreement
Borrower
          I am Associate General Counsel of the Borrower. I have acted as counsel for the Borrower in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement.
          In that connection I, or attorneys under my supervision (with whom I have consulted) have examined:
          (1) The Credit Agreement;
          (2) The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Borrower as in effect on the date hereof (the "");
Charter
          (3) The Bylaws of the Borrower, as amended and in effect on the date hereof (the ""); and
Bylaws
          (4) Certificates of the Secretaries of State of Delaware, dated ________________, _____, and Illinois, dated __________, _____, each attesting to the continued corporate existence and good standing of the Borrower in such State.
          I, or attorneys under my supervision (with whom I have consulted), have also examined the originals, or copies certified to my satisfaction, of the Borrower's material agreements as identified on the Borrower's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 and any subsequent filings on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (collectively, the ""). In addition, I, or attorneys under my supervision (with whom I have consulted), have examined the originals, or
Material Agreements
 
copies certified to my satisfaction, of such other corporate records of the Borrower, certificates of public officials and of other officers of the Borrower, and agreements, instruments and documents, as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. As to questions of fact material to such opinions, I have, when relevant facts were not independently established by me, relied upon certificates of other officers of the Borrower or of public officials. I have assumed the due execution and delivery, pursuant to due authorization, of the Credit Agreement by the Banks and the Administrative Agent. Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
     1. The Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has all requisite authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which the failure so to qualify would have a material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets, operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower.
     2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement [and the Notes] are within the Borrower's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not contravene (i) the Charter or the Bylaws or (ii) any law, rule or regulation applicable to the Borrower or (iii) any contractual or legal restriction binding on or affecting the Borrower contained in any Material Agreement. The Credit Agreement [and the Notes] have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Borrower.
     3. No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any Governmental Authority or regulatory body is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement [and the Notes].
     4. The Credit Agreement [and the Notes] are legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their respective terms.
     5. Except as disclosed in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, there is no pending or, to my knowledge, threatened action or proceeding against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator which is likely to have a materially adverse effect upon the financial condition or operations of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or which purports to affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement [or the Notes].
     6. The Borrower is not an "investment company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
     The opinions set forth above are subject to the following qualifications:
     (a) My opinion in paragraph 4 above is subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, receivership, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and to the effect of general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). In applying such principles, a court, among other things, might not allow a creditor to accelerate the maturity of a debt upon the
 
occurrence of a default deemed immaterial or might decline to order a debtor to perform covenants. Such principles applied by a court might include a requirement that a creditor act with reasonableness and in good faith. In addition, a court may refuse to enforce a provision of the Credit Agreement if it deems such provision to violate public policy, including any provision indemnifying a person or entity against liability for its own wrongful or negligent acts.
          (b) The opinions expressed herein are limited to the Applicable Laws of the State of Illinois and the United States of America, except for the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware with respect to the opinions given in paragraphs 1 and 2. I do not express any opinion herein concerning any other law. For purposes of the opinion given in paragraph 4 it is assumed, with your permission, that the governing law is in all relevant respects identical to the laws of the State of Illinois. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, I express no opinion as to the effect upon the obligations of the Borrower of (i) any law of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York (assuming such law is in all relevant respects identical to the laws of the State of Illinois) wherein the Agent or any Bank may be located or wherein enforcement of the Credit Agreement may be sought, (ii) the compliance or noncompliance by the Agent or any Bank with any laws or regulations applicable to it because of its legal or regulatory status or the nature of its business, or (iii) any failure of the Agent or any Bank to be authorized to conduct business in any applicable jurisdiction.
          (c) I express no opinion as to (i) and of the Credit Agreement insofar as they provide that any Bank purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant thereto may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such participation or that any Affiliate of a Bank may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such Bank's claims under the Credit Agreement [or the Notes], (ii) or insofar as those Sections may be construed as requiring that the Borrower indemnify any Bank or the Administrative Agent with respect to any claim, damage, liability or expense incurred as a result of any violation of law by such Bank or the Administrative Agent, and (iii) the effect of the law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Illinois wherein any Bank may be located or wherein enforcement of the Credit Agreement [or the Notes] may be sought which limits the rates of interest legally chargeable or collectible.
Sections 5.17
11.05
Sections 5.15(c)
11.04(c)
          For the purposes of this opinion, the term "Applicable Laws" means those laws, rules and regulations that in my experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Credit Agreement, without having made any special investigation as to the applicability of any specific law, rule or regulation.
          This opinion is limited to the matters expressly set forth herein, and no opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond the matters expressly set forth herein. The opinions expressed herein are being delivered to you in connection with the transactions described hereinabove and are solely for your benefit in connection with the transactions described hereinabove and may not be relied on in any manner or for any purpose by any other person, nor any copies published, communicated or otherwise made available in whole or in part to any other person or entity without our specific prior written consent, except that you may furnish copies thereof (i) to any of your permitted successors and assigns in respect of the Credit Agreement, (ii) to your independent auditors and attorneys, (iii) upon the request of any state or federal
 
authority or official having regulatory jurisdiction over you, and (iv) pursuant to order or legal process of any court or governmental agency.
          The opinions expressed herein are being delivered to you as of the date hereof and are based solely on factual matters in existence as of the date hereof and laws and regulations in effect on the date hereof. I assume no obligation to revise or supplement this opinion letter should factual matters changes or should such laws or regulations be changed by legislative or regulatory action, judicial decision or otherwise.
Very truly yours,
