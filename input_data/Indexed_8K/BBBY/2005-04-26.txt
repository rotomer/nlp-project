Item 1.01               Entry into A Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Historically, the Company has used stock options for all equity incentive awards to its executive officers.  At the Company's 2004 annual meeting, shareholders approved the Company's 2004 Incentive Compensation Plan, providing for awards of restricted stock as well as grants of stock options.  On April 20, 2005, the Compensation Committee made awards to executive officers consisting of a combination of restricted stock and stock option grants.  Consistent with past practice, the stock options granted to these executives will vest over time, subject, in general, to the executive's remaining in the Company's employ on specified vesting dates.  Vesting of the restricted stock awarded to these executives will be dependent on (i) the Company's achievement of a performance-based test for the fiscal year of grant, and (ii) assuming achievement of the performance-based test, time vesting, subject, in general, to the executive remaining in the Company's employ on specified vesting dates.
