Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On March 22, 2007, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing the acquisition of Buy Buy Baby, Inc. ("Baby"). A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
On March 22, 2007, the Company entered into a definitive agreement for and simultaneously closed on the purchase of Baby, a privately held retailer of infant and toddler merchandise, for approximately $67 million (net of cash acquired) and repayment of debt of approximately $19 million. Based in Garden City, New York, Baby operates a total of eight stores in New York, New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia. The stores range in size from 28,000 to 60,000 square feet and offer a broad assortment of premier infant and toddler merchandise in categories including furniture, car seats, strollers, feeding, bedding, bath, health and safety essentials, toys, learning and development products, clothing and a unique selection of seasonal and holiday products.
Baby was founded in 1996 by Richard and Jeffrey Feinstein, both of whom were previously employed by the Company and are the sons of Leonard Feinstein, one of the Company's Co-Chairmen.  They will remain with Baby and continue to run its operations.  The acquisition was approved by a special committee of independent members of the Board of Directors of the Company. The special committee retained Merrill Lynch & Co. to serve as its independent financial advisor and render a fairness opinion in connection with the transaction, as well as Chadbourne & Parke LLP to serve as independent legal counsel to oversee the acquisition negotiations.  The Company's Co-Chairmen, Leonard Feinstein and Warren Eisenberg, recused themselves from deliberations relating to the transaction.
Of the approximately $19 million of indebtedness repaid in connection with the transaction, approximately $16 million was held by Richard and Jeffrey Feinstein and approximately $3 million was held by Leonard Feinstein.  Richard and Jeffrey Feinstein, and Leonard Feinstein and his wife, have provided personal guaranties in respect of certain of Baby's leases.  In connection with this transaction, the sellers negotiated to have the Company, as sole and controlling owner of Baby, assume these obligations. Therefore, under the terms of the purchase agreement, the Company has agreed to offer the landlords under these leases substitute guaranties from the Company on substantively the same terms as the existing personal guaranties, and to indemnify such guarantors against liability under the guaranties if the substitute guaranties are not accepted by the landlords.  The landlord of one of the Baby stores is an entity owned by the families of Richard and Jeffrey Feinstein; in connection with the transaction, the lease for that store was amended to make its terms more consistent with the Company's standard lease terms.
