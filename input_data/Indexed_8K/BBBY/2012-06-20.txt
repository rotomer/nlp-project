Exhibit 99.1
 
            
Net Earnings per Diluted Share of $.89
            
Quarterly Net Sales Increase by Approximately 5.1%
            
Quarterly Comparable Store Sales Increase by Approximately 3.0%
            
Modeling Fiscal Second Quarter 2012 Net Earnings per Diluted Share of Approximately $.97 to $1.03
            
Continues to Model Fiscal 2012 Net Earnings per Diluted Share to Increase by a High Single to a Low Double Digit Percentage Range
 
UNION, New Jersey, June 20, 2012  today reported net earnings of $.89 per diluted share ($206.8 million) in the fiscal quarter ended May 26, 2012, an increase of approximately 24% versus net earnings of $.72 per diluted share ($180.6 million) in the same quarter a year ago.  Net sales for the fiscal first quarter of 2012 were approximately $2.218 billion, an increase of approximately 5.1% from net sales of approximately $2.110 billion reported in the fiscal first quarter of 2011.  Comparable store sales in the fiscal first quarter of 2012 increased by approximately 3.0%, compared with an increase of approximately 7.0% in last year's fiscal first quarter.
Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.
 
During the fiscal first quarter of 2012, the Company repurchased approximately $306 million of its common stock representing approximately 4.6 million shares.  As of May 26, 2012, the remaining balance of the current share repurchase program authorized in December 2010 was approximately $613 million.
 
The Company is modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $.97 to $1.03 for the fiscal second quarter and continues to model net earnings per diluted share to increase by a high single to a low double digit percentage range for all of fiscal 2012, which will be 53 weeks.  The modeling of net earnings per diluted share is based upon a number of planning assumptions which will be described in the Company's first quarter of fiscal 2012 conference call. Information regarding access to the call is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website, www.bedbathandbeyond.com.
 
As announced on May 9, 2012, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Cost Plus, Inc., a retailer selling a wide range of home decorating items, furniture, gifts, holiday and other seasonal items, and gourmet food and beverages.  While the Company expects the tender offer for Cost Plus, Inc.'s outstanding shares to be completed during the fiscal second quarter, the Company's planning assumptions and modeled net earnings per diluted share for the fiscal second quarter and full year 2012 exclude Cost Plus, Inc. as the transaction has not yet been completed.
 
Assuming the tender offer is completed as anticipated during the fiscal second quarter of 2012, the Company's modeling of net earnings per diluted share, including transaction and integration costs, would decrease by several cents for the fiscal second quarter.  For the fiscal second half, net earnings per diluted share, including integration costs, would increase and be slightly accretive.  For fiscal 2012, the Company would continue to model net earnings per diluted share to increase by a high single to a low double digit percentage range over fiscal 2011.
 
Additionally, on June 1, 2012, the Company announced the acquisition of Linen Holdings, LLC, a business-to-business distributor of a variety of textile products, amenities and other goods to customers in the hospitality, cruise line, food service, healthcare and other industries.  The benefit from Linen Holdings, LLC's results of operations is included in the Company's modeled net earnings per diluted share and will not have a material effect for the fiscal second quarter or for all of fiscal 2012.
 
As of May 26, 2012, the Company had a total of 1,180 stores, including 995 stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada, 72 stores, 68 stores and 45 stores under the names of or .  During the fiscal first quarter, the Company opened two stores, four stores and one store. Consolidated store space as of May 26, 2012 was approximately 36.3 million square feet.  Since the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2012 on May 27, 2012, the Company has opened two stores and three stores.  In addition, the Company is a partner in a joint venture which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name "."
