     Total noninterest income was $404.1 million for the second quarter of 2002, an increase of 21.1% compared with the same period in 2001. This increase was primarily driven by service charges on deposits, investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions and agency insurance commissions.
     Income from service charges on deposit accounts totaled $101.5 million for the second quarter, an increase of 15.3% compared with the same period in 2001. This increase resulted from growth in deposit accounts, higher transaction volume and income from acquisitions.
     Investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions totaled $56.0 million for the quarter, an increase of 30.6% compared with the second quarter last year.
