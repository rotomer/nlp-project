Merger-related charges for the fourth quarter of 2002 totaled $6.5 million on an after-tax basis. The charges resulted primarily from the acquisitions and systems integrations of MidAmerica Bancorp, AREA Bancshares Corporation and F&M National Corporation.
          BB&T's fourth quarter 2002 annualized returns on average assets and average shareholders' equity were 1.71% and 17.97%, respectively. Excluding merger-related charges, the annualized returns on average assets and average shareholders' equity were 1.74% and 18.32%, respectively.
          Cash basis operating results exclude the effects of intangible assets and related amortization expenses, as well as merger-related charges. Cash basis operating earnings totaled $345.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2002. These results reflect an increase of 13.5% compared with the prior year. Cash basis operating earnings for the current quarter produced an annualized return on average tangible assets of 1.79%, and an annualized return on average tangible shareholders' equity of 24.58%.
          For the year ended Dec. 31, 2002, BB&T's net income was $1.303 billion, or $2.72 per diluted share. Merger-related charges had the effect of reducing earnings per share by $.03 for the year. Net income and earnings per share reflect increases of 33.8% and 28.3%, respectively, compared with 2001.
          Operating earnings for the year ended Dec. 31, 2002 totaled $1.318 billion, an increase of 19.8% compared to 2001. These results exclude $24.7 million in charges resulting from mergers and acquisitions, and $9.8 million in income resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standard.
          "I am very pleased to report record operating earnings for both the fourth quarter of 2002 and the full year," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John A. Allison. "Our results for 2002 mark the 21 consecutive year that BB&T has achieved record performance. This accomplishment is all the more remarkable in light of the challenging business environment of the last two years. Our success was driven by a strong performance from our noninterest income generating businesses and continued healthy net interest margins.
st
          "Our outlook for 2003 is optimistic, although there remain many challenges and uncertainties with respect to economic conditions in our markets," said Allison. "Assuming the economy recovers in the second half of 2003, we are comfortable with current estimates from analysts who report through First Call and project that we will earn between $2.95 and $3.05 per diluted share in 2003.
          "BB&T continues to be a rewarding investment," continued Allison. "During 2002, our total return to shareholders was 5.5%, while the S&P 500 Index decreased 22.1%. Our three year return was 13.9% compared to a decrease of 14.5% for the S&P. BB&T's five year total return was 5.6%, compared with a decrease of .6% for the S&P 500, and the 10 year compound annual total return to shareholders was 17.6% for BB&T, while the S&P increased 9.3% for the 10 year period."
Noninterest Income Businesses Produce Strong Growth
          Noninterest income growth was a primary driver of performance during the fourth quarter of 2002. Total noninterest income was $491.4 million for the quarter, an increase of 34.4% compared with the same period in 2001. The primary components of this increase were mortgage banking income, insurance commissions and investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions.
          Mortgage banking income totaled $137.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2002, an increase of $98.6 million compared to mortgage banking income from the fourth quarter last year. This substantial increase results from the high volume of mortgage origination activity during the year and resulting increases in origination and servicing fee income. BB&T originated a record $14.1 billion of mortgage loans during 2002, compared to $10.5 billion last year. In the fourth quarter, BB&T originated $5.5 billion, up almost 60% compared to the fourth quarter last year.
          BB&T's revenues from insurance operations totaled $87.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, up 75.8% compared with the fourth quarter last year. This significant increase results principally from insurance agencies purchased during 2002, the largest of which was the purchase of CRC Insurance Services, Inc., the nation's largest independent wholesale insurance brokerage firm. In addition to growth resulting from acquisitions, BB&T enjoyed internal growth of approximately 18%.
          Investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions totaled $53.7 million for the quarter, an increase of 19.2% compared with the fourth quarter last year. This increase resulted from higher fixed income securities underwriting fees, retail brokerage fees and investment banking income.
BB&T Receives Recognition as Industry Leader
          BB&T's commitments to client service and employee benefits lead the banking industry according to the results of recent studies by highly regarded financial publications. For the fifth consecutive year, BB&T is one of the top two "small business friendly" financial holding companies in the nation according to the U.S. Small Business Administration. In a separate survey, BB&T was named by J.D. Power as the No. 1 bank in home mortgage customer satisfaction. Finally, BB&T is the second highest ranked bank in magazine's survey of "Corporate America's Best Benefits."
Money
          "We are extremely gratified to be recognized for these achievements," said Allison. "Our success begins with our people. We work hard to hire excellent employees, and train and reward them to enable BB&T to offer world standard service to all of our clients."
Net Interest Income Increases 12%
          Net interest income totaled $708.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2002, an increase of $76.0 million, or 12.0% compared to the prior year. The net interest margin was 4.22% in the fourth quarter, up from 4.20% for the fourth quarter last year. For the full year, the net interest margin was 4.25%, an increase of 7 basis points compared to 4.18% in 2001.
Asset Quality Remains Strong
          BB&T's total nonperforming assets, as a percentage of total assets, increased slightly comparing December 31, 2002 and 2001, while net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans decreased modestly in the fourth quarter of 2002 compared to the same period in 2001. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were ..56% at Dec. 31, 2002, up from .53% at the end of 2001, but relatively stable compared to the last four quarters. Annualized net charge-offs were .51% of average loans and leases for the fourth quarter of 2002, compared with .54% for the fourth quarter last year. Excluding losses at BB&T's specialized lending subsidiaries, annualized net charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2002 were .41% of average loans and leases.

This press release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). BB&T's management uses these non-GAAP measures in their analysis of the Company's performance. These measures typically adjust GAAP performance measures to exclude the effects of charges, expenses and gains related to the consummation of mergers and acquisitions, and costs related to the integration of merged entities, as well as the amortization of intangibles in the case of "cash basis" performance measures. These non-GAAP measures may also exclude other significant gains or losses that are unusual in nature or are associated with acquiring and converting merged entities. Since these items and their impact on BB&T's performance are difficult to predict, management believes presentations of financial measures excluding the impact of these items provide useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the operating results of BB&T's core businesses. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures which may be presented by other companies.
