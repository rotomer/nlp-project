FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BB&T posts record operating results for 2003; operating earnings up 9.6% in the fourth quarter
Merger charges and nonrecurring items cause 9.6% decrease in net income
          WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.  BB&T Corporation (NYSE: BBT) today reported earnings for the fourth quarter and the full year 2003. For the fourth quarter, net income totaled $305.0 million, or $.55 per diluted share. These results reflect decreases of 9.6% and 21.4%, respectively, compared with $337.3 million and $.70 per diluted share earned during the fourth quarter of 2002. The current period performance was negatively affected by merger-related expenses principally associated with the acquisition of First Virginia Banks, Inc., and a one-time charge related to deferred income taxes associated with BB&T's leasing operations, which collectively totaled $71.8 million on an after-tax basis.
          Excluding the effects of the merger-related expenses and the one-time charge, operating earnings totaled $376.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, an increase of 9.6% compared to 2002. Diluted operating earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $.69, a decrease of 4.2% compared with $.72 earned during the same period last year.
          BB&T's fourth quarter 2003 net income produced annualized returns on average assets and average shareholders' equity of 1.34% and 11.98%, respectively. On an operating basis, the annualized returns on average assets and average shareholders' equity were 1.66% and 14.80%, respectively.
          Cash basis operating results exclude the effects of intangible assets and related amortization expenses, net amortization of purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments, merger-related charges and nonrecurring items. Cash basis operating earnings totaled $393.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, an increase of 13.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2002. Fourth quarter cash basis diluted earnings per share were $.72, equal to the amount earned in the fourth quarter last year.
          Cash basis operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2003 produced an annualized return on average tangible assets of 1.81% and an annualized return on average tangible shareholders' equity of 25.84%.
          For the full year 2003, net income totaled $1.1 billion, or $2.07 per diluted share. These results reflect decreases of 18.3% and 23.9%, respectively, compared to 2002. Excluding merger-related charges and nonrecurring items, operating earnings for 2003 totaled $1.4 billion, an increase of 8.0% compared with the prior year, and operating earnings per diluted share were $2.77, an increase of 0.7% compared to 2002.
          "BB&T realized many significant accomplishments during 2003," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John A. Allison. "We have made a number of important investments for the future, particularly our acquisition of First Virginia, the largest bank merger in our history, our pending acquisition of McGriff, Seibels & Williams, the largest insurance acquisition in our history, and our pending merger with Republic Bancshares, which will greatly enhance our franchise in Florida.
          "While we are reasonably pleased with our overall performance for 2003 and confident about our opportunities for the future, slow commercial loan demand in our core markets and the integration of recent acquisitions have slowed the pace of our earnings growth and will continue to do so into 2004," said Allison. "Based on current internal forecasts, we project diluted operating earnings per share in the range of $2.85 to $2.95 for 2004, which equates to a range of $2.99 to $3.09 on a cash basis." Calculated on a basis consistent with generally accepted accounting principles, management projects net income per diluted share for 2004 in the range of $2.81 to $2.91.
BB&T Again Named Nation's #1 Small Business Lender
          For the fourth time in six years, the U.S. Small Business Administration has named BB&T the nation's top "small business-friendly" lender. The annual ranking recognizes the financial institution from which small businesses were most successful in obtaining loans, and is an important measure of how well banks are meeting the credit needs of small businesses.
Noninterest Expenses Decrease Significantly
          BB&T's noninterest expenses totaled $682.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 excluding $51.5 million in merger-related charges. Compared to the third quarter of 2003, noninterest expenses decreased 15.2% at an annualized rate excluding acquisitions. This decrease reflects initial cost savings and efficiencies from the recently completed acquisition of First Virginia as well as lower personnel costs resulting from slowed mortgage banking activity. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2002, noninterest expenses decreased 4.0% excluding the impact of acquisitions.
BB&T's Noninterest Income Benefits from Solid Performances in Major Business Lines
          BB&T's noninterest income generating businesses continued to experience overall growth despite a substantial decrease in income from mortgage banking. Total noninterest income was $471.0 million for the quarter, an increase of 3.2% compared with the same period in 2002. This increase was produced by solid growth from insurance commissions, investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions, fees from deposit-related services and other nondeposit fees and commissions.
          The growth in BB&T's insurance agency network and insurance brokerage operations remained particularly strong with commissions increasing 16.5% to $102.1 million compared with $87.6 million earned during the fourth quarter of 2002. The growth in commission revenue resulted from both acquisitions and strong internal growth.
          BB&T's investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions totaled $68.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, an increase of 26.6% compared to the $53.7 million earned in the fourth quarter last year. The increase resulted primarily because of growth in brokerage commissions and revenues from sales of annuities.
          Income from service charges on deposits totaled $122.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2003, an increase of 15.5% compared to the $105.7 million earned in the fourth quarter of 2002. BB&T's total number of transaction accounts increased 26.1% during 2003, partially because of acquisitions, creating the increase in service charge income.
          Other nondeposit fees and commissions increased 26.6% to $73.6 million in the fourth quarter compared with the same quarter last year. This growth resulted primarily from higher bankcard income, which increased 25.5%, and fees from electronic payment services.
Asset Quality Remains Strong
          BB&T's credit quality continued to improve during the fourth quarter and remains very strong. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were .49% at Dec. 31, 2003, equal to the ratio at Sept. 30, 2003, but down from .56% at Dec. 31, 2002. Annualized net charge-offs were .42% of average loans and leases for the fourth quarter of 2003, down from .51% in the fourth quarter of 2002. Excluding losses at BB&T's specialized lending subsidiaries, annualized net charge-offs for the current quarter were .31% of average loans and leases compared to .40% for the same period in 2002. For the full year 2003, net charge-offs were .43% of average loans and leases, down from .48% in 2002.
BB&T Expands in Fast-Growing Markets and Profitable Business Lines
          On Oct. 13, 2003, BB&T successfully completed the systems conversion of the eight subsidiary banks acquired through the merger with First Virginia Banks, Inc., and on Oct. 14, 2003, more than 300 banking offices of the former First Virginia opened as BB&T branches. The acquisition of First Virginia substantially increased BB&T's market share in many of the most economically attractive markets in Virginia, Maryland, Washington, D.C., and Tennessee.
          On Dec. 2, 2003, BB&T announced plans to acquire Republic Bancshares Inc. ("Republic"), headquartered in St. Petersburg, Fla. Republic has $2.8 billion in assets and operates 71 banking offices along the Gulf Coast and in central and southern Florida, including key markets in Tampa, Clearwater, Orlando, West Palm Beach, Boca Raton and Fort Lauderdale. The merger would be BB&T's second in Florida following the acquisition of Regional Financial Corp. in Sept. 2002. These acquisitions represent the initial steps in BB&T's plans to expand and build a strong presence in Florida, one of America's fastest growing and economically dynamic states.
          On Nov. 11, 2003, BB&T Insurance Services announced plans to acquire McGriff, Seibels & Williams Inc. ("MSW") of Birmingham, Ala., the largest privately held commercial insurance broker headquartered in the Southeast and the second largest in the United States. MSW specializes in large commercial and energy accounts, including many Fortune 500 companies, and its areas of expertise include energy and marine, financial services, commercial, construction, surety, employee benefits, healthcare and public entities. The acquisition of MSW will complement and diversify BB&T's insurance operations and is expected to substantially increase BB&T's revenues from insurance operations. Following the completion of this acquisition, which is expected in the first quarter of 2004, BB&T Insurance Services will be the sixth largest insurance broker in the nation.
          "Given the economic challenges of the last two years, we felt it was very important to expand and diversify our company to prepare for the future," said Allison. "The acquisition of these companies will provide tremendous opportunities for growth and enhanced profitability as we integrate our products and sales system throughout the excellent First Virginia and Republic markets and utilize the national insurance presence provided through the McGriff acquisition."
          At Dec. 31, 2003, BB&T had $90.5 billion in assets and operated more than 1,350banking offices in the Carolinas, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Georgia, Maryland, Tennessee, Florida, Alabama, Indiana and Washington, D.C. BB&T's common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol BBT. The closing price of BB&T's common stock on Jan.12 was $37.79 per share.

This press release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). BB&T's management uses these non-GAAP measures in their analysis of the Company's performance. These measures typically adjust GAAP performance measures to exclude the effects of charges, expenses and gains related to the consummation of mergers and acquisitions, and costs related to the integration of merged entities, as well as the amortization of intangibles and purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments in the case of "cash basis" performance measures. These non-GAAP measures may also exclude other significant gains, losses or expenses that are unusual in nature and not expected to recur. Since these items and their impact on BB&T's performance are difficult to predict, management believes presentations of financial measures excluding the impact of these items provide useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the operating results of BB&T's core businesses. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.
