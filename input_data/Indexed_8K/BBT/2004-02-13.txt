FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BB&T's corporate board votes to amend expiration date of stockholder rights plan
           The Board of Directors of BB&T Corporation (NYSE: BBT) has voted to amend BB&T's shareholder rights plan to accelerate the final expiration date of the purchase rights issued under the plan.
WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. 
          Under the terms of the amendment, the purchase rights will now expire at the close of business March 1, 2004, rather than Dec. 31, 2006, as initially provided under the plan. The rights plan will terminate upon the expiration of the purchase rights.
          This action was taken in response to new corporate governance initiatives recommended by corporate governance rating organizations.
