Cash basis operating earnings totaled $422.5 million for the second quarter of 2004, an increase of 23.9% compared to the second quarter of 2003.

          "I am extremely pleased to report strong results for the second quarter of 2004," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John A. Allison. "Our earnings reflect significant improvements in a number of key areas that drive our performance, including core loan growth, higher revenues from our noninterest income generating businesses, continued excellent asset quality and improving expense control. We are also gaining sales and earnings momentum in our new markets and achieving operating efficiencies from recent acquisitions. I believe we are well-positioned to further improve profitability during the remainder of 2004."
          For the first six months of 2004, BB&T's net income was $728.6 million, an increase of 13.1% compared to $644.0 million earned in the first six months of 2003.

Excluding the impact of growth resulting from acquisitions, average loans grew 12.3% on an annualized basis compared to the first quarter of 2004, reflecting the strongest internal quarterly growth rate since 2000.

Core Operating Noninterest Expenses Decrease 6.8%
          BB&T's noninterest expenses totaled $750.7 million for the second quarter, an increase of $12.7 million, or 6.9% on an annualized basis, compared to the first quarter of 2004. Excluding merger-related expenses and expense growth resulting from purchase acquisitions, noninterest expenses decreased 6.8% on an annualized basis compared to the first quarter of 2004, demonstrating efficiencies realized in connection with recent mergers.
Growth Continues in Noninterest Income
          The positive trends in BB&T's noninterest income continued during the second quarter. Total noninterest income was $573.7 million for the quarter, an increase of 24.4% compared with the same period in 2003. Excluding growth resulting from acquisitions, noninterest income increased 4.4% compared to the second quarter of 2003. Noninterest income for the second quarter of 2004 increased at an 80.3% annualized rate compared to the first quarter of 2004, and grew an annualized 56.9%, excluding acquisitions, compared to the same period. The growth was led by substantially improved performance from mortgage banking operations, as well as increased revenues from insurance operations, service charges on deposit accounts and other nondeposit fees and commissions.
          Revenues from mortgage banking operations totaled $67.5 million for the second quarter of 2004, an increase of $100.2 million compared to a net loss of $32.7 million for the second quarter last year. Current quarter earnings increased primarily as a result of a $30.4 million net recapture of the valuation allowance offsetting mortgage servicing rights as higher mortgage rates have increased the value of these assets. Lower interest rates in the second quarter of 2003 required BB&T to record a $109.3 million increase to the allowance for mortgage servicing rights, resulting in the $32.7 million net loss.
          The continued expansion of BB&T's insurance agency network and brokerage operations through both acquisitions and internal growth resulted in insurance commissions totaling $164.7 million for the second quarter, a 62.3% increase compared with $101.5 million earned during the second quarter of 2003. Revenues from BB&T's insurance operations were the largest source of noninterest income during the quarter. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, second quarter insurance commissions increased 8.4% compared to the second quarter of 2003 and 54.3% on an annualized basis compared to the first quarter of 2004.
          Service charges for deposit-related services totaled $131.4 million during the second quarter of 2004, an increase of 36.0% compared to the second quarter of 2003. This increase resulted from service charge income from acquired institutions, growth in commercial account analysis fees and significantly lower fee waivers compared to last year. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, service charges on deposits for the second quarter of 2004 increased 12.6% compared to the second quarter last year.
          Other service charges, commissions and fees totaled $79.5 million for the second quarter of 2004, an increase of $18.7 million, or 30.8%, compared to the second quarter of 2003. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, other service charges, commissions and fees increased 12.2% compared to the second quarter last year. This increase was generated primarily by growth in bankcard fees and merchant-related services.

This press release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). BB&T's management uses these non-GAAP measures in their analysis of the Company's performance. These measures typically adjust GAAP performance measures to exclude the effects of charges, expenses and gains related to the consummation of mergers and acquisitions, and costs related to the integration of merged entities, as well as the amortization of intangibles and purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments in the case of "cash basis" performance measures. These non-GAAP measures may also exclude other significant gains, losses or expenses that are unusual in nature and not expected to recur. Since these items and their impact on BB&T's performance are difficult to predict, management believes presentations of financial measures excluding the impact of these items provide useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the operating results of BB&T's core businesses. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.
