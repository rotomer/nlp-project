BB&T reports record net income of $412.9 million
 
WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.  BB&T Corporation (NYSE: BBT) reported today record third quarter net income totaling $412.9 million, or $.74 per diluted share, compared with $115.9 million, or $.21 per diluted share, earned in the third quarter of 2003. These results reflect increases of 256.3% and 252.4%, respectively, compared to the third quarter last year. Net income and diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2003 reflect $248.5 million in after-tax losses resulting from an early extinguishment of debt and $14.8 million in net after-tax merger-related charges.
 
Operating earnings for the third quarter of 2004 totaled $410.9 million, or $.74 per diluted share, excluding $2.0 million in net after-tax merger-related gains, which were primarily related to sales of facilities. Excluding the effects of merger-related items and nonrecurring charges from both 2004 and 2003, operating earnings and operating diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2004 increased 8.3% and 8.8%, respectively, compared with the third quarter of 2003.
 
BB&T's third quarter net income produced annualized returns on average assets and average shareholders' equity of 1.69% and 15.42%, respectively, compared to prior year returns of .51% and 4.50%, respectively.
 
Cash basis operating results exclude the unamortized balances of intangibles from assets and shareholders' equity and exclude the amortization of intangibles, the net amortization of purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments and merger-related items from earnings. Cash basis operating earnings totaled $430.2 million for the third quarter of 2004, an increase of 8.6% compared to the third quarter of 2003. Current quarter cash basis diluted earnings per share increased 8.5% to $.77, compared to $.71 earned during the same period in 2003. Cash basis operating earnings for the third quarter of 2004 produced an annualized return on average tangible assets of 1.85% and an annualized return on average tangible shareholders' equity of 28.50%.
 
"I am very pleased to report strong results for the third quarter of 2004," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John A. Allison. "Building on momentum from the second quarter, our results reflect continued improvement in our already excellent asset quality and an increase in our net interest margin. I am also very pleased with our progress in becoming a more efficient company. Our third quarter cash basis efficiency ratio was our strongest in almost three years and reflects the successful integration of past mergers and the implementation of internal cost control initiatives. We also grew our noninterest income generating businesses and are seeing reasonably strong growth in commercial and consumer loans. Given these trends, I remain optimistic about our future performance."
 
For the first nine months of 2004, BB&T's net income was $1.14 billion, an increase of 50.2% compared to $759.9 million earned in the first nine months of 2003. Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of 2004 totaled $2.05 compared to $1.51 earned in 2003. Excluding $4.5 million in net after-tax merger-related charges from 2004 and $287.1 million in net after-tax merger-related and nonrecurring charges from 2003, operating earnings for the first nine months of 2004 were $1.15 billion, an increase of 9.5% compared to operating earnings in 2003. Operating diluted earnings per share totaled $2.06 for the first nine months of 2004.
 
Asset Quality Remains Excellent  Improves Further in 3
rd
Quarter
 
BB&T's asset quality continued to improve during the third quarter and remains very strong compared to the industry. Nonperforming assets, as a percentage of total assets, decreased to .40% at Sept. 30, compared to .42% at June 30 and .49% at Sept. 30, 2003. Annualized net charge-offs were ..34% of average loans and leases for the third quarter of 2004, equal to the .34% achieved in the second quarter of 2004 and down from .40% in the third quarter of 2003. These levels of nonperforming assets and quarterly net charge-offs are the lowest experienced by BB&T in more than three years. Excluding losses at BB&T's specialized lending subsidiaries, annualized net charge-offs for the current quarter were .19% of average loans and leases compared to .24% in the second quarter of 2004 and .30% in the third quarter of 2003.
 
Average Loans Grow 8.7%
 
Average loans and leases totaled $66.9 billion for the third quarter of 2004, an increase of 8.7% compared to the third quarter of 2003. Excluding the impact of growth resulting from acquisitions and a $1.0 billion mortgage loan securitization completed during the third quarter, average loan growth was 6.5% compared to the third quarter of 2003. This growth was led by consumer loans, which increased 8.0%, excluding the impact of acquisitions, compared to the third quarter of 2003, and commercial loans, which grew 6.0%, excluding acquisitions, compared to the third quarter last year.
 
Noninterest Expenses Decline  Reflecting the Integration of Past Mergers
 
BB&T's noninterest expenses totaled $716.6 million for the third quarter, a decrease of $34.0 million compared to the second quarter of 2004. Excluding merger-related items and growth resulting from purchase acquisitions, noninterest expenses declined 7.1% compared to the third quarter of 2003. The decline in noninterest expenses resulted in a cash basis operating efficiency ratio of 48.8% for the third quarter of 2004, the lowest level achieved in almost three years.
 
Growth in Noninterest Income Remains Solid
 
BB&T's noninterest income generating businesses continued to show overall growth in the third quarter of 2004 despite a significant decline in income from mortgage banking. Total noninterest income was $538.9 million for the third quarter of 2004, an increase of 5.2% compared with the same period in 2003. Excluding fluctuations in income from mortgage banking and securities gains and losses, noninterest income increased 19.0% compared with last year. The growth was led by increased revenues from insurance operations, service charges on deposit accounts and other nondeposit fees and commissions.
 
The continued expansion of BB&T's insurance agency network and brokerage operations through both acquisitions and internal growth resulted in insurance commissions totaling $163.4 million for the third quarter, a 57.7% increase compared with $103.6 million earned during the third quarter of 2003. Revenues from BB&T's insurance operations were the largest source of noninterest income during the quarter. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, third quarter insurance commissions from BB&T's agency and brokerage operations increased 6.8% compared to the third quarter of 2003.
 
Service charges for deposit-related services totaled $135.5 million during the third quarter of 2004, an increase of 11.1% compared to the third quarter of 2003. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, service charges on deposits for the third quarter of 2004 increased 9.8% compared to the third quarter last year.
 
Other service charges, commissions and fees totaled $82.8 million for the third quarter of 2004, an increase of $9.5 million, or 12.9%, compared to the third quarter of 2003. This increase was generated primarily by growth in bankcard fees, merchant-related services and debit card related services. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, other service charges, commissions and fees increased 11.9% compared to the third quarter last year.
 
Revenues from mortgage banking operations totaled $28.1 million for the third quarter of 2004, a decrease of $70.2 million compared to $98.3 million for the third quarter last year. Current quarter earnings include a $5.0 million net write-down of the valuation allowance offsetting mortgage servicing rights, as lower mortgage rates have decreased the value of these assets. This is compared to a $69.8 million net recapture recorded in the third quarter of 2003, when rates for mortgages were rising.
 
Income Taxes
 
BB&T's operating provision for income taxes totaled $206.9 million for the third quarter of 2004, an increase of 25.4% compared with the third quarter last year. The increase reflects a rise in BB&T's effective tax rate, which was 33.5% on an operating basis in the third quarter of 2004.
 
BB&T also announced today the filing of a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Greensboro, N.C. to pursue a refund of $3.3 million in taxes plus interest assessed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to a leveraged lease transaction entered into by BB&T during 1997. BB&T paid this assessment during 2003 and filed a refund claim which was denied by the IRS in the second quarter of 2004. Management continues to believe that BB&T's treatment of this transaction was appropriate and in compliance with the tax law and regulations applicable to 1997 and has determined that this action is necessary in order to protect BB&T's interests.
 
At Sept. 30, BB&T had $97.9 billion in assets and operated more than 1,400 banking offices in the Carolinas, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Georgia, Maryland, Tennessee, Florida, Alabama, Indiana and Washington, D.C. BB&T's common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol BBT. The closing price of BB&T's common stock on Oct. 13 was $39.49 per share.

This press release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). BB&T's management uses these non-GAAP measures in their analysis of the Company's performance. These measures typically adjust GAAP performance measures to exclude the effects of charges, expenses and gains related to the consummation of mergers and acquisitions, and costs related to the integration of merged entities, as well as the amortization of intangibles and purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments in the case of "cash basis" performance measures. These non-GAAP measures may also exclude other significant gains, losses or expenses that are unusual in nature and not expected to recur. Since these items and their impact on BB&T's performance are difficult to predict, management believes presentations of financial measures excluding the impact of these items provide useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the operating results of BB&T's core businesses. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements as defined by federal securities laws. These statements may address issues that involve significant risks, uncertainties, estimates and assumptions made by management. Actual results could differ materially from current projections. Please refer to BB&T's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a summary of important factors that could affect BB&T's forward-looking statements.
