Compensation
                    a.       For all services rendered by the Employee to the Employer and BB&T under this Agreement, the Employer or BB&T shall pay to the Employee, during the Term, a minimum annual base salary at a rate not less than $260,000, payable in accordance with the standard payroll practices and procedures of the Employer or BB&T applicable to all officers. Any salary increase payable to the Employee shall be determined in accordance with the Employer's or BB&T's annual salary plan, and shall be based on the Employer's and/or BB&T's performance and the performance of the Employee.
                    b.       The Employee shall continue to participate in any bonus or incentive plans, whether any such plan provides for awards in cash or securities, made available to officers similarly situated to the Employee, as such plan or plans may be modified from time to time, or such other similar plans for which the Employee may become eligible and designated a participant.
                    c.       Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, for as long as the Employee is employed by the Employer and BB&T, the Employee also shall be entitled to receive, on the same basis as other similarly situated officers of the Employer or BB&T, employee pension and welfare benefits and group employee benefits such as sick leave, vacation, group disability and health, life, and accident insurance and similar indirect compensation which the Employer or BB&T may from time to time extend to its officers.
                    d.       If, during the Term, the Employee becomes eligible for benefits under the Pension Plan and retires, the Employee shall be eligible to participate in the same retiree health care program provided to other retiring employees at the time. During the Compensation Continuance Period, the Employee shall be deemed to be an "active employee" of the Employer for purposes of participating in the Employer's or BB&T's health care plan and for purposes of satisfying any age and service requirements under the Employer's or BB&T's retiree health care program. Thus, if the Employee has not satisfied either the age or service requirement (or both) under the Employer's or BB&T's retiree health care program at the time payment of his Termination Compensation begins, but satisfies the age or service requirement (or both) at the time such Termination Compensation payments end, he shall be deemed to have satisfied the age or service requirement (or both) for purposes of the Employer's or BB&T's retiree health care program as of the date his Termination Compensation payments end. For purposes of satisfying any service requirement under the Employer's or BB&T's retiree health care program, the Employee shall be credited with one year of service for each Computation Period which begins and ends during the Compensation Continuance Period.

                    a.      To the extent and subject to the limitations provided in the following subsections of this Section 6 (whichever subsection may be applicable), upon termination of the Employee's employment for any reason, including but not limited to the expiration of the Term, the Employee shall not directly or indirectly, either as a principal, agent, employee, employer, stockholder, co-partner or in any other individual or representative capacity whatsoever, engage in the banking and financial services business, which includes, but it is not limited to, consumer, savings, commercial banking and the insurance and trust businesses, or the savings and loan or mortgage banking business, or any other business in which the Employer, BB&T or their Affiliates are engaged, anywhere in the States of North Carolina and South Carolina and in any county outside of North Carolina and South Carolina contiguous to North Carolina or South Carolina, nor shall the Employee solicit, or assist any other Person in so soliciting, any depositors or customers of the Employer, BB&T or their Affiliates, or induce any then or former employees to terminate their employment with the Employer, BB&T or their Affiliates, except that this Section 6a shall not be read to prohibit the investment described in the last sentence of Section 9.

However, if the Employee terminates his employment with the Employer or BB&T for Good Reason within twelve (12) months after a Change of Control or, if later, within ninety (90) days after a MOE Revocation (as defined in Section 2b), subparagraph c below shall apply, not this subparagraph b.
shall
                    c.

shall
not
                    d.      If the Employee terminates his employment with the Employer or BB&T for any reason other than Good Reason at any time (except within twelve (12) months after a Change of Control, or, if later, within ninety (90) days after a MOE Revocation), the Employee be subject to the non-competition and non-solicitation provisions of Section 6a.
shall
                    e.      If the employment of the Employee is terminated by the Employer or BB&T at any time for Just Cause, the Employee be subject to the non-competition and non-solicitation provisions of Section 6a.
shall not
                    f.      If the employment of the Employee is terminated by the Employer or BB&T for any reason other than Just Cause at any time (except within twelve (12) months after a Change of Control, or, if later, within ninety (90) days after a MOE Revocation), the Employee be subject to the non-competition and non-solicitation provisions of Section 6a until the earlier of: (i) the first anniversary of the Employee's Termination Date; or (ii) the date as of which the Employee ceases to receive any further Termination Compensation because of his breach of the non-competition or non-solicitation provisions of Section 6a.

                    g.      During the Term and at any time thereafter, and except as required by any court, supervisory authority or administrative agency or as may be otherwise required by applicable law, the Employee shall not, without the written consent of the Boards of Directors of the Employer and BB&T, or a person authorized thereby, disclose to any person, other than an employee of the Employer, BB&T or an Affiliate thereof, or a person to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection with the performance by the Employee of his duties as an employee of the Employer or BB&T, any Confidential Information obtained by him while in the employ of the Employer or BB&T, unless such information has become a matter of public knowledge at the time of such disclosure.
                    h.      The covenants contained in this Section 6 shall be construed and interpreted in any judicial proceeding to permit their enforcement to the maximum extent permitted by law. The Employee agrees that the restraints imposed in this Section 6 are necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of the Employer, BB&T and their Affiliates and that each and every one of the restraints is reasonable in respect to such matter, length of time and the area. The Employee further acknowledges that damages at law would not be a measurable or adequate remedy for breach of the covenants contained in this Section 6 and, accordingly, the Employee agrees to submit to the equitable jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction in connection with any action to enjoin the Employee from violating any such covenants.
           If, by reason of a physical or mental disability during the Term, the Employee is unable to carry out the essential functions of his employment pursuant to this Agreement for twelve (12) consecutive months, his employment hereunder may be terminated by action of the Board of Directors of the Employer or BB&T determining to do so upon one month's notice to be given to the Employee at any time after the period of twelve (12) consecutive months of disability and while such disability continues. If, prior to the expiration of the one-month period after the giving of such notice, the Employee shall recover from such disability and return to the full-time active discharge of his duties hereunder, then such notice shall be of no further force and effect and the Employee's employment shall continue as if the same had been uninterrupted. If the Employee shall not so recover from his disability and return to his duties, then his employment shall terminate on the date which coincides with the expiration of such one month's notice. During the first twelve (12) consecutive months of the period of the Employee's disability, the Employee shall continue to earn all compensation (including bonuses and incentive compensation) to which the Employee would have been entitled as if he had not been disabled, such compensation to be paid at the time, in the amounts, and in the manner provided in Section 5a, inclusive of any compensation received pursuant to any applicable disability insurance plan of the Employer or BB&T. Thereafter, the Employee shall receive compensation to which he is entitled under any applicable disability insurance plan of the Employer or BB&T. In the event a dispute arises between the Employee and the Employer or BB&T concerning the Employee's physical or mental disability or ability to continue or return to the performance of his duties as aforesaid, the Employee shall submit, at the expense of the Employer and BB&T, to examination by a competent physician mutually agreeable to the parties, and his opinion as to the Employee's capability to so perform shall be final and binding. Upon termination of the Employee's employment by reason of disability, the Term shall end.

Termination; Termination Compensation and Other Post Termination Benefits
                    a.      If the Employee shall die during the Term, this Agreement and the employment relationship hereunder shall automatically terminate on the date of death, which date shall be his Termination Date, and, thus, the last day of the Term.
                    b.      The Employer or BB&T shall have the right to terminate the Employee's employment under this Agreement at any time for Just Cause upon written notice to the Employee as provided in subparagraph i below. In the event the employment of the Employee is terminated by the Employer or BB&T for Just Cause, the Employee shall have no right to receive compensation (such as Termination Compensation) or other benefits (including the special SERP enhancement benefits described in Section 8f) under this Agreement for any period after such termination.
                    c.      The Employer or BB&T may terminate the Employee's employment under this Agreement other than for Just Cause at any time upon written notice to the Employee as provided in subparagraph i below. In the event the Employer or BB&T terminates the employment of the Employee under this Agreement pursuant to this subparagraph c, the Employee shall be entitled to the following compensation and benefits:
The Termination Compensation and other benefits provided for in this subparagraph c shall be paid by the Employer or BB&T in accordance with the standard payroll practices and procedures in effect prior to the Employee's Termination Date. If the Employee breaches any of the covenants set forth in Section 6a of this Agreement prior to the first anniversary of his Termination Date, the Employee shall not be entitled to receive any further Termination Compensation or benefits pursuant to this Section 8c from and after the date of such breach.
                    d.       If (i) the employment of the Employee is terminated for any reason other than Just Cause or the Employee's death, regardless of whether the Employer or BB&T or the Employee initiates such termination, within twelve (12) months after a Change of Control (or, if later, within ninety (90) days after a MOE Revocation), or (ii) the Employee terminates his employment at any time for Good Reason, the Employee shall be entitled to the following compensation and benefits:
The Termination Compensation and other benefits provided for in this subparagraph d shall be paid by the Employer or BB&T in accordance with the standard payroll practices and procedures in effect prior to the Employee's Termination Date, a Change of Control or MOE Revocation, as appropriate. In accordance with Section 6b, if the Employee terminates his employment at any time for Good Reason (except within twelve (12) months after a Change of Control, or, if later, within ninety (90) days after a MOE Revocation), the Employee shall be subject to the covenants set forth in Section 6a for the one-year period following his Termination Date. If the Employee breaches Section 6a of this Agreement prior to the first anniversary of his Termination Date, the Employee shall not be entitled to receive any further Termination Compensation or benefits pursuant to this Section 8d from and after the date of such breach.
Should the circumstances of the termination of the employment of the Employee result in application of both subparagraphs c and d, subparagraph d shall be deemed to apply and control.
                    e.       If the Employee terminates his employment for any reason other than Good Reason and such termination does not occur within twelve (12) months after a Change of Control (or, if later, within ninety (90) days after a MOE Revocation), he shall not be entitled to compensation (such as Termination Compensation) or other benefits (including the special SERP enhancement benefits described in Section 8f) under this Agreement for any period after such termination.
                    f.       The Employee is a participant in the BB&T Corporation Non-Qualified Defined Benefit Plan (the "SERP"). The SERP was formerly known as the Branch Banking and Trust Company Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. The SERP is a non-qualified, unfunded supplemental retirement plan which provides benefits to or on behalf of selected key management employees. The benefits provided under the SERP supplement the retirement and survivor benefits payable from the Pension Plan. Except in the event the employment of the Employee is terminated by the Employer or BB&T for Just Cause and except in the event the Employee terminates his employment for any reason other than Good Reason and such termination does not occur within twelve (12) months after a Change of Control (or, if later, within ninety (90) days after a MOE Revocation), the following special provisions shall apply for purposes of this Agreement:
Attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A are several SERP calculations. The purpose of these calculations is to illustrate the application and effect of this subparagraph f.
                    g.       In receiving any payments pursuant to this Section 8, the Employee shall not be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Employee hereunder and such amounts shall not be reduced or terminated whether or not the Employee attains other employment.
                    h.       In the event that any amount paid or distributed to the Employee pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and the aggregate of such parachute payments and any other amounts paid or distributed to the Employee from any other plans or arrangements maintained by the Employer, BB&T, or their Affiliates shall cause the Employee to be subject to the Excise Tax, the Employer shall pay to the Employee an additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the net amount the Employee shall receive after the payment of any Excise Tax shall equal the amount which he would have received if the Excise Tax had not been imposed. The Gross-Up Payment shall be determined by BB&T's regular independent auditors and shall equal the sum of the following:
For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, the Employee shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation for individuals in the calendar year in which the Excise Tax is required to be paid. In addition, the Employee shall be deemed to pay state income taxes at a rate determined in accordance with the following formula:
In the event the Employee is subject to the provisions of Section 68 of the Code, the combined federal and state income tax rate determined above shall be adjusted to reflect any loss in the federal deduction for state income taxes on the Gross-Up Payment.
The Gross-Up Payment shall be paid to the Employee by the Employer or BB&T on or before the date that the Employee is required to pay the Excise Tax; provided, however, that if the amount of such payment cannot be finally determined on or before such day, the Employer or BB&T shall pay to the Employee on such day an estimate, as determined in good faith by BB&T's regular independent auditors, of the minimum amount of such payment and shall pay the remainder of such payment (together with interest at the rate provided under Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) as soon as the amount can be determined but no later than the thirtieth (30th) day after the date the Employee becomes subject to the payment of the Excise Tax. In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently determined to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder at the time the Gross-Up Payment is made, the Employee shall repay to the Employer or BB&T, as applicable, at the time that the amount of such reduction in Excise Tax is finally determined, the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to such reduction (plus the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax, federal and state taxes imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by the Employee, if such repayment results in a reduction in Excise Tax and/or a federal or state tax deduction) plus interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code. In the event that the Excise Tax is determined to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder at the time the Gross-Up Payment is made (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the Employer or BB&T shall make an additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest payable with respect to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined. The parties agree that the intent of this subparagraph h is that the Employee shall be reimbursed for the Excise Tax on his excess parachute payments and all taxes on that reimbursement. The intended goal is to place the Employee in the same economic position as if no Excise Tax had been imposed.
                    i.       A termination of the Employee's employment by BB&T, the Employer or the Employee for any reason other than death shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other parties hereto. For this purpose, a Notice of Termination means a written notice which specifies the effective date of termination.
           The Employee shall devote all of his business time, attention, knowledge and skills solely to the business and interests of the Employer, BB&T and their Affiliates. The Employer, BB&T and their Affiliates shall be entitled to all of the benefits, profits and other emoluments arising from or incident to all work, services and advice of the Employee, and the Employee shall not, during the Term, become interested, directly or indirectly, in any manner, as a partner, officer, director, stockholder, advisor, consultant, employee or in any other capacity in any other business similar to the business of the Employer, BB&T and their Affiliates. Nothing contained in this Section 9 shall be deemed, however, to prevent or limit the right of the Employee to invest in a business similar to the business of the Employer, BB&T and their Affiliates if such investment is limited to less than one (1) percent of the capital stock or other securities of any corporation or similar organization whose stock or securities are publicly owned or are regularly traded on any public exchange.

Compensation
                    a. For all services rendered by the Employee to the Employer and BB&T under this Agreement, the Employer or BB&T shall pay to the Employee, during the Term, a minimum annual base salary at a rate not less than $260,000, payable in accordance with the standard payroll practices and procedures of the Employer or BB&T applicable to all officers. Any salary increase payable to the Employee shall be determined in accordance with the Employer's or BB&T's annual salary plan, and shall be based on the Employer's and/or BB&T's performance and the performance of the Employee.
                     b. The Employee shall continue to participate in any bonus or incentive plans, whether any such plan provides for awards in cash or securities, made available to officers similarly situated to the Employee, as such plan or plans may be modified from time to time, or such other similar plans for which the Employee may become eligible and designated a participant.

If, during the Term, the Employee becomes eligible for benefits under the Pension Plan and retires, the Employee shall be eligible to participate in the same retiree health care program provided to other retiring employees at the time.

Thus, if the Employee has not satisfied either the age or service requirement (or both) under the Employer's or BB&T's retiree health care program at the time payment of his Termination Compensation begins, but satisfies the age or service requirement (or both) at the time such Termination Compensation payments end, he shall be deemed to have satisfied the age or service requirement (or both) for purposes of the Employer's or BB&T's retiree health care program as of the date his Termination Compensation payments end. For purposes of satisfying any service requirement under the Employer's or BB&T's retiree health care program, the Employee shall be credited with one year of service for each Computation Period which begins and ends during the Compensation Continuance Period.

                     b. If the Employee terminates his employment with the Employer or BB&T for Good Reason at any time, the Employee shall be subject to the non-competition and non-solicitation provisions of Section 6a until the earlier of: (i) the first anniversary of the Employee's Termination Date; or (ii) the date as of which the Employee ceases to receive any further Termination Compensation because of his breach of the non-competition or non-solicitation provisions of Section 6a. However, if the Employee terminates his employment with the Employer or BB&T for Good Reason within twelve (12) months after a Change of Control or, if later, within ninety (90) days after a MOE Revocation (as defined in Section 2b), subparagraph c below shall apply, not this subparagraph b.

shall
                    e. If the employment of the Employee is terminated by the Employer or BB&T at any time for Just Cause, the Employee shall not be subject to the non-competition and non-solicitation provisions of Section 6a.
                    f. If the employment of the Employee is terminated by the Employer or BB&T for any reason other than Just Cause at any time (except within twelve (12) months after a Change of Control, or, if later, within ninety (90) days after a MOE Revocation), the Employee be subject to the non-competition and non-solicitation provisions of Section 6a until the earlier of: (i) the first anniversary of the Employee's Termination Date; or (ii) the date as of which the Employee ceases to receive any further Termination Compensation because of his breach of the non-competition or non-solicitation provisions of Section 6a. If the employment of the Employee is terminated by the Employer or BB&T for any reason other than Just Cause within twelve (12) months after a Change of Control, or, if later, within ninety (90) days after a MOE Revocation), the Employee be subject to the non-competition and non-solicitation provisions of Section 6a.

                     h. The covenants contained in this Section 6 shall be construed and interpreted in any judicial proceeding to permit their enforcement to the maximum extent permitted by law. The Employee agrees that the restraints imposed in this Section 6 are necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of the Employer, BB&T and their Affiliates and that each and every one of the restraints is reasonable in respect to such matter, length of time and the area. The Employee further acknowledges that damages at law would not be a measurable or adequate remedy for breach of the covenants contained in this Section 6 and, accordingly, the Employee agrees to submit to the equitable jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction in connection with any action to enjoin the Employee from violating any such covenants.
            If, by reason of a physical or mental disability during the Term, the Employee is unable to carry out the essential functions of his employment pursuant to this Agreement for twelve (12) consecutive months, his employment hereunder may be terminated by action of the Board of Directors of the Employer or BB&T determining to do so upon one month's notice to be given to the Employee at any time after the period of twelve (12) consecutive months of disability and while such disability continues. If, prior to the expiration of the one-month period after the giving of such notice, the Employee shall recover from such disability and return to the full-time active discharge of his duties hereunder, then such notice shall be of no further force and effect and the Employee's employment shall continue as if the same had been uninterrupted. If the Employee shall not so recover from his disability and return to his duties, then his employment shall terminate on the date which coincides with the expiration of such one month's notice. During the first twelve (12) consecutive months of the period of the Employee's disability, the Employee shall continue to earn all compensation (including bonuses and incentive compensation) to which the Employee would have been entitled as if he had not been disabled, such compensation to be paid at the time, in the amounts, and in the manner provided in Section 5a, inclusive of any compensation received pursuant to any applicable disability insurance plan of the Employer or BB&T. Thereafter, the Employee shall receive compensation to which he is entitled under any applicable disability insurance plan of the Employer or BB&T. In the event a dispute arises between the Employee and the Employer or BB&T concerning the Employee's physical or mental disability or ability to continue or return to the performance of his duties as aforesaid, the Employee shall submit, at the expense of the Employer and BB&T, to examination by a competent physician mutually agreeable to the parties, and his opinion as to the Employee's capability to so perform shall be final and binding. Upon termination of the Employee's employment by reason of disability, the Term shall end.

                    b. The Employer or BB&T shall have the right to terminate the Employee's employment under this Agreement at any time for Just Cause upon written notice to the Employee as provided in subparagraph i below.

                    c. The Employer or BB&T may terminate the Employee's employment under this Agreement other than for Just Cause at any time upon written notice to the Employee as provided in subparagraph i below.

The Termination Compensation and other benefits provided for in this subparagraph c shall be paid by the Employer or BB&T in accordance with the standard payroll practices and procedures in effect prior to the Employee's Termination Date. If the Employee breaches any of the covenants set forth in Section 6a of this Agreement prior to the first anniversary of his Termination Date, the Employee shall not be entitled to receive any further Termination Compensation or benefits pursuant to this Section 8c from and after the date of such breach.
                     d. If (i) the employment of the Employee is terminated for any reason other than Just Cause or the Employee's death, regardless of whether the Employer or BB&T or the Employee initiates such termination, within twelve (12) months after a Change of Control (or, if later, within ninety (90) days after a MOE Revocation), or (ii) the Employee terminates his employment at any time for Good Reason, the Employee shall be entitled to the following compensation and benefits:
The Termination Compensation and other benefits provided for in this subparagraph d shall be paid by the Employer or BB&T in accordance with the standard payroll practices and procedures in effect prior to the Employee's Termination Date, a Change of Control or MOE Revocation, as appropriate. In accordance with Section 6b, if the Employee terminates his employment at any time for Good Reason (except within twelve (12) months after a Change of Control, or, if later, within ninety (90) days after a MOE Revocation), the Employee shall be subject to the covenants set forth in Section 6a for the one-year period following his Termination Date. If the Employee breaches Section 6a of this Agreement prior to the first anniversary of his Termination Date, the Employee shall not be entitled to receive any further Termination Compensation or benefits pursuant to this Section 8d from and after the date of such breach.
Should the circumstances of the termination of the employment of the Employee result in application of both subparagraphs c and d, subparagraph d shall be deemed to apply and control.
                    e. If the Employee terminates his employment for any reason other than Good Reason and such termination does not occur within twelve (12) months after a Change of Control (or, if later, within ninety (90) days after a MOE Revocation), he shall not be entitled to compensation (such as Termination Compensation) or other benefits (including the special SERP enhancement benefits described in Section 8f) under this Agreement for any period after such termination.
                    f. The Employee is a participant in the BB&T Corporation Non-Qualified Defined Benefit Plan (the "SERP").

The SERP is a non-qualified, unfunded supplemental retirement plan which provides benefits to or on behalf of selected key management employees. The benefits provided under the SERP supplement the retirement and survivor benefits payable from the Pension Plan. Except in the event the employment of the Employee is terminated by the Employer or BB&T for Just Cause and except in the event the Employee terminates his employment for any reason other than Good Reason and such termination does not occur within twelve (12) months after a Change of Control (or, if later, within ninety (90) days after a MOE Revocation), the following special provisions shall apply for purposes of this Agreement:
Attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A are several SERP calculations. The purpose of these calculations is to illustrate the application and effect of this subparagraph f.
                    g. In receiving any payments pursuant to this Section 8, the Employee shall not be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Employee hereunder and such amounts shall not be reduced or terminated whether or not the Employee attains other employment.
                    h. In the event that any amount paid or distributed to the Employee pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and the aggregate of such parachute payments and any other amounts paid or distributed to the Employee from any other plans or arrangements maintained by the Employer, BB&T, or their Affiliates shall cause the Employee to be subject to the Excise Tax, the Employer shall pay to the Employee an additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the net amount the Employee shall receive after the payment of any Excise Tax shall equal the amount which he would have received if the Excise Tax had not been imposed. The Gross-Up Payment shall be determined by BB&T's regular independent auditors and shall equal the sum of the following:
                    (1) The rate of the Excise Tax multiplied by the amount of the excess parachute payments;
                    (2) Any federal income tax, social security tax, unemployment tax or Excise Tax imposed upon the Employee as a result of the Gross-Up Payment required to be made under this subparagraph h.; and
          (3) Any state income or other tax imposed upon the Employee as a result of the Gross-Up Payment required to be made under this subparagraph h.
For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, the Employee shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation for individuals in the calendar year in which the Excise Tax is required to be paid. In addition, the Employee shall be deemed to pay state income taxes at a rate determined in accordance with the following formula:
In the event the Employee is subject to the provisions of Section 68 of the Code, the combined federal and state income tax rate determined above shall be adjusted to reflect any loss in the federal deduction for state income taxes on the Gross-Up Payment.
The Gross-Up Payment shall be paid to the Employee by the Employer or BB&T on or before the date that the Employee is required to pay the Excise Tax; provided, however, that if the amount of such payment cannot be finally determined on or before such day, the Employer or BB&T shall pay to the Employee on such day an estimate, as determined in good faith by BB&T's regular independent auditors, of the minimum amount of such payment and shall pay the remainder of such payment (together with interest at the rate provided under Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) as soon as the amount can be determined but no later than the thirtieth (30th) day after the date the Employee becomes subject to the payment of the Excise Tax. In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently determined to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder at the time the Gross-Up Payment is made, the Employee shall repay to the Employer or BB&T, as applicable, at the time that the amount of such reduction in Excise Tax is finally determined, the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to such reduction (plus the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax, federal and state taxes imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by the Employee, if such repayment results in a reduction in Excise Tax and/or a federal or state tax deduction) plus interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code. In the event that the Excise Tax is determined to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder at the time the Gross-Up Payment is made (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the Employer or BB&T shall make an additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest payable with respect to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined. The parties agree that the intent of this subparagraph h is that the Employee shall be reimbursed for the Excise Tax on his excess parachute payments and all taxes on that reimbursement. The intended goal is to place the Employee in the same economic position as if no Excise Tax had been imposed.
                    i. A termination of the Employee's employment by BB&T, the Employer or the Employee for any reason other than death shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other parties hereto. For this purpose, a Notice of Termination means a written notice which specifies the effective date of termination.
           The Employee shall devote all of his business time, attention, knowledge and skills solely to the business and interests of the Employer, BB&T and their Affiliates. The Employer, BB&T and their Affiliates shall be entitled to all of the benefits, profits and other emoluments arising from or incident to all work, services and advice of the Employee, and the Employee shall not, during the Term, become interested, directly or indirectly, in any manner, as a partner, officer, director, stockholder, advisor, consultant, employee or in any other capacity in any other business similar to the business of the Employer, BB&T and their Affiliates. Nothing contained in this Section 9 shall be deemed, however, to prevent or limit the right of the Employee to invest in a business similar to the business of the Employer, BB&T and their Affiliates if such investment is limited to less than one (1) percent of the capital stock or other securities of any corporation or similar organization whose stock or securities are publicly owned or are regularly traded on any public exchange.
