FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BB&T reports 2004 net income of $1.56 billion, up 46.3%; surpasses $100 billion in assets
          WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.  BB&T Corporation (NYSE: BBT) reported today earnings for the fourth quarter and the full year 2004. For the fourth quarter, net income totaled $416.9 million, or $.75 per diluted share, compared with $305.0 million, or $.55 per diluted share, earned during the fourth quarter of 2003. These results reflect increases of 36.7% and 36.4%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2003. Net income and diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2003 were negatively affected by merger-related and nonrecurring expenses, which collectively totaled $71.8 million on an after-tax basis.
          BB&T's fourth quarter net income produced annualized returns on average assets and average shareholders' equity of 1.68% and 15.21%, respectively, compared to prior year returns of 1.34% and 11.98%, respectively.
          Operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2004 totaled $415.8 million, or $.75 per diluted share, excluding $1.1 million in net after-tax merger-related gains. Excluding the effects of merger-related items and nonrecurring charges from both 2004 and 2003, operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2004 increased 10.3% compared with the fourth quarter of 2003. Diluted operating earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2004 increased 8.7% compared to the fourth quarter last year.
          Cash basis operating results exclude the unamortized balances of intangibles from assets and shareholders' equity and exclude the amortization of intangibles, the net amortization of purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments, merger-related charges and nonrecurring items from earnings. Cash basis operating earnings totaled $438.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, or $.79 per diluted share, which represent increases of 11.3% and 9.7%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2003. Cash basis operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2004 produced an annualized return on average tangible assets of 1.86% and an annualized return on average tangible shareholders' equity of 27.77%.
          For the full year 2004, BB&T's net income was $1.56 billion, an increase of 46.3% compared to $1.06 billion earned in 2003. Diluted earnings per share for 2004 totaled $2.80 compared to $2.07 earned in 2003. Excluding $3.5 million in net after-tax merger-related charges from 2004 and $358.9 million in net after-tax merger-related and nonrecurring charges from 2003, operating earnings for 2004 were $1.56 billion, an increase of 9.7% compared to operating earnings of $1.42 billion in 2003. Diluted operating earnings per share totaled $2.81 for 2004 compared to $2.77 in 2003.
          "I am very pleased to report record earnings for 2004," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John A. Allison. "2004 marks the 23 consecutive year that BB&T has achieved record operating earnings. In addition to our earnings growth, we met substantially all of our key strategic objectives in 2004. We increased our ratio of fee-based revenues to total revenues, improved our already excellent asset quality, and became a more efficient company as evidenced by improvement in our cash basis efficiency ratio. Our company also reached a notable milestone by surpassing $100 billion in assets in the fourth quarter. I am optimistic about our opportunities for continued growth in 2005 as we work to become more productive and further integrate the new markets we entered through past acquisitions."

          "I am also pleased that our improved performance has been reflected in our returns to investors," continued Allison. "During the fourth quarter, BB&T's stock reached an all-time high and our 2004 returns to investors outperformed the market. Our total return to shareholders during 2004 was 12.7%, exceeding the S&P 500 Index, which increased 10.8% during the year. Likewise our five- and ten-year compound annual total returns to shareholders have been 12.5% and 19.4%, respectively, outperforming the S&P 500 Index, which provided compound annual total returns of -2.3% and 12.1%, respectively."
Asset Quality Remains Excellent
          BB&T's asset quality remained strong during the fourth quarter and continues to compare favorably to the industry. Nonperforming assets, as a percentage of total assets, decreased to .36% at Dec. 31, 2004 compared to .40% at Sept. 30, 2004 and .49% at Dec. 31, 2003. Annualized net charge-offs were .38% of average loans and leases for the fourth quarter of 2004, down from the .42% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2003. Excluding losses at BB&T's specialized lending subsidiaries, annualized net charge-offs for the current quarter were .27% of average loans and leases compared to .31% in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the full year 2004, net charge-offs were .36% of average loans and leases, down from ..43% in 2003.
Average Loans Grow 9.3%
          Average loans and leases totaled $67.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2004, an increase of 9.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2003. Excluding the impact of growth resulting from acquisitions and a $1.0 billion mortgage loan securitization completed during the third quarter of 2004, average loan growth was 8.1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2003. This growth was led by average mortgage loans, which increased 11.1%, average consumer loans, which increased 7.6% and average commercial loans, which grew 7.2%, compared to the fourth quarter last year.
Noninterest Expenses Decrease  Reflecting Further Improvement in Efficiency
          BB&T's noninterest expenses totaled $710.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, a decrease of $19.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2003. Excluding merger-related items and growth resulting from purchase acquisitions, noninterest expenses declined 4.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2003. The decline in noninterest expenses resulted in a cash basis operating efficiency ratio of 47.8% for the fourth quarter of 2004, marking the third consecutive quarter this ratio has improved. For the full year, noninterest expenses, excluding the impact of acquisitions, decreased 2.4%.
Solid Growth in Noninterest Income
          BB&T's noninterest income demonstrated solid growth during the fourth quarter. Total noninterest income was $548.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, an increase of 17.4% compared with the same period in 2003. Excluding fluctuations in income from mortgage banking and securities gains and losses, noninterest income increased 20.4% compared with the same quarter last year. Higher revenues from BB&T's insurance operations as well as growth in income from service charges on deposit accounts and other nondeposit fees and commissions were the primary drivers of this growth.
          BB&T's insurance operations remained strong, as insurance commissions increased 63.9% to $167.3 million in the current quarter compared with $102.1 million earned during the fourth quarter of 2003. Revenues from BB&T's insurance operations were the largest source of noninterest income during the quarter.
          Service charges for deposit-related services totaled $133.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2004, an increase of 9.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2003. This increase resulted primarily from growth in commercial account analysis fees and significantly lower fee waivers compared to last year. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, service charges on deposits for the fourth quarter of 2004 increased 8.1% compared to the fourth quarter last year.
          Other nondeposit fees and commissions totaled $84.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, an increase of $11.1 million, or 15.1%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2003. This increase was generated primarily by growth in bankcard fees and debit card related services. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, other nondeposit fees and commissions increased 14.1% compared to the fourth quarter last year.
          Revenues from mortgage banking operations totaled $26.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, a decrease of $14.5 million, compared to the fourth quarter last year. The primary cause for the decrease was the fluctuation in the valuation for mortgage servicing rights compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. Current quarter revenues include a net recapture of the valuation for mortgage servicing rights, including hedging activities, of $4.0 million compared to a $20.1 million net recapture in the fourth quarter of 2003.

This press release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). BB&T's management uses these non-GAAP measures in their analysis of the Company's performance. These measures typically adjust GAAP performance measures to exclude the effects of charges, expenses and gains related to the consummation of mergers and acquisitions, and costs related to the integration of merged entities, as well as the amortization of intangibles and purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments in the case of "cash basis" performance measures. These non-GAAP measures may also exclude other significant gains, losses or expenses that are unusual in nature and not expected to recur. Since these items and their impact on BB&T's performance are difficult to predict, management believes presentations of financial measures excluding the impact of these items provide useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the operating results of BB&T's core businesses. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.
          
This press release contains forward-looking statements as defined by federal securities laws. These statements may address issues that involve significant risks, uncertainties, estimates and assumptions made by management. Actual results could differ materially from current projections. Please refer to BB&T's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a summary of important factors that could affect BB&T's forward-looking statements.
