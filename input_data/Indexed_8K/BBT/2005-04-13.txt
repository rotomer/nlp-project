FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BB&T's 1 quarter net income up 20.4%
st
          WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.  BB&T Corporation (NYSE: BBT) reported today net income for the first quarter of 2005 totaling $395.4 million, or $.71 per diluted share. These results reflect increases of 20.4% and 18.3%, respectively, compared to net income of $328.5 million, or $.60 per diluted share, earned in the first quarter of 2004.
          BB&T's first quarter net income produced annualized returns on average assets and average shareholders' equity of 1.60% and 14.70%, respectively, compared to prior year returns of 1.43% and 12.93%, respectively.
          Operating earnings for the first quarter of 2005 totaled $393.8 million, or $.71 per diluted share, excluding $1.6 million in net after-tax merger-related gains. Excluding the effects of merger-related items from both years, operating earnings for the first quarter of 2005 increased 17.7% compared with the first quarter of 2004. Diluted operating earnings per share for the first quarter of 2005 increased 16.4% compared to the first quarter last year.
          Cash basis operating results exclude the unamortized balances of intangibles from assets and shareholders' equity and exclude the amortization of intangibles, the net amortization of purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments, and merger-related and nonrecurring items from earnings. Cash basis operating earnings totaled $415.8 million for the first quarter of 2005, an increase of 17.1% compared to the first quarter of 2004. Current quarter cash basis diluted earnings per share increased 17.2% to $.75, compared to $.64 earned during the same period in 2004. Cash basis operating earnings for the first quarter of 2005 produced annualized returns on average tangible assets and average tangible shareholders' equity of 1.76% and 27.00%, respectively, compared to prior year returns of 1.62% and 23.93%, respectively.
          "I am pleased with the overall results for the first quarter," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John A. Allison. "BB&T's earnings improved significantly compared to last year and are ahead of our 2005 profit plan. The primary drivers of our performance were continued excellent credit quality, disciplined expense control and reasonably strong loan growth. We saw improvement in all key asset quality ratios during the quarter, including our nonperforming asset and net charge-off ratios, which are at their lowest levels in four years. We are experiencing significant seasonality in our noninterest income, particularly insurance commissions and service charges on deposits, and personnel expense compared to the fourth quarter last year. We believe these items will improve in the second quarter, and we are well positioned to meet our financial objectives for 2005."
BB&T Recognized Nationally for Service and Performance
          For the fifth time in seven years, the U.S. Small Business Administration has named BB&T the top ranked "small business-friendly" financial holding company in the country. The annual rankings recognize the financial institutions from which small businesses have been most successful in obtaining loans. This designation underscores the effectiveness of BB&T's credit culture and local decision-making process, which enable BB&T to meet the credit needs of small companies.
          During the first quarter, Mergent, Inc., a provider of global financial information, named BB&T to its elite "2005 Dividend Achiever Index" in recognition of BB&T's exceptional dividend paying history, the longest among banks, and excellent record of annual dividend increases. This prestigious designation was awarded to only 2% of the approximately 15,000 publicly traded firms reviewed by Mergent.
          On April 7, Moody's Investors Service announced that it had upgraded key ratings of BB&T Corporation and its subsidiary banks. Moody's cited BB&T's "good regional banking franchise, which is based on high quality customer service and successful cross sales" as well as BB&T's "very strong core profitability and sound credit culture" as the primary drivers of its decision.
Asset Quality Strongest in Four Years
          BB&T's already excellent asset quality continued to improve during the first quarter of 2005. Nonperforming assets, as a percentage of total assets, decreased to .33% at March 31 compared to .36% at Dec. 31, 2004 and .47% at March 31, 2004. Annualized net charge-offs were .28% of average loans and leases for the first quarter of 2005, down from .38% in the fourth quarter last year and .36% in the first quarter of 2004. Excluding losses incurred by BB&T's specialized lending subsidiaries, annualized net charge-offs for the current quarter were ..17% of average loans and leases compared to .25% in the first quarter of 2004.
Noninterest Expenses Decline  Reflecting Disciplined Expense Management
          BB&T's noninterest expenses totaled $730.7 million for the first quarter of 2005, a decrease of $3.7 million compared to the first quarter of 2004. Excluding merger-related items and growth resulting from purchase acquisitions, noninterest expenses declined 5.3% compared to the first quarter of 2004. The cash basis operating efficiency ratio of 50.6% for the first quarter of 2005 was significantly improved compared to the 52.8% achieved in the first quarter of 2004.
Average Loans Grow 8.5%
          Average loans and leases totaled $68.6 billion for the first quarter of 2005, an increase of 8.5% compared to the first quarter of 2004. Excluding the impact of growth resulting from acquisitions, a $1.0 billion mortgage loan securitization completed during the third quarter of 2004, and fluctuations in average loans held for sale, average loan growth was 7.6% compared to the first quarter of 2004. This growth was led by average mortgage loans, which increased 9.5%, average consumer loans, which increased 7.6% and average commercial loans, which grew 6.8%, compared to the first quarter last year.
Noninterest Income Reflects 8.7% Increase
          Total noninterest income was $516.6 million for the first quarter of 2005, an increase of 8.7% compared with the same period in 2004. Higher revenues from mortgage banking and BB&T's insurance operations, as well as an increase in other nondeposit fees and commissions, were the primary components of this growth.
          Revenues from mortgage banking operations totaled $30.2 million for the first quarter of 2005, an increase of $25.8 million compared to the first quarter last year. The increase was the result of higher revenues from the sale of residential mortgage loans, lower amortization expense related to mortgage servicing rights and a positive fluctuation in the valuation for mortgage servicing rights compared to the prior year's first quarter. Current quarter revenues include a net recapture of the valuation for mortgage servicing rights, including hedging activities, of $10.9 million compared to a $4.2 million net provision in the first quarter of 2004.
          BB&T's insurance operations continued to experience growth and are the largest provider of noninterest income. Insurance commissions increased 23.1% to $152.3 million in the current quarter compared with $123.7 million earned during the first quarter of 2004, primarily as a result of acquisitions. However, insurance commissions decreased $15.0 million, or 9.0% compared with the fourth quarter of 2004, reflecting the significant seasonality of BB&T's insurance operations.
          Other nondeposit fees and commissions totaled $80.4 million for the first quarter of 2005, an increase of $8.7 million, or 12.2%, compared to the first quarter of 2004. This increase was generated primarily by growth in bankcard fees and debit card related services.
          Service charges on deposit accounts totaled $120.8 million for the first quarter of 2005, a slight decrease compared to the $122.8 million in the same quarter last year. In addition, service charges on deposit accounts reflect a decrease of $12.8 million, or 9.6%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2004, which includes a seasonal decrease. These decreases were primarily attributable to lower fees on transaction based services, personal overdraft items, and commercial accounts due to higher earnings credits.
BB&T Expands Asset Management Business  Partners with Sterling Capital Management
          On Feb. 16, BB&T Corporation announced plans to acquire a 70% ownership interest in Sterling Capital Management LLC ("Sterling") of Charlotte, N.C.

This transaction, which was completed on April 1, greatly complements BB&T's existing asset management products and services, which are provided through BB&T Asset Management.
          At March 31, BB&T had $102 billion in assets and operated more than 1,400banking offices in the Carolinas, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Georgia, Maryland, Tennessee, Florida, Alabama, Indiana and Washington, D.C.

This press release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). BB&T's management uses these "non-GAAP" measures in their analysis of the Corporation's performance. Non-GAAP measures typically adjust GAAP performance measures to exclude the effects of charges, expenses and gains related to the consummation of mergers and acquisitions, and costs related to the integration of merged entities, as well as the amortization of intangibles and purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments in the case of "cash basis" performance measures. These non-GAAP measures may also exclude other significant gains, losses or expenses that are unusual in nature and not expected to recur. Since these items and their impact on BB&T's performance are difficult to predict, management believes presentations of financial measures excluding the impact of these items provide useful supplemental information that is important for a proper understanding of the operating results of BB&T's core businesses. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.
          
This press release contains certain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
