FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BB&T announces 2 quarter net income of $386.8 million; Reports operating earnings per share of $.75
nd
          WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.  BB&T Corporation (NYSE: BBT) reported today second quarter net income totaling $386.8 million, or $.70 per diluted share. Net income decreased 3.3% compared with $400.1 million earned in the second quarter of 2004 because of a one-time, non-cash adjustment related to property and equipment leases, which totaled $26.6 million after-tax, or $.05 per diluted share. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter decreased 2.8% compared to $.72 earned during the second quarter last year.
          Operating earnings for the second quarter of 2005 totaled $413.2 million, or $.75 per diluted share, excluding the impact of net after-tax merger-related credits and the adjustment for leases. Excluding the effects of merger-related and nonrecurring items from both 2005 and 2004, operating earnings for the second quarter of 2005 increased 3.2% compared with the second quarter last year, while diluted operating earnings per share increased 4.2% compared to the second quarter last year. Compared to the first quarter of 2005, operating earnings per share reflect an increase of 22.6% on an annualized basis.
          BB&T's second quarter operating results produced annualized returns on average assets and average shareholders' equity of 1.60% and 15.00%, respectively, compared to prior year returns of 1.66% and 15.18%, respectively.
          Cash basis operating results exclude the unamortized balances of intangibles from assets and shareholders' equity and exclude the amortization of intangibles, the net amortization of purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments, merger-related items and nonrecurring items from earnings. Cash basis operating earnings totaled $436.0 million for the second quarter of 2005, an increase of 3.2% compared to the second quarter of 2004. Cash basis operating diluted earnings per share were $.79 for the second quarter, an increase of 3.9% compared to $.76 earned during the same period in 2004. Cash basis operating earnings for the second quarter of 2005 produced annualized returns on average tangible assets and average tangible shareholders' equity of 1.77% and 27.82%, respectively, compared to prior year returns of 1.83% and 28.41%, respectively.
          "I am pleased to report solid operating results for the second quarter of 2005," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John A. Allison. "We are gaining momentum, particularly in lending, where we experienced one of our strongest quarters in recent years in terms of growth and quality. This growth was reflected in all our major loan categories. Also, our key asset quality ratios continued to improve this quarter, reaching their best levels in years. While it is unfortunate that we needed to record a one-time adjustment related to leases this quarter, it does not detract from the performance of our core operations, where most of the trends are very positive. We are fully on track to accomplish our financial objectives for 2005."
          For the first six months of 2005, BB&T's net income was $782.2 million, an increase of 7.4% compared to $728.6 million earned in the first six months of 2004. Diluted earnings per share for the first half of 2005 totaled $1.42, an increase of 7.6% compared to the same period in 2004. Excluding merger-related charges or credits and nonrecurring items, operating earnings totaled $806.9 million, and operating diluted earnings per share was $1.46, each reflecting an increase of 9.8% compared to the first six months of 2004.
Loan Growth Accelerates to 10.6% in Second Quarter
          Average loans and leases totaled $70.4 billion for the second quarter of 2005, an annualized increase of 10.6% compared to the first quarter of 2005. This growth was led by average mortgage loans, which increased 18.5%, average commercial loans, which increased 10.2%, and average consumer loans, which grew 6.7%, compared to the first quarter of 2005.
Asset Quality is Excellent  Improves Further in 2 Quarter
nd
          BB&T's asset quality continued to improve during the second quarter of 2005. Nonperforming assets, as a percentage of total assets, decreased to .29% at June 30 compared to .33% at March 31 and .42% at June 30, 2004. Annualized net charge-offs were .25% of average loans and leases for the second quarter of 2005, down from .28% in the first quarter of 2005 and .34% in the second quarter last year. These are the lowest levels of nonperforming assets and quarterly net charge-offs in four years. Excluding losses incurred by BB&T's specialized lending subsidiaries, annualized net charge-offs for the current quarter were .16% of average loans and leases compared to .17% in the first quarter of 2005 and .24% in the second quarter of 2004.
BB&T's Fee-Based Businesses Produce Healthy Growth
          BB&T's noninterest income generating businesses produced healthy growth rates during the second quarter with the exception of mortgage banking operations. Total noninterest income was $584.9 million for the quarter, an increase of 3.9% compared with the same period in 2004. Excluding mortgage banking operations, noninterest income increased 13.1% compared with the second quarter of 2004. In addition, noninterest income increased $68.3 million, or 53.0% on an annualized basis, compared to the first quarter of 2005, reflecting the significant seasonality in our first quarter noninterest income. These increases were led by higher revenues from investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions, revenues from insurance operations, trust revenues, service charges on deposit accounts and other nondeposit fees and commissions.
          Investment banking and brokerage operations had a very strong quarter, as fees increased 27.4% to $81.0 million in the second quarter of 2005 compared to $63.6 million earned in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily driven by higher revenues from investment banking services and improving trends in fixed income sales and trading.
          BB&T's insurance operations continued to experience growth and are the largest provider of noninterest income. Insurance commissions increased 10.3% to $181.6 million in the current quarter compared with $164.7 million earned during the second quarter of 2004. In addition, insurance commissions increased $29.3 million, or 77.2% on an annualized basis, compared to the first quarter of 2005, reflecting the seasonality of BB&T's insurance operations.
          Trust revenues increased 16.5% to $36.7 million in the second quarter of 2005 compared with $31.5 million earned in the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily attributable to the previously announced merger with Charlotte, N.C.  based Sterling Capital Management LLC, which occurred on April 1.
          Service charges on deposit accounts totaled $139.2 million for the second quarter of 2005, an increase of 5.9% compared to $131.4 million earned in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily attributable to higher revenues from overdraft items and a decrease in fee waivers, which were partially offset by a decline in commercial account revenues due to higher earnings credits.
          Other nondeposit fees and commissions totaled $91.6 million for the second quarter of 2005, an increase of $12.1 million, or 15.2%, compared to the second quarter of 2004. This increase was generated primarily by growth in bankcard fees and debit card related services.
          Revenues from mortgage banking operations totaled $12.4 million for the second quarter of 2005, a decrease of $44.3 million compared to the second quarter last year. The decrease was primarily the result of fluctuations in the valuation allowance for mortgage servicing rights. Current quarter revenues include a net provision for the valuation of mortgage servicing rights, including hedging activities, of $9.1 million compared to a $30.4 million net recapture of the valuation allowance in the second quarter of 2004. In addition, revenues from residential mortgage production activities declined $8.7 million compared to the same quarter last year because a larger percentage of loan originations were retained this year.
Noninterest Expense
          BB&T's noninterest expenses totaled $831.3 million for the second quarter of 2005, an increase of $91.0 million compared to the second quarter of 2004. This increase includes expenses related to a $43.0 million one-time adjustment to account for escalating lease payments and the amortization of leasehold improvements in response to guidance issued earlier this year.
          Excluding merger-related items, the lease adjustment and growth resulting from purchase acquisitions, noninterest expenses increased 3.5% compared to the second quarter of 2004. The cash basis operating efficiency ratio of 50.3% for the second quarter of 2005 improved slightly compared to the first quarter of 2005.
BB&T Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend
          On June 28, BB&T's board of directors approved an 8.6% increase in the quarterly cash dividend paid to shareholders. The increase, to $.38 per share, marks the 34 consecutive year that BB&T has raised its cash dividend to shareholders. BB&T has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1903. The dividend will be paid on August 1 to shareholders of record on July 15.
th
          At June 30, BB&T had $105.8 billion in assets and operated more than 1,400 banking offices in the Carolinas, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Georgia, Maryland, Tennessee, Florida, Alabama, Indiana and Washington, D.C. BB&T's common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol BBT. The closing price of BB&T's common stock on July 12 was $41.59 per share.

This press release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). BB&T's management uses these "non-GAAP" measures in their analysis of the Corporation's performance. Non-GAAP measures typically adjust GAAP performance measures to exclude the effects of charges, expenses and gains related to the consummation of mergers and acquisitions, and costs related to the integration of merged entities, as well as the amortization of intangibles and purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments in the case of "cash basis" performance measures. These non-GAAP measures may also exclude other significant gains, losses or expenses that are unusual in nature and not expected to recur. Since these items and their impact on BB&T's performance are difficult to predict, management believes presentations of financial measures excluding the impact of these items provide useful supplemental information that is important for a proper understanding of the operating results of BB&T's core businesses. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.
