FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

          WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.  BB&T Corporation (NYSE: BBT) reported today third quarter net income totaling $442.0 million, or $.80 per diluted share. Net income increased 7.1% compared with $412.9 million earned in the third quarter of 2004. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter increased 8.1% compared to $.74 earned during the third quarter last year.
          Operating earnings for the third quarter of 2005 totaled $440.9 million, or $.80 per diluted share, excluding the impact of net after-tax merger-related credits. Excluding the effects of merger-related items from both 2005 and 2004, operating earnings for the third quarter of 2005 increased 7.3% compared with the third quarter last year, while diluted operating earnings per share increased 8.1% compared to the same quarter last year.
          BB&T's third quarter net income produced annualized returns on average assets and average shareholders' equity of 1.65% and 15.69%, respectively, compared to prior year returns of 1.69% and 15.42%, respectively.
          Cash basis operating results exclude the unamortized balances of intangibles from assets and shareholders' equity and exclude the amortization of intangibles, the net amortization of purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments, merger-related items and nonrecurring items from earnings. Cash basis operating earnings totaled $462.4 million for the third quarter of 2005, an increase of 7.5% compared to the third quarter of 2004. Cash basis operating diluted earnings per share were $.84 for the third quarter of 2005, an increase of 9.1% compared to $.77 earned during the same period in 2004. Cash basis operating earnings for the third quarter of 2005 produced annualized returns on average tangible assets and average tangible shareholders' equity of 1.81% and 28.56%, respectively, compared to prior year returns of 1.85% and 28.50%, respectively.
          "I am very pleased to report strong results for the third quarter of 2005," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John A. Allison. "Our results were driven by very healthy growth in our loan portfolios, which accelerated across all loan categories during the quarter, a solid performance from our noninterest income generating businesses and continued excellent asset quality. We continue to build earnings momentum through the improved execution of our sales efforts and are in position to meet substantially all our strategic and financial objectives for 2005."
          For the first nine months of 2005, BB&T's net income was $1.22 billion, an increase of 7.2% compared to $1.14 billion earned in the first nine months of 2004. Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of 2005 totaled $2.22, an increase of 8.3% compared to the same period in 2004. Excluding merger-related charges or credits and nonrecurring items, operating earnings totaled $1.25 billion, and operating diluted earnings per share were $2.26, reflecting increases of 8.9% and 9.7%, respectively, compared to the first nine months of 2004.
Loan Growth Accelerates to 13.1% in Third Quarter
          Average loans and leases totaled $72.7 billion for the third quarter of 2005, reflecting an increase of $2.3 billion, or 13.1% on an annualized basis, compared to the second quarter of 2005. This growth was led by average mortgage loans, which increased at an annualized rate of 24.8% compared to the second quarter of 2005. Average consumer loans grew 10.4% on an annualized basis compared to the second quarter of 2005, with average direct retail loans and average revolving credit accounts increasing at annualized rates of 8.1% and 10.7%, respectively. Sales finance loans improved substantially compared to recent trends, increasing an annualized 15.6% on average compared to the second quarter of 2005. BB&T also benefited from continued positive growth trends in commercial loans, which increased an annualized 10.5% on average compared to the second quarter of 2005.
BB&T's Fee-Based Businesses Enjoy Another Solid Quarter
          BB&T's noninterest income generating businesses produced solid growth rates during the third quarter of 2005 compared to 2004. Total noninterest income was $605.1 million for the current quarter, an increase of 13.6% compared with the same period in 2004. The increase includes higher revenues from insurance operations, mortgage banking operations, service charges on deposit accounts, trust services, investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions and other nondeposit fees and commissions.
          BB&T's insurance operations continue to expand through acquisitions and internal growth and are the largest provider of noninterest income. Insurance commissions increased 12.0% to $182.9 million in the current quarter compared with $163.4 million earned during the third quarter of 2004. The increase was the result of growth in commissions from the sale of property and casualty coverage and improved sales of employee benefit-related insurance products.
          Revenues from mortgage banking operations totaled $35.8 million for the third quarter of 2005, an increase of $13.8 million compared to the third quarter last year. The increase was primarily the result of fluctuations in the valuation allowance for mortgage servicing rights. Current quarter revenues include a net recapture of the valuation of mortgage servicing rights, including hedging activities, of $11.0 million compared to a $5.0 million net impairment for the valuation allowance in the same quarter of 2004. For the nine months, earnings include a net recapture of $12.8 million compared to a recapture of $21.1 million recorded during the first nine months of 2004.
          Service charges on deposit accounts totaled $141.1 million for the third quarter of 2005, an increase of 4.1% compared to $135.5 million earned in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in revenues from overdraft items and a decrease in fee waivers, which were partially offset by a decline in commercial account revenues due to higher earnings credits and a decline in monthly account service fees on personal checking products.
          Trust revenues increased 26.6% to $36.6 million in the third quarter of 2005 compared with $28.9 million earned in the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily attributable to the previously announced merger with Charlotte, N.C.  based Sterling Capital Management LLC, which occurred on April 1, and growth in mutual fund administration fees.
          BB&T's investment banking and brokerage operations enjoyed a strong quarter, as fees increased 17.1% to $70.0 million in the third quarter of 2005 compared to $59.8 million earned in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily driven by growth in revenues from investment banking services and commissions on retail accounts at Scott & Stringfellow.
          Other nondeposit fees and commissions totaled $97.2 million for the third quarter of 2005, an increase of $14.4 million, or 17.4%, compared to the third quarter of 2004. This increase was generated primarily by growth in bankcard fees and debit card related services.
Asset Quality Remains Excellent  Nonperforming Assets Improve
          BB&T's asset quality remained excellent during the third quarter of 2005. Nonperforming assets, as a percentage of total assets, decreased to .28% at Sept. 30 compared to .29% at June 30 and .40% at Sept. 30, 2004. Annualized net charge-offs were ..30% of average loans and leases for the third quarter of 2005, up from .25% in the second quarter of 2005, but down from .34% in the third quarter last year. Excluding losses incurred by BB&T's specialized lending subsidiaries, annualized net charge-offs for the current quarter were .19% of average loans and leases compared to .16% in the second quarter of 2005 and .19% in the third quarter of 2004.
Noninterest Expense
          BB&T's noninterest expenses totaled $786.5 million for the third quarter of 2005. Excluding merger-related items and growth resulting from purchase acquisitions, noninterest expenses increased 7.5% compared to the third quarter of 2004. However, excluding purchase acquisitions, noninterest expenses decreased 1.0% on an annualized basis compared to the second quarter of this year. The cash basis operating efficiency ratio for the third quarter of 2005 improved to 49.7% compared to 50.3% in the second quarter of 2005.
BB&T Recognized for Service Excellence in Business Banking
          During the third quarter,BB&T received six "Excellence in Business Banking" awards from Greenwich Associates, a strategic consulting and research firm based in Connecticut.

This press release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"). BB&T's management uses these "non-GAAP" measures in their analysis of the Corporation's performance. Non-GAAP measures typically adjust GAAP performance measures to exclude the effects of charges, expenses and gains related to the consummation of mergers and acquisitions, and costs related to the integration of merged entities, as well as the amortization of intangibles and purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments in the case of "cash basis" performance measures. These non-GAAP measures may also exclude other significant gains, losses or expenses that are unusual in nature and not expected to recur. Since these items and their impact on BB&T's performance are difficult to predict, management believes presentations of financial measures excluding the impact of these items provide useful supplemental information that is important for a proper understanding of the operating results of BB&T's core businesses. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.
