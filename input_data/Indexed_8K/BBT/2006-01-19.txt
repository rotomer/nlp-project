FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BB&T reports record 2005 net income of $1.65 billion; Operating earnings per share total $3.04, an increase of 8.2%
          WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.  BB&T Corporation (NYSE: BBT) reported today earnings for the fourth quarter and the full year 2005. For the fourth quarter, net income totaled $429.6 million, or $.78 per diluted share, compared with $416.9 million, or $.75 per diluted share, earned during the fourth quarter of 2004. These results reflect increases of 3.0% and 4.0%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter last year.
          For the full year 2005, BB&T's net income was $1.65 billion, an increase of 6.1% compared to $1.56 billion earned in 2004. Diluted earnings per share for 2005 totaled $3.00, an increase of 7.1% compared to $2.80 in 2004. Excluding $19.8 million in net after-tax merger-related and nonrecurring charges from 2005 and $3.5 million in net after-tax merger-related charges from 2004, operating earnings for 2005 totaled $1.67 billion, an increase of 7.2% compared to operating earnings of $1.56 billion in 2004. Diluted operating earnings per share totaled $3.04 in 2005, an increase of 8.2% compared to $2.81 earned in 2004.
          Cash basis operating results exclude the unamortized balances of intangibles from assets and shareholders' equity and exclude the amortization of intangibles, the net amortization of purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments, merger-related items and nonrecurring items from earnings. Cash basis operating earnings totaled $448.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, an increase of 2.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2004. Cash basis operating diluted earnings per share were $.82 for the fourth quarter of 2005, an increase of 3.8% compared to $.79 earned during the same period in 2004. Cash basis operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2005 produced annualized returns on average tangible assets and average tangible shareholders' equity of 1.73% and 27.88%, respectively, compared to prior year returns of 1.86% and 27.77%, respectively.
          "Although bottom-line results for the fourth quarter of 2005 were less than we had hoped, I am pleased that we produced solid earnings for the full year and accomplished many of our strategic objectives," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John A. Allison. "Our results for 2005 mark the 24 consecutive year that BB&T has achieved record operating earnings. In addition, we also saw year over year improvement in many of the key areas that contribute to our profitability. We experienced healthy revenue growth in our noninterest income generating businesses, improved our already excellent asset quality, and enjoyed one of our strongest years in terms of combined loan and deposit growth. Our fourth quarter results were negatively affected by a difficult interest rate environment, which compressed our margins, and unusually high growth in noninterest expenses, which largely resulted from the hiring of revenue producers, revenue-based incentives, and a significant new commitment to advertising."
th
BB&T Enjoys Strong Loan Growth  Up 10.2%
          Average loans and leases totaled $74.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2005, reflecting an increase of $6.9 billion, or 10.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2004. This growth was led by average mortgage loans, which increased 18.4%, average commercial loans and leases, which increased 9.2% and average consumer loans, which increased 7.1% compared to the fourth quarter last year.
Asset Quality Remains Excellent  Nonperforming Assets Improve
          BB&T's asset quality remained excellent during the fourth quarter of 2005. Nonperforming assets, as a percentage of total assets, decreased to .27% at Dec. 31, 2005 compared to .28% at Sept. 30, 2005 and .36% at Dec. 31, 2004. Annualized net charge-offs were .37% of average loans and leases for the fourth quarter of 2005, a slight decrease from .38% in the fourth quarter of 2004, but up from .30% in the third quarter of 2005 due largely to seasonal factors. Net charge-offs for the full year 2005 were .30% of average loans and leases, a decrease of 6 basis points from .36% for 2004. Excluding losses incurred by BB&T's specialized lending subsidiaries, annualized net charge-offs for the current quarter were .25% of average loans and leases compared to .27% in the same quarter last year.
BB&T's Fee Based Businesses Produce Solid Quarterly and Annual Growth Rates
          BB&T's noninterest income generating businesses produced solid growth rates during the fourth quarter and full year of 2005 compared to 2004. Total noninterest income was $619.0 million for the current quarter, an increase of 12.9% compared with the same period in 2004. For the full year of 2005, noninterest income increased 9.7% to $2.33 billion compared to $2.12 billion for 2004. These increases include higher revenues from insurance operations, trust services, investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions, services charges on deposit accounts and other nondeposit fees and commissions.
          BB&T's insurance operations continue to expand through acquisitions and internal growth and are the largest provider of noninterest income. Insurance commissions increased 18.0% to $197.4 million in the current quarter compared with $167.3 million earned during the fourth quarter last year. For the full year 2005, insurance commissions totaled $714.2 million, an increase of 15.4% compared to 2004. These increases were the result of growth in commissions from the sale of property and casualty coverage and improved sales of employee benefit-related insurance products.
          Trust revenues increased 26.9% to $36.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared with $29.1 million earned in the fourth quarter of 2004. Trust revenues for the full year 2005 totaled $140.6 million, an increase of 17.7% compared to 2004. These increases were primarily attributable to the previously announced merger with Charlotte, N.C.  based Sterling Capital Management LLC, which occurred on April 1, 2005, and growth in mutual fund administration fees.
          BB&T's investment banking and brokerage operations enjoyed a strong quarter, as fees increased 7.6% to $69.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to $64.7 million earned in the same quarter last year. For the full year 2005, investment banking and brokerage commissions totaled $289.6 million, an increase of 9.4% compared to 2004. These increases were primarily driven by growth in revenues from investment banking services and commissions on retail accounts at Scott & Stringfellow.
          Service charges on deposit accounts totaled $141.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, an increase of 6.0% compared to $133.6 million earned in the same quarter last year. For the full year 2005, service charges on deposit accounts totaled $542.7 million, an increase of 3.7% compared to 2004. These increases were primarily attributable to growth in revenues from overdraft items and a decrease in fee waivers, which were partially offset by a decline in commercial account revenues due to higher earnings credits and a decline in monthly account service fees on personal checking products.
          Other nondeposit fees and commissions totaled $100.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, an increase of 18.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2004. For the full year 2005, other nondeposit fees and commissions increased 15.9% to $369.3 million. These increases were generated primarily by growth in bankcard fees and debit card related services.
          Revenues from mortgage banking operations totaled $25.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, a slight decrease compared to the $26.9 million earned in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year 2005, mortgage banking revenues were $103.8 million, a decrease of 5.7% compared to 2004. These decreases were primarily the result of fluctuations in the valuation allowance for mortgage servicing rights. Current quarter revenues include a net loss of $3.3 million, composed of a recapture of the valuation allowance for mortgage-servicing rights, which was more than offset by hedging activities, compared to a $4.0 million net recapture in the same quarter of 2004. For the full year 2005, earnings include a net recapture of $9.5 million compared to a net recapture of $25.2 million recorded in 2004.
BB&T Receives Strong Debt Ratings
          On Dec. 19, 2005, Dominion Bond Rating Service ("DBRS") announced that it had initiated debt ratings for BB&T, assigning a AA rating to the senior and subordinated debt of BB&T Corporation and its principal banking subsidiary, Branch Banking & Trust Company. In assigning its ratings, DBRS noted that "BB&T benefits from a powerful banking and financial services franchise in a high-growth, southeastern U.S. footprint." DBRS also cited that the ratings reflect BB&T's "strong and stable earnings and robust profitability generated by the franchise, along with BB&T's ample liquidity and capital."
BB&T Expands in Key Markets
          On Dec. 15, 2005, BB&T announced plans to acquire Atlanta, Ga.-based Main Street Banks, Inc. in a $622.7 million stock swap.

After the merger, BB&T will advance from sixth to fifth in deposit market share in both metropolitan Atlanta and Georgia. With $2.5 billion in assets, Main Street Banks is the largest community bank in metro Atlanta. It operates 24 full-service banking centers in the Atlanta and Athens, Ga., metro areas. The merger, which is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2006.
          On Jan. 12, BB&T announced plans to acquire privately held First Citizens Bancorp of Cleveland, Tenn. for $142.6 million in cash and stock. After the merger, BB&T will advance from ninth to seventh in deposit market share in Tennessee and from eighth to first in deposit market share in the Cleveland metropolitan statistical area. With $686 million in assets, First Citizens operates 16 full-service banking centers in Tennessee, two in North Carolina and one in Georgia. The merger, which is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2006.

This press release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"). BB&T's management uses these "non-GAAP" measures in their analysis of the Corporation's performance. Non-GAAP measures typically adjust GAAP performance measures to exclude the effects of charges, expenses and gains related to the consummation of mergers and acquisitions, and costs related to the integration of merged entities, as well as the amortization of intangibles and purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments in the case of "cash basis" performance measures. These non-GAAP measures may also exclude other significant gains, losses or expenses that are unusual in nature and not expected to recur. Since these items and their impact on BB&T's performance are difficult to predict, management believes presentations of financial measures excluding the impact of these items provide useful supplemental information that is important for a proper understanding of the operating results of BB&T's core businesses. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.
