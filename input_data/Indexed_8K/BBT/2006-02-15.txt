ITEM 8.01   Other Events
           
BB&T Corporation held an analyst conference on February 14, 2006, which was simultaneously web cast on BB&T's website at . A recording of that web cast is available, and will be available until 5:00 p.m. Friday, March 3, 2006, on BB&T's website at . Standard procedures dictate that the newswire service that BB&T uses for public dissemination of information, PRNewswire, issue a press release on its newswire in connection with, and prior to, any analyst conference web cast made available on BB&T's website, notifying the public of the date and time of the web cast and the means for gaining access to the web cast. BB&T learned today that such notice was not generally released to the public prior to the analyst conference and web cast held on February 14, 2006. BB&T, therefore, is furnishing as exhibits to this Form 8-K the presentation materials that were made available during the analyst conference held on February 14, 2006.
