THIS AGREEMENT
          BB&T desires to carry out the purposes of the Plan by affording the Participant an opportunity to purchase shares of BB&T's common stock, $5.00 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), as hereinafter provided.
          In consideration of the foregoing, of the mutual promises set forth below and of other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:
           
1.      . The rights and duties of BB&T and the Participant under this Agreement shall in all respects be subject to and governed by the provisions of the Plan, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. In the event of any conflict between the provisions in the Agreement and those of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall govern. Unless otherwise provided herein, capitalized terms in this Agreement shall have the same definitions as set forth in the Plan.
Incorporation of Plan
           
2.      . Pursuant to the Plan, effective as of ___________ ___, 20__ (the "Grant Date"), BB&T grants to the Participant, subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and the terms and conditions herein, the right and option (the "Option") to purchase from BB&T all or any part of an aggregate of Options_ shares (the "Shares") of Common Stock at a purchase price (the "Option Price") of $_______ per share, such Option Price being the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the Grant Date. This Option is designated as a Nonqualified Option and, as such, is not intended to be an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Such Option will be vested and exercisable as hereinafter provided.
Grant of Option
           3.      Terms and Conditions. The Option is subject to the following terms and conditions:
           
4.      . Except as provided in Sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 (and unless otherwise determined by the Administrator), in the event that the employment of the Participant with BB&T or an Affiliate terminates for any reason other than involuntary termination without Just Cause, Retirement, death or Disability, the Participant may exercise the Option only with respect to those Shares of Common Stock as to which the Option has become vested and exercisable pursuant to Section 3(b) as of the date of his termination of employment (the "Termination Date"). The Participant may exercise the Option with respect to such Shares no more than thirty (30) days after the date of the Participant's Termination Date (but in any event prior to the Expiration Date), and the Option shall terminate at the end of such 30-day period.
Termination of Employment
           
5.      . In the event that the Participant's employment with BB&T or its Affiliates is involuntarily terminated by BB&T without Just Cause, the Option shall become fully vested and fully exercisable as of his Termination Date without regard to the installment exercise limitations set forth in Section 3(b). For purposes of this Agreement, the involuntary termination of the Participant by BB&T shall be without Just Cause unless the termination is on account of the Participant's (a) dishonesty, theft or embezzlement; (b) refusal or failure to perform his assigned duties for BB&T or its Affiliates in a satisfactory manner; or (c) engaging in any conduct that could be materially damaging to BB&T or its Affiliates without a reasonable good faith belief that such conduct was in the best interest of BB&T or any of its Affiliates. The determination of Just Cause shall be made by the Administrator or its designee and its determination shall be final and conclusive. The Participant may exercise the Option following an involuntary termination without Just Cause until the Expiration Date.
Involuntary Termination Without Just Cause
           
6.      . In the event that the Participant remains in the continuous employ of BB&T or its Affiliates from the Grant Date until the Participant's Retirement (as determined in accordance with the Plan), the Option shall become fully vested and fully exercisable as of the date of his Retirement without regard to the installment exercise limitations set forth in Section 3(b). The Participant may exercise the Option following his Retirement until the Expiration Date.
Exercise After Retirement
           
7.      . In the event that the Participant remains in the continuous employ of BB&T or its Affiliates from the Grant Date until his death, the Option shall become fully vested and fully exercisable as of the date of death without regard to the installment exercise limitations set forth in Section 3(b). The Option shall be exercisable by such person or persons who are designated as the Participant's beneficiary in accordance with the terms of the Plan and this Agreement, or, if no such valid beneficiary designation exists, then by the Participant's estate or by such person or persons as shall have acquired the right to exercise the Option by will or the laws of descent and distribution. The person or persons entitled to exercise the Option following the Participant's death may exercise the Option until the Expiration Date.
Exercise in the Event of Death
           
8.      . In the event that the Participant remains in the continuous employ of BB&T or its Affiliates from the Grant Date until the date of his Disability (as determined in accordance with the Plan), the Option shall become fully vested and fully exercisable as of the date of his termination of employment on account of his Disability without regard to the installment exercise limitations set forth in Section 3(b). The Participant may exercise the Option following such termination of employment until the Expiration Date.
Exercise in the Event of Disability
           
9.      . A fractional share shall not be issuable hereunder, and when any provision hereof may entitle the Participant to a fractional share, such fraction shall (unless the Administrator determines otherwise) be disregarded.
Fractional Share
           
10.      .
Change of Corporate Control
           
11.      . Neither the Plan, the grant of the Option nor any other action related to the Plan shall confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the employment or service of BB&T or an Affiliate or affect in any way with the right of BB&T to terminate an individual's employment or service at any time. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or this Agreement, all rights of the Participant under the Plan with respect to the Option shall terminate upon termination of the employment of the Participant to BB&T. The grant of the Option does not create any obligation on the part of BB&T or an Affiliate to grant any further awards. So long as the Participant shall continue to be an Employee of BB&T or an Affiliate, the Option shall not be affected by any change in the duties or position of the Participant.
No Right to Continued Employment; Forfeiture of Award
           
12.      . This Agreement supersedes any statements, representations or agreements of BB&T with respect to the grant of the Option or any related rights, and the Participant hereby waives any rights or claims related to any such statements, representations or agreements. This Agreement does not supersede or amend any existing confidentiality agreement, nonsolicitation agreement, noncompetition agreement, employment agreement or any other similar agreement between the Participant and BB&T, including, but not limited to, any restrictive covenants contained in such agreements.
Superseding Agreement
           
13.      . Subject to the terms of the Plan, this Agreement may be modified or amended only by the written agreement of the parties hereto. The waiver by BB&T of a breach of any provision of the Agreement by the Participant shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator shall have unilateral authority to amend the Plan and this Agreement (without Participant consent) to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law or changes to applicable law (including but in no way limited to Code Section 409A and related regulations or other guidance and federal securities laws), and the Participant hereby consents to any such amendments to the Plan and this Agreement.

Severability
           
16.      . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or the Agreement, BB&T may reduce the amount of any benefit or payment otherwise payable to or on behalf of the Participant by the amount of any obligation of the Participant to BB&T or an Affiliate that is or becomes due and payable, and the Participant shall be deemed to have consented to such reduction.
Right of Offset
           
17.      . This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. The parties hereto agree to execute such further instruments and to take such further action as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement.
Counterparts; Further Instruments
           
18.      . Any and all notices under the Option shall be in writing, and sent by hand delivery or by certified or registered mail (return receipt requested and first-class postage prepaid), in the case of BB&T, to its Human Systems Division to the attention of the Human Systems Division Manager, and in the case of the Participant, to the last known address of the Participant as reflected in BB&T's records.
Notices
           
19.      . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of North Carolina, without regard to the principles of conflicts of law, and in accordance with applicable United States federal laws.
Governing Law
           
20.      . Subject to the limitations stated herein and in the Plan, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Participant and his executors, administrators and permitted transferees and beneficiaries and BB&T and its successors and assigns.

BB&T may impose such restrictions on the Option and Shares or any other benefits underlying the Option as it may deem advisable, including without limitation restrictions under the federal securities laws, federal tax laws, the requirements of any stock exchange or similar organization and any blue sky, state or foreign securities laws applicable to such securities. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan or this Agreement to the contrary, BB&T shall not be obligated to issue, deliver or transfer Shares of Common Stock under the Plan, make any other distribution of benefits under the Plan, or take any other action, unless such delivery, distribution or action is in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations (including but not limited to the requirements of the Securities Act). BB&T may cause a restrictive legend to be placed on any certificate for Shares issued pursuant to the Option in such form as may be prescribed from time to time by applicable laws and regulations or as may be advised by legal counsel.
Compliance with Laws; Restrictions on Option and Shares
           
22.      . The Administrator shall have authority to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Option in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events affecting BB&T or any Affiliate, or the financial statements of BB&T or any Affiliate, or of changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles, if the Administrator determines that such adjustments are appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan or necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations.
Adjustment of Awards upon the Occurrence of Certain Unusual or Nonrecurring Events
           
23.      .

8.      . This Agreement supersedes any statements, representations or agreements of BB&T with respect to the grant of the Award or any related rights, and the Participant hereby waives any rights or claims related to any such statements, representations or agreements. This Agreement does not supersede or amend any existing confidentiality agreement, nonsolicitation agreement, noncompetition agreement, employment agreement or any other similar agreement between the Participant and BB&T, including, but not limited to, any restrictive covenants contained in such agreements.

10.      . Subject to the terms of the Plan, this Agreement may be amended or terminated only by the written agreement of the parties hereto. The waiver by BB&T of a breach of any provision of the Agreement by the Participant shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator shall have unilateral authority to amend the Plan and this Agreement (without Participant consent) to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law or changes to applicable law (including but in no way limited to Code Section 409A and related regulations or other guidance and federal securities laws), and the Participant hereby consents to any such amendments to the Plan and this Agreement.

No certificate or certificates for Shares subject to the Award shall be issued at the time of grant of the Award. A certificate or certificates for Shares subject to the Award shall be issued in the name of the Participant (or his or her beneficiary) as soon as practicable after, and only to the extent that, the Award has vested and if such distribution is otherwise permitted under the terms of Section 5 herein.
Certificates for Shares; Rights as Shareholder
Neither dividends nor dividend equivalent rights shall be granted in connection with the Award, and the Award shall not be adjusted to reflect the distribution of any dividends on the Common Stock (except as may otherwise be provided under the Plan). No dividends on the Shares shall be payable prior to both (i) the vesting of the Award and (ii) the issuance and distribution of Shares to the Participant.

Any interpretation of the Agreement by the Administrator and any decision made by it with respect to the Agreement is final and binding on the parties hereto.
Administration
           
14.      . Any and all notices under this Agreement shall be in writing and sent by hand delivery or by certified or registered mail (return receipt requested and first-class postage prepaid), in the case of BB&T, to its Human Systems Division, to the attention of the Human Systems Division Manager, and in the case of the Participant, to the last known address of the Participant as reflected in BB&T's records.
Notices
           
15.      . The provisions of this Agreement are severable and if any one or more provisions may be determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.
Severability
           
16.      . BB&T may impose such restrictions on the Award and the Shares or other benefits underlying the Award as it may deem advisable, including without limitation restrictions under the federal securities laws, federal tax laws, the requirements of any stock exchange or similar organization and any blue sky, state or foreign securities laws applicable to such Award or Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan or the Agreement to the contrary, BB&T shall not be obligated to issue, deliver or transfer any Shares of Common Stock, make any other distribution of benefits under the Plan, or take any other action, unless such delivery, distribution or action is in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations (including but not limited to the requirements of the Securities Act). BB&T may cause a restrictive legend or legends to be placed on any certificate for Shares issued pursuant to the Award in such form as may be prescribed from time to time by applicable laws and regulations or as may be advised by legal counsel.
Compliance with Laws; Restrictions on Award and Shares
           
17.      . Subject to the limitations stated herein and in the Plan, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Participant and his executors, administrators and permitted transferees and beneficiaries and BB&T and its successors and assigns.
Successors and Assigns
           
18.      . This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. The parties hereto agree to execute such further instruments and to take such further action as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement.
Counterparts; Further Instruments
           
19.      . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or the Agreement, BB&T may reduce the amount of any benefit or payment otherwise payable to or on behalf of the Participant by the amount of any obligation of the Participant to BB&T or an Affiliate that is or becomes due and payable, and the Participant shall be deemed to have consented to such reduction.
Right of Offset
           
20.      . The Administrator shall have authority to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Award in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events affecting BB&T or any Affiliate, or the financial statements of BB&T or any Affiliate, or of changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles, if the Administrator determines that such adjustments are appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan or necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations.
Adjustment of Awards upon Occurrence of Certain Unusual or Nonrecurring Events
          , this Agreement has been executed in behalf of BB&T and by the Participant effective as of the day and year first above written.
