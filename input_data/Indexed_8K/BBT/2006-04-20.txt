FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BB&T's 1 quarter EPS totals $.79, up 11.3%
st
          WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.  BB&T Corporation (NYSE: BBT) reported today net income for the first quarter of 2006 totaling $431.5 million, or $.79 per diluted share, compared with $395.4 million, or $.71 per diluted share, earned during the first quarter of 2005. These results reflect increases of 9.1% and 11.3%, respectively, compared to the first quarter last year.
          BB&T's first quarter net income produced annualized returns on average assets and average shareholders' equity of 1.60% and 15.72%, respectively, compared to prior year returns of 1.60% and 14.70%, respectively.
          Operating earnings for the first quarter of 2006 totaled $427.7 million, or $.79 per diluted share, excluding an $18.3 million after-tax gain from the sale of duplicate facilities, $1.8 million in net after-tax merger-related credits and $16.4 million in after-tax equity-based compensation resulting from the adoption of SFAS 123(R) during the current quarter. Operating earnings for the first quarter of 2005 totaled $393.8 million, excluding $1.6 million in net after-tax merger-related credits. These results reflect increases of 8.6% and 11.3%, respectively, compared to the same period last year.
          Cash basis operating results exclude the unamortized balances of intangibles from assets and shareholders' equity and exclude the amortization of intangibles, the net amortization of purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments, merger-related items and nonrecurring items from earnings. Cash basis operating earnings totaled $446.6 million for the first quarter of 2006, an increase of 7.4% compared to the first quarter of 2005. Cash basis operating diluted earnings per share totaled $.82 for the first quarter of 2006, an increase of 9.3% compared to $.75 earned during the same period in 2005. Cash basis operating earnings for the first quarter of 2006 produced annualized returns on average tangible assets and average tangible shareholders' equity of 1.74% and 28.41%, respectively, compared to prior year returns of 1.76% and 27.00%, respectively.
          "I am very pleased to report strong results for the first quarter of 2006," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John A. Allison. "The double-digit increase in earnings per share was driven by 10.2% growth in revenues, including a 17.7% increase in noninterest income, continued excellent asset quality, as evidenced by the lowest level of nonperforming assets in over ten years, and very strong combined loan and deposit growth. While expenses also increased significantly compared to the first quarter last year, this growth is consistent with our plan and reflects important investments for the future. Given that our first quarter is usually negatively affected by a number of seasonal factors, I am encouraged that these positive results reflect a very good start to 2006."
BB&T's Fee Based Businesses Enjoy Strong Quarterly Growth
          BB&T's noninterest income generating businesses produced solid growth rates during the first quarter of 2006 compared to 2005. Total noninterest income was $608.2 million for the current quarter, an increase of 17.7% compared with the same period in 2005. This increase includes improved revenues from insurance operations, trust services, investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions, services charges on deposit accounts, other nondeposit fees and commissions and mortgage banking income.
          BB&T's insurance operations continue to expand through acquisitions and internal growth and are the largest provider of noninterest income. Insurance commissions increased 15.9% to $176.5 million in the current quarter compared with $152.3 million earned during the first quarter last year. This increase was the result of growth in commissions from the sale of property and casualty coverage and improved sales of employee benefits-related insurance products.
          Trust revenues increased 21.7% to $37.0 million in the first quarter of 2006 compared with $30.4 million earned in the first quarter of 2005. This increase was primarily attributable to the merger with Sterling Capital Management LLC, which occurred on April 1, 2005.
          BB&T's investment banking and brokerage operations enjoyed the strongest quarter in their history, as fees increased 18.0% to $81.3 million compared to $68.9 million earned in the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily driven by growth in revenues from investment banking services and commissions on retail accounts at Scott & Stringfellow.
          Service charges on deposit accounts totaled $131.2 million for the first quarter of 2006, an increase of 8.7% compared to $120.8 million earned in the same quarter last year. This increase was attributable to growth in revenues from overdraft items, which was partially offset by a decline in monthly account service fees due to growth in free checking accounts and free online services
.
          Other nondeposit fees and commissions totaled $101.6 million for the first quarter of 2006, an increase of 26.4% compared to the first quarter of 2005. This increase was generated primarily by growth in bankcard fees and debit card related services.
          Revenues from mortgage banking operations totaled $32.3 million for the first quarter of 2006, an increase of 7.0% compared to the $30.2 million earned in the first quarter last year. This increase was primarily the result of increased revenues from commercial mortgage banking operations, which increased $5.7 million compared to the first quarter of 2005.
Asset Quality Remains Excellent  Nonperforming Assets Improve
          BB&T's asset quality remains excellent and improved further during the first quarter of 2006. Nonperforming assets, as a percentage of total assets, were .27% at both March 31 and Dec. 31, 2005, compared to .33% at March 31, 2005. Annualized net charge-offs were .26% of average loans and leases for the first quarter of 2006, down from .28% in the first quarter of 2005. Excluding losses incurred by BB&T's specialized lending subsidiaries, annualized net charge-offs for the current quarter were .13% of average loans and leases compared to .17% in the same quarter last year.
Combined Loan and Deposit Growth Remains Strong
          Average loans and leases totaled $75.4 billion for the first quarter of 2006, reflecting an increase of $6.9 billion, or 10.0% compared to the first quarter of 2005. This increase was composed of growth in average commercial loans and leases, which increased $3.1 billion, or 9.3%, average mortgage loans, which increased $2.2 billion, or 17.5%, average consumer loans, which increased $1.0 billion, or 5.1% and growth in average loans originated by BB&T's specialized lending subsidiaries, which increased $530.9 million, or 22.9% compared to the first quarter last year.
          Average deposits totaled $74.2 billion for the first quarter of 2006, an increase of 10.2% compared to $67.3 billion for the first quarter of 2005. Average retail deposit growth was led by client certificates of deposit, which increased $2.5 billion, or 14.1%, and interest checking, which increased $247 million, or 14.9% During the first quarter of 2006, BB&T's banking network generated more than 49,000 net new transaction accounts.

This press release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). BB&T's management uses these "non-GAAP" measures in their analysis of the Corporation's performance. Non-GAAP measures typically adjust GAAP performance measures to exclude the effects of charges, expenses and gains related to the consummation of mergers and acquisitions, and costs related to the integration of merged entities, as well as the amortization of intangibles and purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments in the case of "cash basis" performance measures. These non-GAAP measures also exclude equity-based compensation in order to make the 2006 results comparable with prior periods presented and may also exclude other significant gains, losses or expenses that are unusual in nature and not expected to recur. Since these items and their impact on BB&T's performance are difficult to predict, management believes presentations of financial measures excluding the impact of these items provide useful supplemental information that is important for a proper understanding of the operating results of BB&T's core businesses. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.
