These results reflect increases of 10.9% and 12.9%, respectively, compared to the second quarter last year.
          BB&T's second quarter net income produced annualized returns on average assets and average shareholders' equity of 1.53% and 15.34%, respectively, compared to prior year returns of 1.50% and 14.04%, respectively.
          Operating earnings for the second quarter of 2006 totaled $436.3 million, or $.81 per diluted share, excluding $1.0 million in net after-tax merger-related charges and $6.2 million in after-tax equity-based compensation resulting from the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) effective Jan. 1. Operating earnings for the second quarter of 2005 totaled $413.2 million, excluding $26.4 million in net after-tax merger-related credits and nonrecurring charges. These results reflect increases of 5.6% and 8.0%, respectively, compared to the same period last year.
          Cash basis operating results exclude the unamortized balances of intangibles from assets and shareholders' equity, and exclude the amortization of intangibles, the net amortization of purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments, merger-related charges or credits, equity-based compensation and nonrecurring items from earnings. Cash basis operating earnings totaled $454.8 million for the second quarter of 2006, an increase of 4.3% compared to the second quarter of 2005. Cash basis operating diluted earnings per share totaled $.84 for the second quarter of 2006, an increase of 6.3% compared to $.79 earned during the same period in 2005. Cash basis operating earnings for the second quarter of 2006 produced annualized returns on average tangible assets and average tangible shareholders' equity of 1.70% and 28.96%, respectively, compared to prior year returns of 1.77% and 27.82%, respectively.
          "BB&T generated strong results for the second quarter of 2006 and I am very pleased with our growth in earnings and revenues, as well as our positive trends in loans and deposits," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John A. Allison. "Our earnings growth was driven by a 7.2% increase in revenues, including an 11.2% increase in noninterest income, and continued excellent asset quality.
          "The second quarter decline in our net interest margin was due to a continued flat yield curve environment and a management decision to more aggressively pursue retail deposits to fund loan growth and to fuel organic growth initiatives. While these events will negatively affect our margin, the resulting growth in deposit accounts will ultimately generate greater profitability.
          "While our industry faces a number of challenges, I am very optimistic about BB&T's current trends and strategic direction. I believe we are well-positioned to meet our performance goals for the year."
          For the first six months of 2006, BB&T's net income was $860.6 million, an increase of 10.0% compared to $782.2 million earned in the first six months of 2005. Diluted earnings per share for the first half of 2006 totaled $1.59, an increase of 12.0% compared to the same period in 2005. Excluding merger-related charges or credits, equity-based compensation and nonrecurring items, operating earnings for the first half of 2006 totaled $864.0 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, an increase of 7.1% and 8.9%, respectively, compared to the first six months of 2005.
BB&T's Noninterest Income up 11.2%
          Noninterest income from BB&T's fee generating businesses increased 11.2% during the second quarter of 2006 compared to 2005. Total noninterest income was $650.7 million for the current quarter and represents 40.8% of total revenues. This increase includes a record performance from BB&T's insurance operations, improved revenues from other nondeposit fees and commissions, and growth in mortgage banking income.
          Commissions from BB&T's insurance operations improved to a record $214.1 million earned in the current quarter. This reflects an increase of 17.9% compared with $181.6 million earned in the second quarter of 2005. The increase was the result of growth in commissions from the sale of property and casualty coverage, and improved sales of employee benefits-related insurance products.
          Other nondeposit fees and commissions totaled $111.5 million for the second quarter of 2006, an increase of 21.8% compared to the second quarter of 2005. This increase was generated primarily by growth in bankcard fees and debit card related services.
          Revenues from mortgage banking operations totaled $29.1 million for the second quarter of 2006 compared to $12.4 million earned in the second quarter last year. This increase was primarily the result of fluctuations in the fair value of residential mortgage servicing rights and the related derivative hedge, as well as increased revenues from commercial mortgage banking operations, which increased $3.0 million, or 55.5%, compared to the second quarter of 2005.
Asset Quality Remains Excellent
          BB&T's asset quality remains excellent as net charge-offs declined during the second quarter of 2006. Nonperforming assets, as a percentage of total assets, were .27% at both June 30 and Dec. 31, 2005, down from .29% at June 30, 2005. Annualized net charge-offs were .23% of average loans and leases for the second quarter of 2006, down from .25% in the second quarter of 2005. Excluding losses incurred by BB&T's specialized lending subsidiaries, annualized net charge-offs for the current quarter were .12% of average loans and leases compared to .16% in the same quarter last year.
Loan Growth Continues to be Robust  Up 10.8%
          Average loans and leases totaled $78.0 billion for the second quarter of 2006, reflecting an increase of $7.6 billion, or 10.8% compared to the second quarter of 2005. This increase was composed of growth in average commercial loans and leases, which increased $3.6 billion, or 10.5%; average mortgage loans, which increased $2.3 billion, or 17.6%; average consumer loans, which increased $963.5 million, or 4.7%; and growth in average loans originated by BB&T's specialized lending subsidiaries, which increased $693.0 million, or 27.8% compared to the second quarter last year.

Average retail deposit growth was led by client certificates of deposit, which increased $4.2 billion, or 24.2%, and interest checking, which increased $390.8 million, or 21.3% These increases reflect the Company's focus on growing retail deposits throughout its footprint.

This press release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). BB&T's management uses these "non-GAAP" measures in their analysis of the Corporation's performance. Non-GAAP measures typically adjust GAAP performance measures to exclude the effects of charges, expenses and gains related to the consummation of mergers and acquisitions, and costs related to the integration of merged entities, as well as the amortization of intangibles and purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments in the case of "cash basis" performance measures. These non-GAAP measures also exclude equity-based compensation in order to make the 2006 results comparable with prior periods presented and may also exclude other significant gains, losses or expenses that are unusual in nature and not expected to recur. Since these items and their impact on BB&T's performance are difficult to predict, management believes presentations of financial measures excluding the impact of these items provide useful supplemental information that is important for a proper understanding of the operating results of BB&T's core businesses. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.
