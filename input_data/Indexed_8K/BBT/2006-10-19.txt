FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BB&T reports 3rd quarter net income of $417.0 million
          WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.  BB&T Corporation (NYSE: BBT) reported today net income for the third quarter of 2006 totaling $417.0 million, or $.77 per diluted share, compared with $442.0 million, or $.80 per diluted share, earned during the third quarter of 2005. These results reflect decreases of 5.7% and 3.8%, respectively, compared to the third quarter last year. Third quarter earnings were negatively affected by a one-time charge related to an unforeseen legal matter totaling $9.8 million after-tax, or $.02 per diluted share.
          BB&T's third quarter net income produced annualized returns on average assets and average shareholders' equity of 1.42% and 14.39%, respectively, compared to prior year returns of 1.65% and 15.69%, respectively.
          Operating earnings for the third quarter of 2006 totaled $429.8 million, or $.79 per diluted share, excluding $6.2 million in net after-tax merger-related charges and $6.5 million in after-tax equity-based compensation. Operating earnings for the third quarter of 2005 totaled $440.9 million, excluding $1.1 million in net after-tax merger-related credits. These results reflect decreases of 2.5% and 1.3%, respectively, compared to the same period last year. Operating results were also reduced by $.02 per diluted share because of the aforementioned legal charge.
          Cash basis operating results exclude the unamortized balances of intangibles from assets and shareholders' equity, and exclude the amortization of intangibles, the net amortization of purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments, merger-related charges or credits, equity-based compensation and nonrecurring items from earnings. Cash basis operating earnings totaled $447.6 million for the third quarter of 2006, a decrease of 3.2% compared to the third quarter of 2005. Cash basis operating diluted earnings per share totaled $.82 for the third quarter of 2006, a decrease of 2.4% compared to $.84 earned during the same period in 2005. Cash basis operating earnings for the third quarter of 2006 produced annualized returns on average tangible assets and average tangible shareholders' equity of 1.59% and 28.53%, respectively, compared to prior year returns of 1.81% and 28.56%, respectively.
          "The challenging interest rate environment continued to erode our margins and the legal charge we incurred late in the quarter negatively affected our earnings," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John A. Allison. "While I am disappointed in our bottom-line results, I am pleased with a number of very positive trends in our performance. We experienced positive growth in loans and deposits, including a very favorable report on deposit market share released last week by the FDIC. Also, we enjoyed strong results from our investment banking division and our insurance operations, and continue to benefit from excellent asset quality levels and reasonable growth in total revenues."
          For the first nine months of 2006, BB&T's net income was $1.28 billion, an increase of 4.4% compared to $1.22 billion earned in the first nine months of 2005. Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of 2006 totaled $2.35, an increase of 5.9% compared to the same period in 2005. Excluding merger-related charges or credits, equity-based compensation and nonrecurring items, operating earnings for the first nine months of 2006 totaled $1.29 billion, or $2.38 per diluted share, increases of 3.7% and 5.3%, respectively, compared to the first nine months of 2005.
Deposits Grow 9.8% Compared to Last Year, BB&T Gains Deposit Market Share
          BB&T's deposit gathering efforts continued to be successful during the third quarter, as average deposits totaled $79.1 billion, an increase of 9.8% compared to $72.1 billion for the third quarter last year. Average client deposit growth was led by client certificates of deposit, which increased $5.8 billion, or 31.9%, and other client deposits, which increased $2.2 billion, or 7.5% compared to the third quarter of 2005. In addition, deposit growth accelerated during the third quarter, with annualized growth of 18.3% compared to the second quarter of 2006. During the first nine months of 2006, BB&T generated more than 115,000 net new transaction deposit accounts. According to the FDIC's "Summary of Deposits" report released last week, based on data for commercial banks, BB&T maintained its leading market share in West Virginia and gained market share in every other state in the Company's footprint. In addition, BB&T enjoyed double-digit deposit growth in six of the nine states where it has a significant presence.
BB&T Posts 11.5% Loan Growth during the Quarter
          Average loans and leases totaled $81.0 billion for the third quarter of 2006, reflecting an increase of $8.3 billion, or 11.5%, compared to the third quarter of 2005. This increase was composed of growth in average commercial loans and leases, which increased $4.5 billion, or 12.8%; average mortgage loans, which increased $1.9 billion, or 13.9%; average consumer loans, which increased $1.1 billion, or 5.4%; and growth in average loans originated by BB&T's specialized lending subsidiaries, which increased $742.6 million, or 28.2%, compared to the third quarter last year.
BB&T's Noninterest Income up 9.1%
          Noninterest income from BB&T's fee generating businesses increased 9.1% during the third quarter of 2006 compared to 2005. Total noninterest income was $660.2 million for the current quarter and represented 40.8% of total revenues. This increase includes a record performance from BB&T's investment banking and brokerage operations, as well as increased revenues from BB&T's insurance operations, other nondeposit fees and commissions, and trust operations.
          BB&T's investment banking and brokerage operations enjoyed record results in the current quarter as fees increased 18.1% to $82.7 million compared to $70.0 million earned in the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily driven by growth in revenues at BB&T Capital Markets, a division of Scott & Stringfellow.
          Commissions from BB&T's insurance operations increased 13.6% to $207.8 million in the current quarter compared with $182.9 million earned in the third quarter of 2005. This increase was the result of growth in commissions from the sale of property and casualty coverage, and improved sales of employee benefits-related insurance products.
          Other nondeposit fees and commissions totaled $115.0 million for the third quarter of 2006, an increase of 18.3% compared to the third quarter of 2005. This increase was generated primarily by growth in debit card related services.
          Trust revenues increased 8.6% to $39.7 million in the third quarter of 2006 compared with $36.6 million earned in the third quarter of 2005. This increase was primarily attributable to improved performance from institutional trust services and wealth management.
          Revenues from mortgage banking operations totaled $22.6 million for the third quarter of 2006 compared to $35.8 million earned in the third quarter last year. This decrease was primarily the result of fluctuations in the fair value of residential mortgage servicing rights and the related derivative hedge. Third quarter 2006 revenues include a net decrease in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights of $.5 million compared to a net increase in fair value of $11.0 million in the third quarter last year.
Asset Quality Remains Excellent
          BB&T's asset quality remains excellent. Nonperforming assets, as a percentage of total assets, were .28% at Sept. 30 compared to .27% at Dec. 31, 2005, and .28% at Sept. 30, 2005. Annualized net charge-offs were .27% of average loans and leases for the third quarter of 2006, down from .30% in the third quarter of 2005. Excluding losses incurred by BB&T's specialized lending subsidiaries, annualized net charge-offs for the current quarter were .14% of average loans and leases compared to .19% in the same quarter last year.
BB&T Recognized Nationally for Home Mortgage Customer Service
          On July 19, the J.D. Power and Associates 2006 Primary Mortgage Servicer Study was released and BB&T Corporation ranked first in the nation among banks in home mortgage customer service satisfaction.

BB&T Expands Specialized Lending Business
          On Aug. 24, BB&T Corporation announced plans to acquire insurance premium finance company AFCO Credit Corporation and its Canadian affiliate, CAFO Inc.

The acquisition provides BB&T with significant opportunities to increase the number of consumer and small business loans in First Citizens' markets, as well as to develop additional commercial lending relationships.

This press release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). BB&T's management uses these "non-GAAP" measures in their analysis of the Corporation's performance. Non-GAAP measures typically adjust GAAP performance measures to exclude the effects of charges, expenses and gains related to the consummation of mergers and acquisitions, and costs related to the integration of merged entities, as well as the amortization of intangibles and purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments in the case of "cash basis" performance measures. These non-GAAP measures also exclude equity-based compensation in order to make the 2006 results comparable with prior periods presented and may also exclude other significant gains, losses or expenses that are unusual in nature and not expected to recur. Since these items and their impact on BB&T's performance are difficult to predict, management believes presentations of financial measures excluding the impact of these items provide useful supplemental information that is important for a proper understanding of the operating results of BB&T's core businesses. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.
