ITEM 8.01   Other Events
          BB&T has an established Market Risk and Liquidity Committee ("MRLC"), which meets regularly to review BB&T's interest rate risk and liquidity positions in relation to present and prospective market and business conditions, and adopts funding and balance sheet management strategies that are intended to ensure that the potential impact on earnings and liquidity of fluctuations in interest rates is within internal policy guidelines. During the fourth quarter, the MRLC performed a review of BB&T's securities portfolio in response to changing market conditions and the expected consolidation of BB&T's three subsidiary banks with the following specific goals:
          As a result of this review, management has restructured a portion of BB&T's securities portfolio. The restructuring resulted in the sale of approximately $2.5 billion of securities available for sale at an aggregate pre-tax loss of approximately $75 million, or $.09 per diluted share on an after-tax basis. The $75 million pre-tax loss is expected to be substantially recovered by the end of 2007 through higher net interest income. BB&T has replaced substantially all of the assets sold with higher-yielding securities.
          The resulting net realized losses on the sale of securities were previously reflected as net unrealized losses within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the shareholders' equity section of BB&T's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Accordingly, total shareholders' equity is not expected to change as a result of these actions.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
