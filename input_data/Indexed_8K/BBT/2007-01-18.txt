FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BB&T reports 2006 net income of $1.53 billion;
Operating earnings per share total $.82 for the fourth quarter
          WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.  BB&T Corporation (NYSE: BBT) reported today earnings for the fourth quarter and the full year 2006. For the fourth quarter, net income totaled $250.8 million, or $.46 per diluted share, compared with $429.6 million, or $.78 per diluted share, earned during the fourth quarter of 2005.
          Fourth quarter net income was negatively affected by a $139.1 million after-tax charge associated with providing additional tax reserves related to leveraged lease transactions, $46.9 million in after-tax losses resulting from a previously-announced restructuring of a portion of the securities portfolio, $5.6 million in net after-tax merger-related charges and $6.5 million in after-tax equity-based compensation.
          Excluding the impact of these items, operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2006 totaled $448.9 million, or $.82 per diluted share, compared with fourth quarter 2005 operating earnings of $425.8 million, or $.78 per diluted share, which exclude $3.8 million in net after-tax merger-related credits. 2006 operating results reflect increases of 5.4% and 5.1%, respectively, compared to the same period last year.
          For the full year 2006, BB&T's net income was $1.53 billion compared to $1.65 billion earned in 2005. Diluted earnings per share for 2006 totaled $2.81, a decrease of 6.3% compared to $3.00 earned in 2005. Excluding net after-tax merger-related charges or credits, equity-based compensation and nonrecurring items from 2006 and 2005, operating earnings for 2006 totaled $1.74 billion, an increase of 4.1% compared to operating earnings of $1.67 billion in 2005. Diluted operating earnings per share totaled $3.20 in 2006, an increase of 5.3% compared to $3.04 earned in 2005.
          Cash basis operating results exclude the unamortized balances of intangibles from assets and shareholders' equity, and exclude the amortization of intangibles, the net amortization of purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments, merger-related charges or credits, equity-based compensation and nonrecurring items from earnings. Cash basis operating earnings totaled $467.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, an increase of 4.1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2005. Cash basis operating diluted earnings per share totaled $.85 for the fourth quarter of 2006, an increase of 3.7% compared to $.82 earned during the same period in 2005. Cash basis operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2006 produced annualized returns on average tangible assets and average tangible shareholders' equity of 1.63% and 27.87%, respectively, compared to prior year returns of 1.73% and 27.88%, respectively.
          "I am pleased to report strong operating results for the fourth quarter of 2006," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John A. Allison. "2006 operating results represent the 25th consecutive year that BB&T has achieved record operating earnings. I am particularly pleased with our core trends in light of the difficult interest rate environment and slowing real estate market. Our performance reflects solid production from our lending and deposit gathering efforts, as well as healthy growth in many of our fee income producing businesses.
          "We are disappointed by the unexpected court ruling related to our lawsuit against the Internal Revenue Service that was issued early this month. While we disagree with the judge's decision, we are required to record additional reserves in the fourth quarter. Even so, our core trends are positive and, on an operating basis, the fourth quarter is the most profitable in our history."
Client Deposits Grow 13.5% Compared to Last Year
          BB&T's deposit gathering efforts continued to be successful during the fourth quarter, as average client deposits increased 13.5% compared to the fourth quarter last year. Average total client deposits were $72.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to $64.2 billion for the same period of 2005. Total average deposits for the fourth quarter were $79.9 billion, an increase of 9.5% compared to $72.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2005. During the year, BB&T generated approximately 122,000 net new transaction deposit accounts.
BB&T Continues to Enjoy Strong Loan Growth - Up 11.3% for the Quarter
          Average loans and leases totaled $82.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2006, reflecting an increase of $8.4 billion, or 11.3%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2005. This increase was composed of growth in average commercial loans and leases, which increased $4.5 billion, or 12.5%; average mortgage loans, which increased $1.7 billion, or 11.9%; average consumer loans, which increased $1.3 billion, or 6.2%; and growth in average loans originated by BB&T's specialized lending subsidiaries, which increased $823.4 million, or 30.0%, compared to the fourth quarter last year.
BB&T's Fee Based Businesses Produce Solid Quarterly Growth Rates
          Noninterest income, excluding securities gains and losses, increased $56.2 million, or 9.1%, during the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to 2005. These increases include higher revenues from BB&T's insurance operations and other nondeposit fees and commissions, as well as solid performances from BB&T's investment banking and brokerage operations and trust operations while revenues from service charges on deposit accounts and mortgage banking operations decreased slightly during the quarter.
          Commissions from BB&T's insurance operations increased 8.7% to a record $214.5 million in the current quarter compared with $197.4 million earned in the fourth quarter of 2005. This increase was the result of growth in commissions from the sale of property and casualty coverage, and improved sales of employee benefits-related insurance products.
          Other nondeposit fees and commissions totaled $115.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, an increase of 15.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2005. This increase was generated primarily by growth in debit card related services.
          BB&T's investment banking and brokerage operations enjoyed a solid quarter as fees increased 7.6% to $75.0 million compared to $69.7 million earned in the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily driven by growth in revenues at Scott & Stringfellow.
          Trust revenues increased 6.8% to $39.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared with $36.9 million earned in the fourth quarter of 2005. This increase was primarily attributable to improved performance from the wealth management division.
Asset Quality Remains Excellent
          BB&T continued to enjoy very healthy asset quality during the fourth quarter. Nonperforming assets, as a percentage of total assets, were .29% at Dec. 31, 2006, compared to .28% at Sept. 30, 2006, and .27% at Dec. 31, 2005. Annualized net charge-offs were .33% of average loans and leases for the fourth quarter of 2006, down from .37% in the fourth quarter of 2005. Excluding losses incurred by BB&T's specialized lending subsidiaries, annualized net charge-offs for the current quarter were .18% of average loans and leases compared to .25% in the same quarter last year.
BB&T Completes Securities Restructuring
          During the fourth quarter of 2006, BB&T restructured a portion of its securities portfolio. The restructuring resulted in the sale of approximately $2.5 billion of securities available for sale at an aggregate pre-tax loss of $74.5 million, or $.09 per diluted share on an after-tax basis. BB&T has replaced substantially all of the assets sold with higher-yielding securities and expects to recover the $74.5 million loss through higher earnings by the end of 2007.
Income Taxes
          On Jan. 4, the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina issued a summary judgment in favor of the Internal Revenue Service related to BB&T Corporation's treatment of a leveraged lease transaction entered into in 1997. BB&T filed the lawsuit to pursue a refund of $3.3 million in taxes plus interest. BB&T's management disagrees with the decision and intends to appeal the matter to the United States Appeals Court for the Fourth Circuit, based in Richmond, Virginia.
          Due to the timing of the District Court's ruling and its potential impact on BB&T's other leveraged lease transactions, BB&T recorded additional tax reserves totaling $139.1 million, after-tax, in the fourth quarter of 2006.
BB&T Expands Presence in Excellent Markets - Acquires Coastal Financial Corporation
          On Dec. 21, 2006, BB&T announced plans to acquire Coastal Financial Corporation of Myrtle Beach, S.C. for $394.6 million in stock. The merger would give BB&T the No. 1 deposit market share in the thriving metro Myrtle Beach, S.C. market. With $1.7 billion in assets, Coastal Financial operates 17 banking offices in the greater Myrtle Beach area and seven in greater Wilmington, N.C., where BB&T already has the No. 1 market share. The merger, which is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2007.
          At Dec. 31, 2006, BB&T had $121.4 billion in assets and operated 1,459 banking offices in the Carolinas, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Georgia, Maryland, Tennessee, Florida, Alabama, Indiana and Washington, D.C. BB&T's common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol BBT. The closing price of BB&T's common stock on Jan. 17 was $42.74 per share.

This press release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). BB&T's management uses these "non-GAAP" measures in their analysis of the Corporation's performance. Non-GAAP measures typically adjust GAAP performance measures to exclude the effects of charges, expenses and gains related to the consummation of mergers and acquisitions, and costs related to the integration of merged entities, as well as the amortization of intangibles and purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments in the case of "cash basis" performance measures. These non-GAAP measures also exclude equity-based compensation in order to make the 2006 results comparable with prior periods presented and may also exclude other significant gains, losses or expenses that are unusual in nature and not expected to recur. Since these items and their impact on BB&T's performance are difficult to predict, management believes presentations of financial measures excluding the impact of these items provide useful supplemental information that is important for a proper understanding of the operating results of BB&T's core businesses. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.
