WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. -- BB&T Corporation (NYSE: BBT) reported today net income for the first quarter of 2007 totaling $421 million, or $.77 per diluted share, compared with $431 million, or $.79 per diluted share, earned during the first quarter of 2006. These results reflect decreases of 2.3% and 2.5%, respectively, compared to the first quarter last year.
     
BB&T's first quarter net income produced annualized returns on average assets and average shareholders' equity of 1.41% and 14.81%, respectively, compared to prior year returns of 1.60% and 15.72%, respectively.
     
Operating earnings for the first quarter of 2007 totaled $425 million, or $.78 per diluted share, excluding $4 million in net after-tax merger-related and restructuring charges. Operating earnings for the first quarter of 2006 totaled $411 million, excluding an $18 million after-tax gain from the sale of duplicate facilities and $2 million in net after-tax merger-related credits. These results reflect increases of 3.4% and 2.6%, respectively, compared to the same period last year.
     
Cash basis operating results exclude the unamortized balances of intangibles from assets and shareholders' equity and exclude the amortization of intangibles, the net amortization of purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments, merger-related and restructuring charges or credits and nonrecurring items from earnings. Cash basis operating earnings totaled $441 million for the first quarter of 2007, an increase of 2.6% compared to the first quarter of 2006.

 interest rate environment and a slowing economy," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John A. Allison. "We continue to experience solid loan and deposit growth and have healthy asset quality. I am also pleased with the progress we made this quarter in operating efficiency, which improved to 52.1% on a cash basis, generating positive operating leverage of 6.2% compared with the fourth quarter of last year. Considering that our first quarter typically includes a number of adverse seasonal factors, I am encouraged that these results represent a good start for 2007."
     "Overall, I am pleased with our first quarter performance, particularly in light of a challenging 
BB&T's Fee-Based Businesses Enjoy Strong Quarterly Growth
     BB&T's noninterest income generating businesses produced solid growth rates during the first quarter of 2007 compared to 2006. Total noninterest income was $652 million for the current quarter, an increase of 7.2% compared with the same period in 2006. This increase includes improved revenues from insurance operations, trust services, service charges on deposit accounts, and other nondeposit fees and commissions.
BB&T's insurance operations continue to expand through acquisitions and internal growth and are the largest provider of noninterest income. Insurance commissions increased 11.9% to $197 million in the current quarter compared with $176 million earned during the first quarter last year. This increase was primarily the result of increased commissions from the sale of property and casualty coverage.
     
Trust revenues increased 8.1% to $40 million in the first quarter of 2007 compared with $37 million earned in the first quarter of 2006. This increase was primarily driven by improved performance in BB&T's Wealth Management division.
     
Service charges on deposit accounts totaled $138 million for the first quarter of 2007, an increase of 5.3% compared to $131 million earned in the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily attributable to growth in revenues from overdraft items.
     
Other nondeposit fees and commissions totaled $114 million for the first quarter of 2007, an increase of 11.8% compared to the first quarter of 2006. This increase was generated primarily by growth in check card-related services.
     
Asset Quality Remains Excellent
BB&T's asset quality remained excellent during the first quarter of 2007. Nonperforming assets, as a percentage of total assets, were .30% at March 31 and .29% at Dec. 31, 2006, compared to .27% at March 31, 2006. Annualized net charge-offs were .29% of average loans and leases for the first quarter of 2007, up slightly from .26% in the first quarter of 2006, but down from .33% in the fourth quarter of 2006. Excluding losses incurred by BB&T's specialized lending subsidiaries, annualized net charge-offs were .13% of average loans and leases for the current quarter and the first quarter last year.
     
BB&T Produces Positive Operating Leverage Driven By Improved Expense Control
BB&T produced positive operating leverage of 6.2% on an annualized basis during the first quarter of 2007 compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 and 2.6% compared to the first quarter last year. These results were driven primarily by better expense control. BB&T's noninterest expenses totaled $883 million for the first quarter of 2007, a decrease of 17.2%, compared to $922 million for the fourth quarter of 2006. Excluding merger-related and restructuring charges or credits, nonrecurring items and growth resulting from purchase acquisitions, noninterest expenses decreased 19.4% on an annualized basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 and 1.0% compared to the first quarter of 2006. The decline in noninterest expenses is attributable to BB&T's greater emphasis on cost control for 2007.
     
Combined Loan and Deposit Growth Remains Strong
Average loans and leases totaled $84.9 billion for the first quarter of 2007, reflecting an increase of $9.5 billion, or 12.5%, compared to the first quarter of 2006. This increase was composed of growth in average commercial loans and leases, which increased $4.2 billion, or 11.4%, average mortgage loans, which increased $1.8 billion, or 12.4%, average consumer loans, which increased $1.4 billion, or 6.5%, and growth in average loans originated by BB&T's specialized lending subsidiaries, which increased $2.0 billion, or 71.9%, compared to the first quarter last year. The growth in loans originated by BB&T's specialized lending subsidiaries was primarily driven by the acquisition of AFCO Credit Corporation, which added approximately $1.2 billion in loans. Excluding the impact of this acquisition, average loans in BB&T's specialized lending group increased 25.5% compared to the first quarter last year.
     
Average deposits totaled $82.5 billion for the first quarter of 2007, an increase of 11.2% compared to $74.2 billion for the first quarter of 2006. Total average client deposits totaled $73.6 billion for the first quarter of 2007, an increase of 12.7% compared to $65.3 billion for the first quarter of 2006. Average retail deposit growth was led by client certificates of deposit, which increased $5.2 billion, or 26.0%, and other client deposits, which increased $2.7 billion, or 8.8%

BB&T's banking network generated approximately 5,000 net new transaction accounts via the new online account opening system during the first quarter of 2007.

This press release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). BB&T's management uses these "non-GAAP" measures in their analysis of the Corporation's performance. Non-GAAP measures typically adjust GAAP performance measures to exclude the effects of charges, expenses and gains related to the consummation of mergers and acquisitions, and costs related to the integration of merged entities, as well as the amortization of intangibles and purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments in the case of "cash basis" performance measures. These non-GAAP measures may also exclude other significant gains, losses or expenses that are unusual in nature and not expected to recur. Since these items and their impact on BB&T's performance are difficult to predict, management believes presentations of financial measures excluding the impact of these items provide useful supplemental information that is important for a proper understanding of the operating results of BB&T's core businesses. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.
