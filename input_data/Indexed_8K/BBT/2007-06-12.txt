(b) If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Offerors to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Offerors will reimburse the Underwriters severally through the Representatives on demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
8.
Indemnification and Contribution
.
     
(a) The Offerors agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or in any amendment thereof, or arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action;
provided
,
however
, that the Offerors will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Offerors by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Offerors may otherwise have.
     
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Offerors, each of their respective directors or trustees, each of their officers and each person who controls either Offeror within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Offerors to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Offerors by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which
any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Offerors acknowledge that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading Underwriting or Plan of Distribution, (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances, (iii) the sentences related to transactions in discretionary accounts and (iv) the paragraph related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which each Underwriter may otherwise have.
     
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying partys choice at the indemnifying partys expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below);
provided
,
however
, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying partys election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless
such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
     
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Offerors and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively, 
Losses
) to which the Offerors and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Offerors on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Offerors and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Offerors on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations;
provided
,
however
, that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. Benefits received by the Offerors shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Offerors on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Offerors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee, agent and partner of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Offerors within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Offerors who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Offerors shall have the same rights to contribution as the Offerors, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
     
9.
Default by an Underwriter
. If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase;
provided
,
however
, that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Offerors. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Offerors and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
     
10.
Termination
. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Offerors prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time (i) there has been, since the time of execution of this Underwriting Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus, any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of any Offerors and their Subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, (ii) trading in the Companys common stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (iii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared by Federal, New York State or State of North Carolina authorities, (iv) there shall have occurred a material disruption in settlement and clearing services, or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis, the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement subsequent to the date hereof).

(iv) Until the Debentures are paid in full, the Corporation will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts, subject to a Market Disruption Event:
     
(A) to raise sufficient net proceeds from the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities during a 180-day period ending on the date, not more than 30 and not less than 10 Business Days before the Scheduled Maturity Date, on which the Corporation delivers the notice required by clause (v) of this Section 2.2(a) and Section 3.1, to permit repayment of the Debentures in full on the Scheduled Maturity Date pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 2.2(a); and
     
(B) if the Corporation is unable for any reason to raise sufficient net proceeds from the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities to permit repayment in full of the Debentures on the Scheduled Maturity Date (as required by clause (A) above) or any subsequent Interest Payment Date, to raise sufficient net proceeds from the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities during a 180-day period ending on the date, not more than 30 and not less than 10 Business Days before the following Interest Payment Date, on which the Corporation delivers the notice required by clause (v) of this Section 2.2(a) and Section 3.1, to permit repayment of the Debentures in full on such following Interest Payment Date pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 2.2(a) .

Certificate further certifies that: (A) a Market Disruption Event was existing during the 180-day period preceding the date of such Officers' Certificate or, in the case of any Repayment Date after the Scheduled Maturity Date, the 30-day period preceding the date of such Officers' Certificate; and (B) either (1) the Market Disruption Event continued for the entire 180- or 30-day period, as the case may be, or (2) the Market Disruption Event continued for only part of the period, but the Corporation was unable after Commercially Reasonable Efforts to raise sufficient net proceeds during the rest of that period to permit repayment of the Debentures in full pursuant to clause (iv) above.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Corporation raises less than $5 million of net proceeds from the sale of Qualifying Capital Securities during the relevant 180- or 30-day period, as the case may be, the Corporation will not be required to repay any Debentures on the applicable Repayment Date or the next Interest Payment Date, as applicable, but the Corporation will use those net proceeds as provided in the preceding sentence to repay the Debentures on the next Interest Payment date as of which it has raised at least $5 million of net proceeds.

Upon any such presentation, the Corporation shall execute a Global Security in such aggregate principal amount and deliver the same to the Trustee for authentication and delivery in accordance with the Indenture and this Third Supplemental Indenture. Payments on the Debentures issued as a Global Security will be made to the Depositary; and
     
(ii) if any Capital Securities are held in certificated form and not in book-entry form, the Debentures in certificated form may be presented to the Trustee by the Property Trustee and any Capital Security Certificate which represents Capital Securities other than Capital Securities held by the Clearing Agency or its nominee ("
    
Non-Book-Entry Capital Securities

be, with an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of the Capital Security Certificate canceled, will be executed by the Corporation and delivered to the Trustee for authentication and delivery in accordance with the Indenture and this Third Supplemental Indenture. On issue of such Debentures, Debentures with an equivalent aggregate principal amount that were presented by the Property Trustee to the Trustee will be deemed to have been canceled.
A Global Security may be transferred, in whole but not in part, only to another nominee of the Depositary, or to a successor Depositary selected or approved by the Corporation or to a nominee of such successor Depositary.
     
If at any time the Depositary notifies the Corporation that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary or if at any time the Depositary shall no longer be registered or in good standing under the Exchange Act or other applicable statute or regulation, and a successor Depositary for such series is not appointed by the Corporation within 90 days after the Corporation receives such notice or becomes aware of such condition, as the case may be, the Corporation will execute, and, subject to Article III of the Indenture, the Trustee, upon written notice from the Corporation, will authenticate and make available for delivery the Debentures in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security in exchange for such Global Security. In addition, the Corporation may at any time determine that the Debentures shall no longer be represented by a Global Security. In such event the Corporation will execute, and subject to Article III of the Indenture, the Trustee will authenticate and deliver the Debentures in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security in exchange for such Global Security. Upon the exchange of the Global Security for such Debentures in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, the Global Security shall be canceled by the Trustee. Such Debentures in definitive registered form issued in exchange for the Global Security shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee.

that such payments are made in accordance with Section 2.7(c) to the extent it applies, or (8) any payment during a Deferral Period of principal in respect of Parity Securities having the same scheduled maturity date as the Scheduled Maturity Date as the Debentures, as required under a provision of such other Parity Securities that is substantially the same as the provision described under Section 2.2, and that is made on a
pro rata
basis among one or more series of Parity Securities (including the Debentures) having such a provision. The distribution restrictions and exceptions in this Section 2.6 will be in lieu of the distribution restrictions and exception s in Section 3.12 of the Indenture.
     
(b)
Additional Limitation upon Deferral Lasting over One Year
. If any Deferral Period lasts longer than one year, neither the Corporation nor any Subsidiary of the Corporation will repurchase or acquire any securities ranking junior to or
pari passu
with any APM Qualifying Securities the proceeds of which were used to settle deferred interest during the relevant Deferral Period before the first anniversary of the date on which all deferred interest on the Debentures has been paid, subject to the exceptions listed in clauses (1) through (8) of the proviso to Section 2.6(a);
provided, however
, if the Corporation is involved in a Business Combination where immediately after its consummation more than 50% of the voting stock of the Person formed by such Business Combination, or the Person t hat is the surviving entity of such Business Combination, or the Person to whom such properties and assets are conveyed, transferred or leased in such Business Combination, is owned by the shareholders of the other party to such Business Combination, then the limitation set forth in this Section 2.6(b) will not apply to any Deferral Period that is terminated on the next Interest Payment Date following the date of consummation of such Business Combination.
2.7
Alternative Payment Mechanism
.
     
(a)
Obligation to Issue APM Qualifying Securities
. Commencing not later than the earlier of (i) the first Interest Payment Date following the commencement of any Deferral Period on which the Corporation pays any current interest on the Debentures from any source of funds or (ii) the fifth anniversary of the commencement of such Deferral Period, the Corporation shall, subject to the occurrence and continuation of a Supervisory Event or a Market Disruption Event as described under Section 2.7(b) and subject to Section 2.5(c), issue one or more types of APM Qualifying Securities until the Corporation has raised an amount of Eligible Proceeds at least equal to the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid deferred interest on the Debentures and applied such Eligible Proceeds on the next Interest Payment Date to the payment of deferred interest in accordance with Section 2.5,
provided
that:
     
     
(i) the foregoing obligations will not apply to the extent that, with respect to deferred interest attributable to the first five years of any Deferral Period, the net proceeds of any issuance of Common Stock (or Qualifying Warrants if the definition of APM Qualifying Securities has been modified to exclude Common Stock) applied during such Deferral Period to pay interest on
 
the Debentures pursuant to this Section 2.7, together with the net proceeds of all prior issuances of Common Stock and Qualifying Warrants so applied during such Deferral Period, would exceed an amount equal to 2% of the product of the average of the Current Stock Market Prices of the Common Stock on the 10 consecutive Trading Days ending on the second Trading Day immediately preceding the date of issuance multiplied by the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the date of the Corporation's then most recent publicly available consolidated financial statements (the "
Common Stock Issuance Cap
");
provided
that the Common Stock Issuance Cap will cease to apply after the ninth anniversary of the commencement of any Deferral Period, at which point the Corporation must pay any deferred interest regardless of the time at which it was deferred, pursuant to this Section 2.7, subject to the Maximum Share Number and any Supervisory Event or Market Disruption Event; and
provided, further
, that if the Common Stock Issuance Cap is reached during a Deferral Period and the Corporation subsequently repays all deferred interest, the Common Stock Issuance Cap will cease to apply at the termination of such Deferral Period and will not apply again unless and until the Corporation starts a new Deferral Period; and
     
(ii) the Corporation shall not be permitted to issue Qualifying Preferred Stock to pay deferred interest on the Debentures, and the foregoing obligations will not apply, to the extent that the net proceeds of any issuance of Qualifying Preferred Stock applied to pay interest on the Debentures pursuant to this Section 2.7, together with the net proceeds of all prior issuances of Qualifying Preferred Stock so applied during the current and all prior Deferral Periods, would exceed 25% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debentures (the "
Preferred Stock Issuance Cap
"); and
     
(iii) the Corporation shall not be obligated to sell more than 20 million shares of Common Stock (such number, as it may be adjusted from time to time, the "
Maximum Share Number
") for purposes of paying deferred interest on the Debentures;
provided
that if the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction, then the Maximum Share Number shall be correspondingly adjusted. The Corporation may, in its discretion and without the consent of the Holders of the Debentures, increase the Maximum Share Number (including through the increase of the Corporation's authorized share capital, i f necessary) if the Corporation determines that such increase is necessary to allow it to issue sufficient shares of Common Stock to pay deferred interest on the Debentures.
For the avoidance of doubt, (x) once the Corporation reaches the Common Stock Issuance Cap for a Deferral Period, the Corporation will not be required to issue more Common Stock (or Qualifying Warrants if the definition of APM Qualifying Securities has been modified to exclude Common Stock) with respect to deferred interest attributable to the first five years of such Deferral Period pursuant to this Section 2.7,
 
even if the amount referred to in clause (i) of the proviso to this Section 2.7(a) subsequently increases because of a subsequent increase in the Current Stock Market Price of Common Stock or the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, and (y) so long as the definition of APM Qualifying Securities has not been amended to eliminate Common Stock, the sale of Qualifying Warrants to pay deferred interest is an option that may be exercised at the Corporation's sole discretion and the Corporation is not obligated to sell Qualifying Warrants or to apply the proceeds of any such sale to pay deferred interest on the Debentures, and no class of investors in the Corporation's securities, or any other party, may require the Corporation to issue Qualifying Warrants.
     
(b)
Market Disruption Event and Supervisory Event
. Section 2.7(a) will not apply with respect to any Interest Payment Date if the Corporation shall have provided to the Trustee (and to the Property Trustee of the Trust to the extent the Trust is the sole Holder of the Debentures) no more than 15 and no less than 10 Business Days before such Interest Payment Date an Officers' Certificate stating that (i) a Market Disruption Event or Supervisory Event was existing after the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date and (ii) either (x) the Market Disruption Event or Supervisory Event continued for the entire period from the Business Day immediately following the preceding Interest Payment Date to the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which such Officers' Certificate is provided or (y) the Market Disruption Event or Supervisory Event continued for only part of such period b ut the Corporation was unable to raise sufficient Eligible Proceeds during the rest of that period to pay all accrued and unpaid interest due on the Interest Payment Date with respect to which such Officers' Certificate is being delivered or (z) the Supervisory Event prevents the Corporation from applying the net proceeds of sales of APM Qualifying Securities to pay deferred interest on such Interest Payment Date.
(c)
Partial Payment of Deferred Interest
.
     
    
(i) If the Corporation has raised some but not all Eligible Proceeds necessary to pay all deferred interest on any Interest Payment Date pursuant to this Section 2.7, such Eligible Proceeds will be allocated to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the applicable Interest Payment Date in chronological order based on the date each payment was first deferred, subject to the Common Stock Issuance Cap, the Preferred Stock Issuance Cap and the Maximum Share Number, and payment on each installment of deferred interest will be distributed to Holders on a pro rata basis.
     
    
(ii) If the Corporation has outstanding Parity Securities under which the Corporation is obligated to sell securities that are APM Qualifying Securities and apply the net proceeds to the payment of deferred interest or distributions, then on any date and for any period the amount of net proceeds received by the Corporation from those sales and available for payment of the deferred interest and distributions will be applied to the Debentures and those other Parity Securities on a pro rata basis up to the Maximum Share Number or the Common Stock Issuance Cap or the Preferred Stock Issuance Cap, as applicable (or comparable provisions in the instruments governing those other Parity Securities)
 
in proportion to the total amounts that are due on the Debentures and such other Parity Securities, or on such other basis as the Federal Reserve may approve.
     
(d)
APM Qualifying Securities Definition Change
. The Corporation will send written notice to the Trustee (which notice the Trustee will promptly forward upon receipt to the Administrative Trustees, who will forward such notice to each holder of record of Capital Securities) prior to the effective date of any change in the definition of APM Qualifying Securities to eliminate Common Stock or Qualifying Warrants.
2.8

In all other cases, the redemption price will equal the applicable Make-Whole Redemption Price. The Corporation will notify the Trust of the applicable Make-Whole Redemption Price (if applicable) promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee will have no responsibility for calculating the Make-Whole Redemption Price. The Corporation may not redeem the Debentures in part if the principal amount of the Debentures has been accelerated and such acceleration has not been rescinded or unless all accrued and unpaid interest including deferred interest has been paid in full on all outstanding Debentures for all Interest Periods terminating on or before the Redemption Date. Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least thirty (30) days but not more than sixty (60) days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of Debentures to be redeemed at its registered address.

In addition, the Trustee will provide to the holders of the Capital Securities notice of any Event of Default or event that, with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default with respect to the Debentures within 30 days after the actual knowledge of a Responsible Officer of the Trustee of such Event of Default or other event.
     
(d) For the avoidance of doubt, and without prejudice to any other remedies that may be available to the Trustee, the Holders of the Debentures or the holders of the Capital Securities under the Indenture, no breach by the Corporation of any covenant or obligation under the Indenture or the terms of the Debentures will be an Event of Default with respect to the Debentures other than those specified as Events of Default in Section 2.9(a) .

Principal Amount:
     
BB&T CORPORATION
, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of North Carolina (hereinafter called the "
Corporation
", which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to
[
 - 
]
, or registered assigns, the principal sum of
[
 - 
]
($
[
 - 
]
) and all accrued and unpaid interest thereof on June 12, 2077, or if such day is not a Business Day, the following Business Day (the "
Final Repaym ent Date
").
     
The Corporation further promises to pay interest on said principal sum from and including June 12, 2007, or from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date on which interest has been paid or duly provided for, until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment. Interest shall be payable (i) semi-annually in arrears on June 12 and December 12 of each year, beginning on December 12, 2007 until and including June 12, 2037, (ii) quarterly in arrears on March 12, June 12, September 12 and December 12 of each year, beginning on September 12, 2037 until and including June 12, 2057, and (iii) monthly in arrears on the 12th day of each month thereafter (each such date, an "
Interest Payment Date
"), at an annual rate of (i) 6.82% from and including June 12, 2007 to but excluding June 12, 2037, (ii) an annual rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 2.110%, from and including June 12, 2037 to but excluding June 12, 2057, and (iii) an annual rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 2.108% thereafter (computed on the basis of (i) a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months with respect to any Interest Period ending on or prior to June 12, 2037 and (ii) a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed with respect to any other Interest Period after June 12, 2037), plus Additional Interest, if any;
provided
,
however
, if any Interest Payment Date described in clauses (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the applicable Interest Payment Date shall instead occur on the immediately succeeding Business Day. Accrued interest that is not paid on the applicable Interest Payment Date (after giving effect to the adjustments described in the last sentence of Section 2.4(b) of the Third Supplemental Indenture), including interest deferred pursuant to Section 2.5 of the Third Supplemental Indenture, will bear Additional Interest, to the extent permitted by law, at the then-applicable rate described in the second sentence of this paragraph, from the relevant Interest Payment Date, compounded on each subsequent Interest Payment Date.
 
     
If any Interest Payment Date on or prior to the regularly scheduled Interest Payment Date in June, 2037 occurs on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of interest for such Interest Payment Date shall be made (or such interest shall be made available for payment) on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if such payment were made on the relevant Interest Payment Date. If any Interest Payment Date after the regularly scheduled Interest Payment Date in June, 2037 occurs on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of interest for such Interest Payment Date shall be made (or such interest shall be made available for payment) on the next succeeding Business Day and shall include interest or other payment in respect of the delay. A "
Business Day
" will mean any London Business Day other than a Saturday or Sunday, or a day on which banking in stitutions in New York City are authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed or a day on which the corporate trust offices of the Property Trustee or the Debenture Trustee is closed for business. A "
London Business Day
" means any day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted on the London interbank market. The interest installment so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest installment. Any such interest installment not so punctually paid or duly provided for (other than interest deferred in accordance with the next paragraph) will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Sec urity (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof will be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days before such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.
     
So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Corporation has the right at any time or from time to time during the term of this Security to defer payment of interest on this Security for one or more consecutive Interest Periods up to 10 years;
provided, however,
that no Deferral Period will extend beyond the Final Repayment Date or the earlier redemption of any Securities of this series. Upon the termination of any Deferral Period and upon the payment of all deferred interest then due, the Corporation may elect to begin a new Deferral Period, subject to the above requirements. Except as provided in Section 2.7 of the Third Supplemental Indenture, no interest will be due and payable during a Deferral Period except at the end thereof.
     
So long as any Securities remain outstanding, if the Corporation has given notice of its election to defer interest payments on the Securities but the related Deferral Period has not yet commenced or a Deferral Period is continuing, the Corporation will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary of the Corporation to, (i) declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to any shares of the Corporation's capital stock, (ii) make any payment of principal of or interest or premium, if any, on or repay, repurchase or redeem any debt securities or guarantees of the Corporation that rank upon the Corporation's liquidation on a parity with this Security (including this Security, the "
Parity Securities"
), or junior in interest to this Security (except for partial payments of interest with respect to the Security) or (iii) make any guarantee payments regarding any guarantee by the
 
Corporation of the junior subordinated debentures of any Subsidiary of the Corporation if the guarantee ranks
pari passu
with or junior in interest to the Debentures (other than (a) any repurchase, redemption or other acquisition of shares of the Corporation's capital stock by the Corporation in connection with (1) any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more of its employees, officers, directors, consultants or independent contractors, (2) a dividend reinvestment or stockholder purchase plan, (3) the issuance of the Corporation's capital stock, or securities convertible into or exercisable for such capital stock, as consideration in an acquisition transaction entered into before the applicable Deferral Period; (b) any exchange, redemption or conversion of any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock, or the capital stock of one of its subsidiaries, for any other class or series of the Corporation's capital stock, or any class or series of the Corporation's indebtedness for any class or series of its capital stock; (c) any purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Corporation's capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such capital stock or the securities being converted or exchanged; (d) any declaration of a dividend in connection with any stockholder rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any stockholder rights plan, or the redemption or purchase of rights pursuant thereto; (e) any payment by the Corporation under the Corporation's guarantee regarding the Trust holding the Debentures; (f) any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks equally with or junior to such stock; (g) any payment during a Deferral Period of current interest on Parity Securities that is made
pro rata
to the amounts due on such Parity Securities (including the Debentures), and any payments of deferred interest on Parity Securities that, if not made, would cause the Corporation to breach the terms of the instrument governing such Parity Securities
provided
that such payments are made in accordance with Section 2.7(c) of the Third Supplemental Indenture to the extent it applies, or (h) any payment during a Deferral Period of principal in respect of Parity Securities having the same scheduled maturity date as this Security, as required under a provision of such Parity Securities that is substantially the same as the provision described in Section 2.2 of the Third Supplemental Indenture, and that is made on a
pro rata
basis among one or m ore series of Parity Securities having such a provision). In addition, if any Deferral Period lasts longer than one year, the Corporation and its Subsidiaries will not repurchase or acquire any securities ranking junior to or
pari passu
with any of its APM Qualifying Securities the proceeds of which were used to settle deferred interest during the relevant Deferral Period before the first anniversary of the date on which all deferred interest on this Security has been paid, subject to the exceptions listed above.
     
The Corporation will give written notice of its election to begin or extend any Deferral Period, (x) if the Property Trustee, on behalf of the Trust, is the sole holder of the Securities, to the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee not more than 30 and at least five Business Days before the earlier of (A) the next succeeding date on which the distributions on the Capital Securities are payable and (B) the date the Property Trustee is required to give notice to holders of the Capital Securities of the record or payment date for the related distribution, or (y) if the Property Trustee, on behalf of the Trust, is not the sole Holder of the Securities, to Holders of the Securities and the Trustee no more than 30 and at least five Business Days before the next Interest Payment Date.
 
     
Payment of the principal of and interest on this Security will be made at the office or agency of the Corporation maintained for that purpose in the United States, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts;
provided, however,
that at the option of the Corporation payment of interest may be made (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address will appear in the Securities Register or (ii) by wire transfer in immediately available funds at the bank account number as may be designated by the Person entitled thereto as specified in the Securities Register in writing not less than ten days before the relevant Interest Payment Date.
     
The indebtedness evidenced by this Security is, to the extent provided in the Indenture, subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Debt, and this Security is issued subject to the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto. Each Holder of this Security, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and will be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination so provided and (c) appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. Each Holder hereof, by his acceptance hereof, waives all notice of the acceptance of the subordination provisions contained herein and in the Indenture by each holder of Senior Indebtedness, whether now outstanding or hereafter incurred, and waives reliance by each such holder upon said provisions.
     
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions will for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
     
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security will not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
     
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.

This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Corporation (herein called the "
Securities
"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under the Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of August 18, 2005 (herein called the "
Base Indenture
"), between the Corporation and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "
Trustee
"), as amended and supplemented by the Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of June 12, 2007, between the Corporation and the Trustee (the "
Third Supplemental Indenture
", and together with the Base Indenture, the "
Indenture
"), to which Indenture and all other indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Corporation and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. By the terms of the Indenture, the Securities are issuable in series that may vary as to amount, date of maturity, rate of interest, rank and in any other respect provided in the Indenture.
     
All terms used in this Security that are defined in the Indenture or in the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement, dated as of June 12, 2007, as amended (the "
Amended Trust Agreement
"), for BB&T Capital Trust IV among BB&T Corporation, as Depositor, Wilmington Trust Corporation, as the Delaware Trustee and U.S. Bank National Association as the Property Trustee, and the Administrative Trustees, will have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture or the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement, as the case may be.
     
This Security shall be redeemable, at the Corporation's option, at any time, including on or after the Scheduled Maturity Date. The Corporation may redeem this Security (i) in whole or in part at any time on or after June 12, 2037 (or if this day is not a Business Day, on the next Business Day) and (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within 90 days of the occurrence of a Capital Treatment Event or Investment Company Event, in each case at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of this Security to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date. In all other cases, the redemption price will equal the applicable Make-Whole Redemption Price. Securities of this series shall be subject to partial redemption only in the amount of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof.
     No sinking fund is provided for the Securities.
     
The Indenture contains provisions for satisfaction and discharge of the entire indebtedness of this Security upon compliance by the Corporation with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
     
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Corporation and the Trustee at any time to enter into a supplemental indenture or indentures for the purpose of modifying in any manner the rights and obligations of the Corporation and of the Holders of the Securities, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities to be affected by such supplemental indenture. The Indenture also
 
contains provisions permitting Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities, to waive compliance by the Corporation with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security will be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
     
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, if an Event of Default as described in Section 2.9(a)(i) of the Third Supplemental Indenture with respect to the Securities at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities may declare the entire principal amount and all accrued but unpaid interest of all the Securities to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Corporation (and to the Trustee if given by Holders);
provided
that, as described in Section 2.9(a)(i), if upon an Event of Default, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities fails to declare the entire principal and all accrued but unpaid interest of all the Securities to be immediately due and payable, the holders of at l east 25% in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities then outstanding shall have such right by a notice in writing to the Corporation and the Trustee; and upon any such declaration the principal amount of and the accrued but unpaid interest (including any Additional Interest); and on all the Securities will become immediately due and payable;
provided
that the payment of principal and interest (including any Additional Interest) on such Securities will remain subordinated to the extent provided in Article XIII of the Base Indenture and Section 7.1 of the Third Supplemental Indenture.
     
So long as any Securities are held by or on behalf of BB&T Capital Trust IV, any holder of the Capital Securities issued by BB&T Capital Trust IV shall have the right, upon (i) the breach by the Corporation of its obligations under Section 2.2(a)(iv) of the Third Supplemental Indenture to issue Qualifying Capital Securities or Section 2.7(a) of the Third Supplemental Indenture to issue APM Qualifying Securities or (ii) the occurrence of an Event of Default described in Section 2.9(a) of the Third Supplemental Indenture, to institute a suit directly against the Corporation (a) in the case of (i) above, to enforce such obligations or for such other remedies as may be available and (b) in the case of (ii) above, for enforcement of payment to such holder of principal of (premium, if any) and (subject to Section 3.8 of the Base Indenture) interest (including any Additional Interest) on the Securities having a principal amount equal to the aggreg ate Liquidation Amount (as defined in the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement) of such Capital Securities.
     
The Holder of this Security, by such Holder's acceptance hereof, agrees that if a Bankruptcy Event of the Corporation shall occur before the redemption or repayment of such Security, such Holder shall have no claim for, and thus no right to receive, any deferred interest pursuant to Section 2.5 of the Third Supplemental Indenture that has not been paid pursuant to Sections 2.5 and 2.7 of the Third Supplemental Indenture to the extent the amount of such interest, including compounded interest thereon, exceeds two years of accumulated and unpaid interest, including compounded interest thereon, on this Security.
 
     
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture will alter or impair the obligation of the Corporation, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
     
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Securities Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Corporation maintained under Section 10.2 of the Base Indenture duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Corporation and the Securities Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Corporation may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
     
Before due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Corporation, the Trustee and any agent of the Corporation or the Trustee will treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Corporation, the Trustee nor any such agent will be affected by notice to the contrary.
     
The Securities are issuable only in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
     
The Corporation and, by its acceptance of this Security or a beneficial interest therein, the Holder of, and any Person that acquires a beneficial interest in, this Security agree to treat for United States Federal income tax purposes the Securities as indebtedness of the Corporation.
     
THE INDENTURE AND THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

(c) In connection with the issuance and sale of the Capital Securities, the Depositor shall have the right and responsibility to assist the Issuer Trust with respect to, or effect on behalf of the Issuer Trust, the following (and any actions taken by the Depositor in furtherance of the following prior to the date of this Trust Agreement are hereby ratified and confirmed in all respects):
     
(i) the preparation and filing by the Issuer Trust with the Commission of and the execution on behalf of the Issuer Trust of a registration statement on the appropriate form in relation to the Capital Securities, including any amendments thereto;
     
(ii) the determination of the states in which to take appropriate action to qualify or register for sale all or part of the Capital Securities and the determination of any and all such acts, other than actions that must be taken by or on behalf of the Issuer Trust, and the advice to the Issuer Trust of actions they must take on behalf of the Issuer Trust, and the preparation for execution and filing of any documents to be executed and filed by the Issuer Trust or on behalf of the Issuer Trust, as the Depositor deems necessary or advisable in order to comply with the applicable laws of any such states;

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Administrative Trustees are authorized and directed to conduct the affairs of the Issuer Trust and to operate the Issuer Trust so that the Issuer Trust will not be deemed to be an "investment company" required to be registered under the Investment Company Act, and will not be taxable as a corporation or classified as other than a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes and so that the Debentures will be treated as indebtedness of the Depositor for United States Federal income tax purposes. In this connection, the Depositor and the Administrative Trustees are authorized to take any action, not inconsistent with applicable law, the Certificate of Trust or this Trust Agreement, that they determine in their discretion to be necessary or desirable for such purposes, as long as such action does not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of the Ho lders of the Outstanding Capital Securities. In no event shall the Depositor or the Issuer Trustees be liable to the Issuer Trust or the Holders for any failure to comply with this section that results from a change in law or regulation or in the interpretation thereof.
SECTION 2.8. Assets of Trust.
The assets of the Issuer Trust shall consist solely of the Trust Property.
SECTION 2.9. Title to Trust Property.

SECTION 3.1. Payment Account.
     
(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Property Trustee shall establish the Payment Account. The Property Trustee and its agents shall have exclusive control and sole right of withdrawal with respect to the Payment Account for the purpose of making deposits in and withdrawals from the Payment Account in accordance with this Trust Agreement.

(b) The Property Trustee shall deposit in the Payment Account, promptly upon receipt, all payments of principal of or interest on, and any other payments or proceeds with respect to, the Debentures. Amounts held in the Payment Account shall not be invested by the Property Trustee pending distribution thereof.
SECTION 4.1. Distributions.
     
(a) The Trust Securities represent undivided beneficial interests in the Trust Property, and Distributions (including of Additional Amounts) will be made on the Trust Securities at the rate and on the dates that payments of interest (including of Additional Interest, as defined in the Indenture) are made on the Debentures. Accordingly:
     
(i) Distributions on the Trust Securities shall be cumulative, and will accumulate whether or not there are funds of the Trust available for the payment of Distributions.
     
Distributions shall accumulate from June 12, 2007 and, except in the event (and to the extent) that the Depositor exercises its right to defer the payment of interest on the Debentures pursuant to the Indenture and the Third Supplemental Indenture, shall be payable (i) semi-annually in arrears on June 12 and December 12 of each year, commencing on December 12, 2007 until and including June 12, 2037; (ii) quarterly in arrears on March 12, June 12, September 12 and December 12 of each year, beginning on September 12, 2037 until and including June 12, 2057; and (iii) monthly thereafter in arrears on the twelfth day of each month. If any date on which a Distribution is otherwise payable on the Trust Securities on or prior to June 12, 2037 is not a Business Day, then the payment of such Distribution shall be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect
of any such delay), with the same force and effect as if made on the date on which such payment was originally payable. If any date on which a Distribution is otherwise payable on the Trust Securities after June 12, 2037 is not a Business Day, then the payment of such Distribution shall be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and shall include interest or other payment in respect of any such delay). Each date on which distributions are payable in accordance with this Section 4.1(a), a "Distribution Date".
     
(ii) In the event (and to the extent) that the Depositor exercises its right under the Indenture and the Third Supplemental Indenture to defer the payment of interest on the Debentures, Distributions on the Capital Securities shall be deferred but shall continue to accumulate. Distributions on the Trust Securities shall be payable at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest on the Debentures. The amount of Distributions payable for any period ending on or prior to June 12, 2037 shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The amount of Distributions for any period ending after June 12, 2037 shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. The amount of Distributions payable for any period shall include any Additional Amounts, if any, in respect of such period.
     
(iii) Distributions on the Trust Securities shall be made by the Paying Agent on behalf of the Property Trustee from the Payment Account and shall be payable on each Distribution Date only to the extent that the Issuer Trust has funds then on hand and available in the Payment Account for the payment of such Distributions.
     
(b) Distributions on the Trust Securities with respect to a Distribution Date shall be payable to the Holders thereof as they appear on the Securities Register for the Trust Securities at the close of business on the relevant record date for such Distribution Date, which shall be one Business Day prior to such Distribution Date; provided, however, that in the event that the Capital Securities do not remain in book-entry-only form, the relevant record date for a Distribution Date shall be the date 15 days prior to such Distribution Date. Distributions payable on any Trust Securities that are not punctually paid on any Distribution Date as a result of the Depositor having failed to make an interest payment under the Debentures will cease to be payable to the Person in whose name such Trust Securities are registered on the relevant record date, and such defaulted Distribution will instead be payable to the Person in whose name such Trust Securi ties are registered on the special record date or other specified date for determining Holders entitled to such defaulted interest established in accordance with the Indenture.
SECTION 4.2. Redemption.
     
(a) On each Debenture Redemption Date and on the stated maturity of the Debentures, the Issuer Trust will be required to redeem a Like Amount of Trust Securities at the Redemption Price.
     
(b) Notice of redemption shall be given by the Property Trustee by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date to each Holder of Trust Securities to be redeemed, at such Holder's address appearing in the Security Register. All notices of redemption shall state:
prior to the time the notice is required to be sent, the estimate of the Redemption Price together with a statement that it is an estimate and that the actual Redemption Price will be calculated on the third
Business Day prior to the Redemption Date (and if an estimate is provided, a further notice shall be sent of the actual Redemption Price on the date that such Redemption Price is calculated);
     
(v) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Trust Security to be redeemed and that Distributions thereon will cease to accumulate on and after said date, except as provided in Section 4.2(d) below; and
     
(vi) if the Capital Securities are no longer in book-entry-only form, the place or places where the Capital Securities Certificates are to be surrendered for the payment of the Redemption Price.
     
(c) The Trust Securities redeemed on each Redemption Date shall be redeemed at the Redemption Price with the proceeds from the contemporaneous redemption of Debentures. Redemptions of the Trust Securities shall be made and the Redemption Price shall be payable on each Redemption Date only to the extent that the Issuer Trust has funds then on hand and available in the Payment Account for the payment of such Redemption Price.
     
(d) If the Property Trustee gives a notice of redemption in respect of any Capital Securities, then, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Redemption Date, subject to Section 4.2(c), the Property Trustee will, with respect to Book-Entry Capital Securities, irrevocably deposit with the Clearing Agency for such Book-Entry Capital Securities, to the extent available therefor, funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price and will give such Clearing Agency irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of the Capital Securities. With respect to Capital Securities that are not Book-Entry Capital Securities, the Property Trustee, subject to Section 4.2(c), will irrevocably deposit with the Paying Agent, to the extent available therefor, funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price and will give the Paying Agent irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Hold ers of the Capital Securities upon surrender of their Capital Securities Certificates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Distributions payable on or prior to the Redemption Date for any Trust Securities called for redemption shall be payable to the Holders of such Trust Securities as they appear on the Securities Register for the Trust Securities on the relevant record dates for the related Distribution Dates. If notice of redemption shall have been given and funds deposited as required, then upon the date of such deposit, all rights of Holders holding Trust Securities so called for redemption will cease, except the right of such Holders to receive the Redemption Price and any Distribution payable in respect of the Trust Securities on or prior to the Redemption Date, but without interest, and such Trust Securities will cease to be outstanding. In the event that any date on which any Redemption Price is payable is not a Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the n ext succeeding day that is a Business Day (without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such Business Day falls in the next calendar year, such payment will be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case, with the same force and effect as if made on such date. In the event that payment of the Redemption Price in respect of any Trust Securities called for redemption is improperly withheld or refused and not paid either by the Issuer Trust or by the Depositor pursuant to the Guarantee, Distributions on such Trust Securities will continue to accumulate, as set forth in Section 4.1, from the Redemption Date originally established by the Issuer Trust for such Trust Securities to the date such Redemption Price is actually paid, in which case the actual payment date will be the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the Redemption Price.
     
(e) Subject to Section 4.3(a), if less than all the Outstanding Trust Securities are to be redeemed on a Redemption Date, then the aggregate Liquidation Amount of Trust Securities to be redeemed shall be allocated pro rata to the Common Securities and the Capital Securities based upon the relative Liquidation Amounts of such classes. The particular Capital Securities to be redeemed shall be selected on a pro rata basis based upon their respective Liquidation Amounts not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Property Trustee from the Outstanding Capital Securities not previously called for redemption, provided that so long as the Capital Securities are in book-entry-only form, such selection shall be made in accordance with the customary procedures for the Clearing Agency for the Capital Securities. The Property Trustee shall promptly notify the Securities Registrar in writing of the Capital Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Capital Securities selected for partial redemption, the Liquidation Amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Trust Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Capital Securities shall relate, in the case of any Capital Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the aggregate Liquidation Amount of Capital Securities that has been or is to be redeemed.
SECTION 4.3. Subordination of Common Securities.
     
(a) Payment of Distributions (including any Additional Amounts) on, the Redemption Price of, and the Liquidation Distribution in respect of the Trust Securities, as applicable, shall be made, subject to Section 4.2(e), pro rata among the Common Securities and the Capital Securities based on the Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities; provided, however, that if on any Distribution Date, Redemption Date or Liquidation Date any Event of Default resulting from a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, no payment of any Distribution (including any Additional Amounts) on, Redemption Price of, or Liquidation Distribution in respect of any Common Security, and no other payment on account of the redemption, liquidation or other acquisition of Common Securities, shall be made unless payment in full in cash of all accumulated and unpaid Distributions (including any Additional Amounts) on all Outstanding Capital Securities for all Distribution Periods terminating on or prior thereto, or in the case of payment of the Redemption Price the full amount of such Redemption Price on all Outstanding Capital Securities then called for redemption, or in the case of payment of the Liquidation Distribution the full amount of such Liquidation Distribution on all Outstanding Capital Securities, shall have been made or provided for, and all funds immediately available to the Property Trustee shall first be applied to the payment in full in cash of all Distributions (including any Additional Amounts) on, or the Redemption Price of, the Capital Securities then due and payable.
     
(b) In the case of the occurrence of any Event of Default resulting from any Debenture Event of Default, the Holders of the Common Securities shall have no right to act with respect to any such Event of Default under this Trust Agreement until the effect of all such Events of Default with respect to the Capital Securities have been cured, waived or otherwise eliminated. Until all such Events of Default under this Trust Agreement with respect to the Capital Securities have been so cured, waived or otherwise eliminated, the Property Trustee shall act solely on behalf of the Holders of the Capital Securities and not on behalf of the Holders of the Common Securities, and only the Holders of the Capital Securities will have the right to direct the Property Trustee to act on their behalf.

(b) For so long as any Capital Securities remain Outstanding, if, upon a Debenture Event of Default under Section 2.9(a)(i) of the Third Supplemental Indenture, the Debenture Trustee fails or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Debentures fail to declare the principal of all of the Debentures to be immediately due and payable, the Holders of at least 25% in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities then Outstanding shall have the right to make such declaration by a notice in writing to the Property Trustee, the Depositor and the Debenture Trustee.
     
At any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Debentures has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Debenture Trustee as provided in the Indenture, if the Property Trustee fails to annul any such declaration and waive such default, the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, by written notice to the Property Trustee, the Depositor and the Debenture Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
          
 
(ii) all Events of Default with respect to the Debentures, other than the non-payment of the principal of the Debentures that has become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.13 of the Indenture.
     
(iii) The Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Capital Securities, waive any past default under the Indenture, except a default in the payment of principal or interest (unless such default has been cured and a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest and principal due otherwise than by acceleration has been deposited with the Debenture Trustee) or a default in respect of a covenant or provision that under the Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each outstanding Debenture. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
     
(iv) Upon receipt by the Property Trustee of written notice declaring such an acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, by Holders of any part of the Capital Securities, a record date shall be established for determining Holders of Outstanding Capital Securities entitled to join in such notice, which record date shall be at the close of business on the day the Property Trustee receives such notice. The Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such notice, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that, unless such declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall have become effective by virtue of the requisite percentage having joined in such notice prior to the day that is 90 days after such record date, such notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall automatically and without further action by any Holder be canceled and of no further effect. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder, or a proxy of a Holder, from giving, after expiration of such 90-day period, a new written notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, as the case may be, that is identical to a written notice that has been canceled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, in which event a new record date shall be established pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.14(b) .
     
(c) For so long as any Capital Securities remain Outstanding, to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the terms of this Trust Agreement and the Indenture, upon (i) the breach by the Depositor of its obligations under Section 2.2(a)(iv) of the Third Supplemental Indenture to sell Qualifying Capital Securities (as defined therein) or Section 2.7(a) of the Third Supplemental Indenture to issue APM Qualifying Securities (as defined therein), or (ii) a Debenture Event of Default specified in Section 2.9(a) of the Third Supplemental Indenture, any Holder of Capital Securities shall have the right to institute a proceeding directly against the Depositor, pursuant to Section 2.12 of the Third Supplemental Indenture, for enforcement of payment to such Holder of any amounts payable in respect of Debentures having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities of such Holder (a "Dire ct Action"). Except as set forth in Section 5.14(b) and this Section 5.14(c), the Holders of Capital Securities shall have no right to exercise directly any right or remedy available to the holders of, or in respect of, the Debentures.
     
(d) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 5.14, the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Capital Securities, waive any past default or Event of Default and its consequences. Upon such waiver, any such default or Event of Default shall cease to exist, and any default or Event of Default arising there from shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Trust Agreement, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
SECTION 5.15. CUSIP Numbers.
     
The Administrative Trustees in issuing the Capital Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Property Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the
correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Capital Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Capital Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Administrative Trustees will promptly notify the Property Trustee of any change in the CUSIP numbers.
SECTION 6.1. Limitations on Voting Rights.
     
(a) Except as expressly provided in this Trust Agreement and in the Indenture and as otherwise required by law, no Holder of Capital Securities shall have any right to vote or in any manner otherwise control the administration, operation and management of the Issuer Trust or the obligations of the parties hereto, nor shall anything herein set forth, or contained in the terms of the Trust Securities Certificates, be construed so as to constitute the Holders from time to time as partners or members of an association.
     
(b) So long as any Debentures are held by the Property Trustee on behalf of the Issuer Trust, the Issuer Trustees shall not (i) direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Debenture Trustee, or execute any trust or power conferred on the Debenture Trustee with respect to the Debentures, (ii) waive any past default that may be waived under Section 5.13 of the Indenture, (iii) exercise any right to rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Debentures shall be due and payable, or (iv) consent to any amendment, modification or termination of the Indenture or the Debentures, where such consent shall be required, without, in each case, obtaining the prior approval of the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, provided, however, that where a consent under the Indenture would require the consent of each holder of Debentures affected thereby , no such consent shall be given by the Property Trustee without the prior written consent of each Holder of Capital Securities. The Property Trustee shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of the Capital Securities, except by a subsequent vote of the Holders of the Capital Securities. The Property Trustee shall notify all Holders of the Capital Securities of any notice of default received with respect to the Debentures. In addition to obtaining the foregoing approvals of the Holders of the Capital Securities, prior to taking any of the foregoing actions, the Issuer Trustees shall, at the expense of the Depositor, obtain an Opinion of Counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that such action shall not cause the Issuer Trust to be taxable as a corporation or classified as other than a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes.
     
(c) If any proposed amendment to the Trust Agreement provides for, or the Issuer Trustees otherwise propose to effect, (i) any action that would adversely affect in any material respect the powers, preferences or special rights of the Capital Securities, whether by way of amendment to the Trust Agreement or otherwise, or (ii) the dissolution and winding-up of the Issuer Trust, other than pursuant to the terms of this Trust Agreement, then the Holders of Outstanding Capital Securities as a class will be entitled to vote on such amendment or proposal and such amendment or proposal shall not be effective except with the approval of the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Trust Agreement, no amendment to this Trust Agreement may be made if, as a result of such amendment, it would cause the Issuer Trust to be taxable as a corporation or classified as other tha n a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes.
SECTION 6.2. Notice of Meetings.
     
Notice of all meetings of the Holders of the Capital Securities, stating the time, place and purpose of the meeting, shall be given by the Property Trustee pursuant to Section 10.8 to each Holder of Capital Securities, at such Holder's registered address, at least 15 days and not more than 90 days before the meeting.
     
At any such meeting, any business properly before the meeting may be so considered whether or not stated in the notice of the meeting. Any adjourned meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice.
SECTION 6.3. Meetings of Holders of the Capital Securities.
     
No annual meeting of Holders is required to be held. The Property Trustee, however, shall call a meeting of the Holders of the Capital Securities to vote on any matter upon the written request of the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Outstanding Capital Securities and the Administrative Trustees or the Property Trustee may, at any time in their discretion, call a meeting of the Holders of the Capital Securities to vote on any matters as to which such Holders are entitled to vote.
     
The Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of the Holders of the Capital Securities.
     
If a quorum is present at a meeting, an affirmative vote by the Holders present, in person or by proxy, holding Capital Securities representing at least a Majority in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities held by the Holders present, either in person or by proxy, at such meeting shall constitute the action of the Holders of the Capital Securities, unless this Trust Agreement requires a greater number of affirmative votes.
SECTION 6.4. Voting Rights.
     
Holders shall be entitled to one vote for each $1,000 of Liquidation Amount represented by their Outstanding Trust Securities in respect of any matter as to which such Holders are entitled to vote.
SECTION 6.5. Proxies, etc.
     
At any meeting of Holders, any Holder entitled to vote thereat may vote by proxy, provided that no proxy shall be voted at any meeting unless it shall have been placed on file with the Property Trustee, or with such other officer or agent of the Issuer Trust as the Property Trustee may direct, for verification prior to the time at which such vote shall be taken. Pursuant to a resolution of the Property Trustee, proxies may be solicited in the name of the Property Trustee or one or more officers of the Property Trustee. Only Holders of record shall be entitled to vote. When Trust Securities are held jointly by several persons, any one of them may vote at any meeting in person or by proxy in respect of such Trust Securities, but if more than one of them shall be present at such meeting in person or by proxy, and such joint owners or their proxies so present disagree as to any vote to be cast, such vote shall not be received in respect of such Trust Securities. A proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a Holder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise, and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger. No proxy shall be valid more than three years after its date of execution.
SECTION 6.6. Holder Action by Written Consent.
     
Any action that may be taken by Holders at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if Holders holding at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of all Capital Securities entitled to vote in respect of
such action (or such larger proportion thereof as shall be required by any other provision of this Trust Agreement) shall consent to the action in writing.
SECTION 6.7. Record Date for Voting and Other Purposes.
     
For the purposes of determining the Holders who are entitled to notice of and to vote at any meeting or by written consent, or to participate in any distribution on the Trust Securities in respect of which a record date is not otherwise provided for in this Trust Agreement, or for the purpose of any other action, the Administrative Trustees may from time to time fix a date, not more than 90 days prior to the date of any meeting of Holders or the payment of a Distribution or other action, as the case may be, as a record date for the determination of the identity of the Holders of record for such purposes.
SECTION 6.8. Acts of Holders.
     
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Trust Agreement to be given, made or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Property Trustee. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Trust Agreement and (subject to Section 8.1) conclusive in favor of the Issuer Trustees, if made in the manner provided in this Se ction.
     
The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority.
     
The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner that any Issuer Trustee receiving the same deems sufficient.
The ownership of Trust Securities shall be proved by the Securities Register.
     
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Trust Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Trust Security and the Holder of every Trust Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Issuer Trustees, or the Issuer Trust in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Trust Security.
     
Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Trust Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the Liquidation Amount of such Trust Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such Liquidation Amount.
     
If any dispute shall arise between the Holders and the Issuer Trustees or among the Holders or the Issuer Trustees with respect to the authenticity, validity or binding nature of any request, demand,
authorization, direction, consent, waiver or other Act of such Holder or Issuer Trustee under this Article VI, then the determination of such matter by the Property Trustee shall be conclusive with respect to such matter.
     
A Holder may institute a legal proceeding directly against the Depositor under the Guarantee to enforce its rights under the Guarantee without first instituting a legal proceeding against the Guarantee Trustee (as defined in the Guarantee), the Issuer Trust, any Issuer Trustee, or any person or entity.
SECTION 6.9. Inspection of Records.
     
Upon reasonable notice to the Administrative Trustees and the Property Trustee, the records of the Issuer Trust shall be open to inspection by Holders during normal business hours for any purpose reasonably related to such Holder's interest as a Holder.
     
The Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee, each severally on behalf of and as to itself, hereby represents and warrants for the benefit of the Depositor and the Holders that:
     
(a) the Property Trustee is a national banking association, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the United States;
     
(b) the Property Trustee has full corporate power, authority and legal right to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Trust Agreement and has taken all necessary action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by it of this Trust Agreement;
     
(e) this Trust Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee and constitutes the valid and legally binding agreement of each of the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles;
     
(f) the execution, delivery and performance of this Trust Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other action on the part of the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee and do not require any approval of stockholders of the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee and such execution, delivery and performance will not (i) violate the Charter or By-laws of the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, (ii) violate any provision of, or constitute, with or without notice or lapse of time, a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of, any Lien on any properties included in the Trust Property pursuant to the provisions of, any indenture, mortgage, credit agreement, license or other agreement or instrument to which the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee is a party or by which it is bound, or (iii) violate any law, governmental rule or regulation of the United States or
the State of Delaware, as the case may be, governing the banking, trust or general powers of the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee (as appropriate in context) or any order, judgment or decree applicable to the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee;
     
(g) neither the authorization, execution or delivery by the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee of this Trust Agreement nor the consummation of any of the transactions by the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee (as the case may be) contemplated herein requires the consent or approval of, the giving of notice to, the registration with or the taking of any other action with respect to any governmental authority or agency under any existing law of the United States or the State of Delaware governing the banking, trust or general powers of the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee (as appropriate in context); and
     
(h) there are no proceedings pending or, to the best of each of the Property Trustee's and the Delaware Trustee's knowledge, threatened against or affecting the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee in any court or before any governmental authority, agency or arbitration board or tribunal that, individually or in the aggregate, would materially and adversely affect the Issuer Trust or would question the right, power and authority of the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, to enter into or perform its obligations as one of the Trustees under this Trust Agreement.
SECTION 7.2. Representations and Warranties of Depositor.
The Depositor hereby represents and warrants for the benefit of the Holders that:
     
(a) the Trust Securities Certificates issued at the Time of Delivery on behalf of the Issuer Trust have been duly authorized and will have been duly and validly executed, issued and delivered by the Issuer Trustees pursuant to the terms and provisions of, and in accordance with the requirements of, this Trust Agreement, and the Holders will be, as of such date, entitled to the benefits of this Trust Agreement; and
     
(b) there are no taxes, fees or other governmental charges payable by the Issuer Trust (or the Issuer Trustees on behalf of the Issuer Trust) under the laws of the State of Delaware or any political subdivision thereof in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by any Issuer Trustee of this Trust Agreement.
SECTION 8.1. Certain Duties and Responsibilities.
     
(a) The duties and responsibilities of the Issuer Trustees shall be as provided by this Trust Agreement, subject to Section 10.10 hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to Section 8.1(c), no provision of this Trust Agreement shall require any of the Issuer Trustees to expend or risk its or their own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its or their duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its or their rights or powers, if it or they shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
     
Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Trust Agreement relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Issuer Trustees shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 8.1. Nothing in this Trust Agreement shall be construed to release an Administrative Trustee or the Delaware Trustee from liability for his or her own
negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or his or her own willful misconduct. To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Administrative Trustee or the Delaware Trustee has duties and liabilities relating to the Issuer Trust or to the Holders, such Administrative Trustee or the Delaware Trustee shall not be liable to the Issuer Trust or to any Holder for such Administrative Trustee's or Delaware Trustee's good faith reliance on the provisions of this Trust Agreement. The provisions of this Trust Agreement, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of the Administrative Trustees or the Delaware Trustee otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Depositor and the Holders to replace such other duties and liabilities of the Administrative Trustees or the Delaware Trustee.
     
(b) All payments made by the Property Trustee or a Paying Agent in respect of the Trust Securities shall be made only from the revenue and proceeds from the Trust Property and only to the extent that there shall be sufficient revenue or proceeds from the Trust Property to enable the Property Trustee or a Paying Agent to make payments in accordance with the terms hereof. Each Holder, by its acceptance of a Trust Security, agrees that it will look solely to the revenue and proceeds from the Trust Property to the extent legally available for distribution to it as herein provided and that the Issuer Trustees are not personally liable to such Holder for any amount distributable in respect of any Trust Security or for any other liability in respect of any Trust Security. This Section 8.1(b) does not limit the liability of the Issuer Trustees expressly set forth elsewhere in this Trust Agreement or, in the case of the Property Trustee, in the Trust Indenture Act.
     
(c) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Property Trustee shall enforce this Trust Agreement for the benefit of the Holders in accordance with Section 8.1(d) .
     
(d) The Property Trustee, before the occurrence of any Event of Default and after the curing of all Events of Default that may have occurred, shall undertake to perform only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Trust Agreement (including pursuant to Section 10.10), and no implied covenants shall be read into this Trust Agreement against the Property Trustee. If an Event of Default has occurred (that has not been cured or waived pursuant to Section 5.14), the Property Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Trust Agreement, and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise thereof, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.
     
(e) No provision of this Trust Agreement shall be construed to relieve the Property Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:
     
(i) prior to the occurrence of any Event of Default and after the curing or waiving of all such Events of Default that may have occurred:
     
(A) the duties and obligations of the Property Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Trust Agreement (including pursuant to Section 10.10), and the Property Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Trust Agreement (including pursuant to Section 10.10); and
     
(B) in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Property Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Trust Agreement; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions that by any provision hereof or of the Trust Indenture Act are specifically required to be furnished to the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Trust Agreement.
     
(iii) the Property Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by an authorized officer of the Property Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Property Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;
     
(iv) the Property Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Property Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Property Trustee under this Trust Agreement;
     
(v) the Property Trustee's sole duty with respect to the custody, safe keeping and physical preservation of the Debentures and the Payment Account shall be to deal with such Property in a similar manner as the Property Trustee deals with similar property for its own account, subject to the protections and limitations on liability afforded to the Property Trustee under this Trust Agreement and the Trust Indenture Act;
     
(vi) the Property Trustee shall not be liable for any interest on any money received by it except as it may otherwise agree with the Depositor; and money held by the Property Trustee need not be segregated from other funds held by it except in relation to the Payment Account maintained by the Property Trustee pursuant to Section 3.1 and except to the extent otherwise required by law;
     
(vii) the Property Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the Administrative Trustees or the Depositor with the respective duties under this Trust Agreement, nor shall the Property Trustee be liable for the default or misconduct of any other Issuer Trustee, the Administrative Trustees or the Depositor; and
     
(viii) Subject to Section 8.1(d), no provision of this Trust Agreement shall require the Property Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if the Property Trustee shall have reasonable grounds for believing that the repayment of such funds or liability is not reasonably assured to it under the terms of this Trust Agreement or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
     
(f) The Administrative Trustees and the Delaware Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the other Issuer Trustees or the Depositor with their respective duties under this Trust Agreement, nor shall either Administrative Trustee or the Delaware Trustee be liable for the default or misconduct of any other Issuer Trustee or the Depositor.
SECTION 8.2. Certain Notices.
     
Within ninety days after the occurrence of any Event of Default actually known to the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee shall transmit, in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 10.8, notice of such Event of Default to the Holders and the Administrative Trustees, unless such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived.
     
Within five Business Days after the receipt of notice of the Depositor's exercise of its right to defer the payment of interest on the Debentures pursuant to the Indenture, the Property Trustee shall transmit, in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 10.8, notice of such exercise to the Holders and the Administrative Trustees, unless such exercise shall have been revoked.
     
The Property Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Event of Default unless the Property Trustee shall have received written notice or a Responsible Officer of the Property Trustee charged with the administration of this Trust Agreement shall have obtained actual knowledge of such Event of Default.
SECTION 8.3. Certain Rights of Property Trustee.
Subject to the provisions of Section 8.1:
     
(a) the Property Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting in good faith upon any resolution, Opinion of Counsel, certificate, written representation of a Holder or transferee, certificate of auditors or any other certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, appraisal, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;
     
(b) if (i) in performing its duties under this Trust Agreement the Property Trustee is required to decide between alternative courses of action, (ii) in construing any of the provisions of this Trust Agreement the Property Trustee finds the same ambiguous or inconsistent with any other provisions contained herein, or (iii) the Property Trustee is unsure of the application of any provision of this Trust Agreement, then, except as to any matter as to which the Holders of the Capital Securities are entitled to vote under the terms of this Trust Agreement, the Property Trustee shall deliver a notice to the Depositor requesting the Depositor's opinion as to the course of action to be taken and the Property Trustee shall take such action, or refrain from taking such action, as the Property Trustee shall deem advisable and in the best interests of the Holders, in which event the Property Trustee shall have no liability except for its own bad f aith, negligence or willful misconduct;
     
(c) any direction or act of the Depositor contemplated by this Trust Agreement shall be sufficiently evidenced by an Officers' Certificate;
     
(d) any direction or act of an Administrative Trustee contemplated by this Trust Agreement shall be sufficiently evidenced by a certificate executed by such Administrative Trustee and setting forth such direction or act;
     
(e) the Property Trustee shall have no duty to see to any recording, filing or registration of any instrument (including any financing or continuation statement or any filing under tax or securities laws) or any rerecording, refiling or re-registration thereof;
     
(f) the Property Trustee may consult with counsel (which counsel may be counsel to the Depositor or any of its Affiliates, and may include any of its employees) and the advice of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon and in accordance with such advice; the Property Trustee shall have the right at any time to seek instructions concerning the administration of this Trust Agreement from any court of competent jurisdiction;
     
(g) the Property Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Trust Agreement at the request or direction of any of the Holders pursuant to this Trust Agreement, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Property Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities that might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction; provided that, nothing contained in this Section 8.3(g) shall be taken to relieve
the Property Trustee, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, of its obligation to exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Trust Agreement as provided in Section 8.1(d);
     
(h) the Property Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, bond, debenture, note or other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document, unless requested in writing to do so by one or more Holders, but the Property Trustee may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit;
     
(i) the Property Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through its agents or attorneys, provided that the Property Trustee shall be responsible for its own negligence or misconduct with respect to selection of any agent or attorney appointed by it hereunder;
     
(j) whenever in the administration of this Trust Agreement the Property Trustee shall deem it desirable to receive instructions with respect to enforcing any remedy or right or taking any other action hereunder, the Property Trustee (i) may request instructions from the Holders (which instructions may only be given by the Holders of the same proportion in Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities as would be entitled to direct the Property Trustee under the terms of the Trust Securities in respect of such remedy, right or action), (ii) may refrain from enforcing such remedy or right or taking such other action until such instructions are received, and (iii) shall be protected in acting in accordance with such instructions; and
     
(k) except as otherwise expressly provided by this Trust Agreement, the Property Trustee shall not be under any obligation to take any action that is discretionary under the provisions of this Trust Agreement.
     
No provision of this Trust Agreement shall be deemed to impose any duty or obligation on any Issuer Trustee to perform any act or acts or exercise any right, power, duty or obligation conferred or imposed on it, in any jurisdiction in which it shall be illegal, or in which such Person shall be unqualified or incompetent in accordance with applicable law, to perform any such act or acts, or to exercise any such right, power, duty or obligation. No permissive power or authority available to any Issuer Trustee shall be construed to be a duty.
SECTION 8.4. Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities.
     
The recitals contained herein and in the Trust Securities Certificates shall be taken as the statements of the Issuer Trust and the Depositor, and the Issuer Trustees do not assume any responsibility for their correctness. The Issuer Trustees shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Depositor of the proceeds of the Debentures.
SECTION 8.5. May Hold Securities.
     
Any Issuer Trustee or any other agent of any Issuer Trustee or the Issuer Trust, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Trust Securities and, subject to Sections 8.8 and 8.13, and except as provided in the definition of the term "Outstanding" in Article I, may otherwise deal with the Issuer Trust with the same rights it would have if it were not Issuer Trustee or such other agent.
SECTION 8.6. Compensation; Indemnity; Fees.
The Depositor agrees:
     
(a) to pay to the Issuer Trustees from time to time such reasonable compensation for all services rendered by them hereunder as may be agreed by the Depositor and the Issuer Trustees from time to time (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust);
     
(b) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the Issuer Trustees upon request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Issuer Trustees in accordance with any provision of this Trust Agreement (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of their agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to their negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct; and

Unless and until a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, at any time or times, for the purpose of meeting the legal requirements of the Trust Indenture Act or of any jurisdiction in which any part of the Trust Property may at the time be located, the Holder of Common Securities and the Administrative Trustees shall have the power to appoint one or more Persons either to act as co-trustee, jointly with the Property Trustee, of all or any part of such Trust Property, or to the extent required by law to act as separate trustee of any such property, in either case with such powers as may be provided in the instrument of appointment, and to vest in such Person or Persons in the capacity aforesaid, any property, title, right or power deemed necessary or desirable, subject to the other provisions of this Section. If a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Property Trustee shall have the so le power to appoint such a co-trustee or separate trustee, and upon the written request of the Property Trustee, the Depositor and the Administrative Trustees shall for such purpose join with the Property Trustee in the execution, delivery and performance of all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to appoint such co-trustee or separate trustee.

right, or power, any and all such instruments shall, on request, be executed, acknowledged and delivered by the Depositor.
     
Every co-trustee or separate trustee shall, to the extent permitted by law, but to such extent only, be appointed subject to the following terms, namely:

(d) No co-trustee or separate trustee hereunder shall be personally liable by reason of any act or omission of the Property Trustee or any other trustee hereunder.
 
SECTION 8.10. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.
     
No resignation or removal of any Issuer Trustee (the "Relevant Trustee") and no appointment of a successor Issuer Trustee pursuant to this Article VIII shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Issuer Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11.
     
Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, the Relevant Trustee may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Holders and by appointing a successor Relevant Trustee. The Relevant Trustee shall appoint a successor by requesting from at least three Persons meeting the eligibility requirements its expenses and charges to serve as the Relevant Trustee on a form provided by the
Administrative Trustees, and selecting the Person who agrees to the lowest expenses and charges. If the instrument of acceptance by the successor Issuer Trustee required by Section 8.11 shall not have been delivered to the Relevant Trustee within 60 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the Relevant Trustee may petition, at the expense of the, in the case of the Property Trustee, Depositor, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee.
     
The Administrative Trustees, or any of them, may be appointed, removed or replaced by Act of the Holders of Common Securities delivered to the Relevant Trustee.
     
The Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, or both of them, may be appointed, removed or replaced by Act of the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, delivered to the Relevant Trustee (in its individual capacity and, in the case of the Property Trustee, on behalf of the Issuer Trust) (i) for cause (including upon the occurrence of an Event of Default described in subparagraph (d) of the definition thereof with respect to the Relevant Trustee), or (ii) if a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at any time. Unless and until an event described in clauses (i) or (ii) of the previous sentence shall have occurred and be continuing, the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, or both of them, may be appointed, removed or replaced at any time by Act of the Holders of the Common Securities.
     
If a resigning Issuer Trustee shall fail to appoint a successor, or if an Issuer Trustee shall be removed or become incapable of acting as Issuer Trustee, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of any Issuer Trustee for any cause, the Holders of the Capital Securities, by Act of the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities then Outstanding delivered to such Relevant Trustee, may appoint a successor Relevant Trustee or Trustees, and such successor Issuer Trustee shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11. If no successor Relevant Trustee shall have been so appointed by the Holders of the Capital Securities and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 8.11, any Holder, on behalf of such Holder and all others similarly situated, or any other Issuer Trustee, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee.
     
The Property Trustee shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of an Issuer Trustee and each appointment of a successor Issuer Trustee to all Holders in the manner provided in Section 10.8 and shall give notice to the Depositor and to the Administrative Trustees. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Relevant Trustee and the address of its Corporate Trust Office if it is the Property Trustee.
     
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Trust Agreement, if any Delaware Trustee who is a natural person dies or becomes, in the opinion of the Holders of the Common Securities, incompetent or incapacitated, the vacancy created by such death, incompetence or incapacity may be filled by the Property Trustee following the procedures regarding expenses and charges set forth above (with the successor being a Person who satisfies the eligibility requirement for the Delaware Trustee set forth in Section 8.7) .
SECTION 8.11. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.
     
In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Relevant Trustee, the retiring Relevant Trustee and each successor Relevant Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities shall execute and deliver an amendment hereto wherein each successor Relevant Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (a) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Relevant Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Relevant Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities and the Issuer Trust, and (b) shall add to or change any of the
provisions of this Trust Agreement as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the Issuer Trust by more than one Relevant Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such amendment shall constitute such Relevant Trustees co- trustees and upon the execution and delivery of such amendment the resignation or removal of the retiring Relevant Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Relevant Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Relevant Trustee; but, on request of the Issuer Trust or any successor Relevant Trustee such retiring Relevant Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Relevant Trustee all Trust Property, all proceeds thereof and money held by such retiring Relevant Trustee hereunder with respect to the Trust Securities and the Trust.
     
Upon request of any such successor Relevant Trustee, the Issuer Trust shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Relevant Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in the first or second preceding paragraph, as the case may be.
     
No successor Relevant Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Relevant Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article VIII.
SECTION 8.12. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.
     
Any Person into which the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Relevant Trustee shall be a party, or any Person, succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of such Relevant Trustee, shall be the successor of such Relevant Trustee hereunder, provided that such Person shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article VIII, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto.
SECTION 8.13. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Depositor or Issuer Trust.
     
If and when the Property Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Depositor or the Issuer Trust (or any other obligor upon the Capital Securities), the Property Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Depositor or the Issuer Trust (or any such other obligor).
SECTION 8.14. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
     
In case of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other similar judicial proceeding relative to the Issuer Trust or any other obligor upon the Trust Securities or the property of the Issuer Trust or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Property Trustee (irrespective of whether any Distributions on the Trust Securities shall then be due and payable and irrespective of whether the Property Trustee shall have made any demand on the Issuer Trust for the payment of any past due Distributions) shall be entitled and empowered, to the fullest extent permitted by law, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
     
(a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of any Distributions owing and unpaid in respect of the Trust Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Property Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Property Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceeding, and
     
(b) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Property Trustee and, in the event the Property Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Property Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Property Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Property Trustee.
     
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Property Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement adjustment or compensation affecting the Trust Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Property Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.

(ii) a statement that the Property Trustee has complied with all of its obligations under this Trust Agreement during the twelve-month period (or, in the case of the initial report, the period since the Closing Date) ending with such May 15 or, if the Property Trustee has not complied in any material respect with such obligations, a description of such noncompliance; and
     
(iii) any change in the property and funds in its possession as Property Trustee since the date of its last report and any action taken by the Property Trustee in the performance of its duties hereunder which it has not previously reported and which in its opinion materially affects the Trust Securities.
     
(b) In addition, the Property Trustee shall transmit to Holders such reports concerning the Property Trustee and its actions under this Trust Agreement as may be required pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act at the times and in the manner provided pursuant thereto.
     
(c) A copy of each such report shall, at the time of such transmission to Holders, be filed by the Property Trustee with the Depositor.

     The first to occur of any of the following events is an "Early Dissolution Event":
     
(a) the occurrence of a Bankruptcy Event in respect of, or the dissolution or liquidation of, the Depositor, in its capacity as the Holder of the Common Securities, unless the Depositor shall transfer the Common Securities as provided by Section 5.10, in which case this provision shall refer instead to any such successor Holder of the Common Securities;

Promptly after the latest to occur of the foregoing, the Property Trustee will notify the Delaware Trustee in writing that the Delaware Trustee's obligations and responsibilities with respect to the Issuer Trust have terminated.
SECTION 9.4. Liquidation.
     
(a) If an Early Dissolution Event specified in clause (a), (b) or (d) of Section 9.2 occurs or upon the Expiration Date, the Issuer Trust shall be liquidated by the Property Trustee as expeditiously as the Property Trustee determines to be possible by distributing, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Issuer Trust as provided by applicable law, to each Holder a Like Amount of Debentures, subject to Section 9.4(d) .
     
Notice of liquidation shall be given by the Property Trustee by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Liquidation Date to each Holder of Trust Securities at such Holder's address appearing in the Securities Register. All such notices of liquidation shall:
longer be deemed to be Outstanding and any Trust Securities Certificates not surrendered for exchange will be deemed to represent a Like Amount of Debentures; and
  
(iv) provide such information with respect to the mechanics by which Holders may exchange Trust Securities Certificates for Debentures, or if Section 9.4(d) applies, receive a Liquidation Distribution, as the Property Trustee (after consultation with the Administrative Trustees) shall deem appropriate.
     
(b) Except where Section 9.2(c) or 9.4(d) applies, in order to effect the liquidation of the Issuer Trust and distribution of the Debentures to Holders, the Property Trustee, either itself acting as exchange agent or through the appointment of a separate exchange agent, shall establish a record date for such distribution (which shall be not more than 30 days prior to the Liquidation Date) and, establish such procedures as it shall deem appropriate to effect the distribution of Debentures in exchange for the Outstanding Trust Securities Certificates.
     
(c) Except where Section 9.2(c) or 9.4(d) applies, after the Liquidation Date, (i) the Trust Securities will no longer be deemed to be Outstanding, (ii) certificates representing a Like Amount of Debentures will be issued to Holders of Trust Securities Certificates, upon surrender of such Certificates to the exchange agent for exchange, (iii) any Trust Securities Certificates not so surrendered for exchange will be deemed to represent a Like Amount of Debentures bearing accrued and unpaid interest in an amount equal to the accumulated and unpaid Distributions on such Trust Securities Certificates until such certificates are so surrendered (and until such certificates are so surrendered, no payments of interest or principal will be made to Holders of Trust Securities Certificates with respect to such Debentures) and (iv) all rights of Holders holding Trust Securities will cease, except the right of such Holders to receive Debentures upon surr ender of Trust Securities Certificates.
     
(d) If, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 9.4, whether because of an order for dissolution entered by a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, distribution of the Debentures in the manner provided herein is determined by the Property Trustee not to be practical, or if an Early Dissolution Event specified in clause (c) of Section 9.2 occurs, the Trust Property shall be liquidated, and the Issuer Trust shall be dissolved and its affairs wound-up, by the Property Trustee in such manner as the Property Trustee determines. In such event, on the date of the dissolution, winding-up or other termination of the Issuer Trust, Holders will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Issuer Trust available for distribution to Holders, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Issuer Trust as provided by applicable law, an amount equal to the Liquidation Amount per Trust Security plus accumulated and unpaid Distr ibutions thereon to the date of payment (such amount being the "Liquidation Distribution"). If, upon any such dissolution, winding up or termination, the Liquidation Distribution can be paid only in part because the Issuer Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then, subject to the next succeeding sentence, the amounts payable by the Issuer Trust on the Trust Securities shall be paid on a pro rata basis (based upon Liquidation Amounts). The Holders of the Common Securities will be entitled to receive Liquidation Distributions upon any such dissolution, winding-up or termination pro rata (determined as aforesaid) with Holders of Capital Securities, except that, the Capital Securities shall have a priority over the Common Securities under the circumstances provided in Section 4.3.
SECTION 9.5. Mergers, Consolidations, Amalgamations or Replacements of Issuer Trust.
     
The Issuer Trust may not merge with or into, consolidate, amalgamate, or be replaced by, or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any corporation or other body, except pursuant to this Section 9.5. At the request of the Holders of the Common Securities, with the consent of the Administrative Trustees, and without the consent of the other Issuer Trustees or the Holder of the Capital Securities, the Issuer Trust may merge with or into, consolidate, amalgamate, or be replaced by or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to a trust organized as such under the laws of any state; provided, that (i) such successor entity either (a) expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Issuer Trust with respect to the Capital Securities, or (b) substitutes for the Capital Securities other securities having substantially the same terms as the Capital Securities (the  47;Successor Securities") so long as the Successor Securities have the same priority as the Capital Securities with respect to distributions and payments upon liquidation, redemption and otherwise, (ii) a trustee of such successor entity possessing the same powers and duties as the Property Trustee is
appointed to hold the Debentures, (iii) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not cause the Capital Securities (including any Successor Securities) to be downgraded by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization, (iv) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the Capital Securities (including any Successor Securities) in any material respect, (v) such successor entity has a purpose substantially identical to that of the Issuer Trust, (vi) prior to such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease, the Property Trustee has received an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that (a) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the Holders of the Capi tal Securities (including any Successor Securities) in any material respect, and (b) following such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease, neither the Issuer Trust nor such successor entity will be required to register as an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act, (vii) the Depositor or its permitted transferee owns all of the Common Securities of such successor entity and guarantees the obligations of such successor entity under the Successor Securities at least to the extent provided by the Guarantee Agreement, and (viii) the Successor Securities are listed, or any Successor Securities will be listed on notification of issuance, on any national securities exchange or other organization on which the Capital Securities are then listed, if any. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer Trust shall not, except with the consent of Holders of all of the Capital Securities, consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or be replaced by or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any other entity or permit any other entity to consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or replace it if such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease would cause the Issuer Trust or the successor entity to be taxable as a corporation or classified as other than a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes.
SECTION 10.1. Limitation of Rights of Holders.
     
Except as set forth in Section 9.2, the death or incapacity of any person having an interest, beneficial or otherwise, in Trust Securities shall not operate to terminate this Trust Agreement, nor entitle the legal representatives or heirs of such person or any Holder for such person, to claim an accounting, take any action or bring any proceeding in any court for a partition or winding up of the arrangements contemplated hereby, nor otherwise affect the rights, obligations and liabilities of the parties hereto or any of them.
SECTION 10.2. Amendment.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Trust Agreement, no Issuer Trustee shall enter into or consent to any amendment to this Trust Agreement that would cause the Issuer Trust to fail or cease to qualify for the exemption from status as an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act or to be taxable as a corporation or to be classified as other than a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes.
     
(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Trust Agreement to the contrary, without the consent of the Depositor and the Administrative Trustees, this Trust Agreement may not be amended in a manner that imposes any additional obligation on the Depositor or the Administrative Trustees.

Guarantor shall not assign its obligations hereunder, and any purported assignment other than in
accordance with this provision shall be void.
SECTION 8.2. Amendments.

Amount of the Trust Securities. The provisions of Article VI of the Trust Agreement concerning meetings

Re:

Ladies and Gentlemen:
     
We have acted as special tax counsel to BB&T Corporation, a North Carolina corporation (the "Company") and BB&T Capital Trust IV (the "Trust"), a statutory trust created under the laws of the State of Delaware, in connection with the preparation and filing of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 and each post-effective amendment thereto (as amended, the "Registration Statement"), including the prospectus, dated May 18, 2006 (the "Prospectus"), as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement dated June 5, 2007 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), with the Securities and Exchange Commission, pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, relating to (A) $600,000,000 of Capital Securities (the "Capital Securities") to be issued from time to time by the Trust, (B) $600,010,000 principal amount of junior subordinated debentures, and (C) a guarantee of payment on the Capital Securities to be issued by the Company.
     
We have examined such documents and have reviewed such questions of law, as we have considered necessary and appropriate for the purposes of our opinion set forth below. In rendering our opinions set forth below, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the genuineness of all signatures and the conformity to authentic originals of all documents submitted to us as copies.

We hereby consent to your filing this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the reference to our firm under the caption "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" contained in the Prospectus Supplement included therein.
                                                                                                    
Respectfully submitted,

Section 4.
Termination, Amendment and Waiver
. (a) The obligations of the Corporation pursuant to this Replacement Capital Covenant shall remain in full force and effect until the earliest date (the "
Termination Date
") to occur of (i) the date, if any, on which the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then-effective series of Covered Debt consent or agree in writing to the termination of this Replacement Capital Covenant and the obligations of the Corporation hereunder, (ii) the date on which neither the Corporation nor its Largest Depository Institution Subsidiary has any series of outstanding Eligible Senior Debt or Eligible Subordinated Debt (in each case without giving effect to the rating requirement in clause (b) of the definition of each such term), (iii) June 12, 2057, and (iv) the occurrence of an event of default that results in the acceleration of the Debentures. From and after the Termination Date, the obligations of the Corporation pursuant to this Replacement Capital Covenant shall be of no further force and effect.
     
(b) This Replacement Capital Covenant may be amended or supplemented from time to time by a written instrument signed by the Corporation with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then-effective series of Covered Debt, provided that this Replacement Capital Covenant may be amended or supplemented from time to time by a written instrument signed only by the Corporation (and without the consent of the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt) if (i) such amendment or supplement eliminates Common Stock, Debt Exchangeable for Common Equity, rights to acquire Common Stock, and/or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock as a Replacement Capital Security, if after the date of this Replacement Capital Covenant, an accounting standard or interpretive guidance of an existing accounting standard issued by an organization or regulator that has responsibility for establishing or interpreting accounting standards in the United States becomes effective such that there is more than an insubstantial risk that failure to eliminate Common Stock, Debt Exchangeable for Common Equity, rights to acquire Common Stock and/or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock as a Replacement Capital Security would result in a reduction in the Corporation's earnings per share as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, (ii) such amendment or supplement is not adverse to the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt and an officer of the
Corporation has delivered to the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt in the manner provided for in the indenture, fiscal agency agreement or other instrument with respect to such Covered Debt a written certificate stating that, in his or her determination, such amendment or supplement is not adverse to the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt, or (iii) the effect of such amendment or supplement is solely to impose additional restrictions on, or eliminate certain of, the types of securities qualifying as Replacement Capital Securities (other than the securities covered by clause (i) above), and an officer of the Corporation has delivered to the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt in the manner provided for in the indenture, fiscal agency agreement or other instrument with respect to such Covered Debt a written certificate to that effect.
     
(c) For purposes of Sections 4(a) and 4(b), the Holders whose consent or agreement is required to terminate, amend or supplement the obligations of the Corporation under this Replacement Capital Covenant shall be the Holders of the then-effective Covered Debt as of a record date established by the Corporation that is not more than 30 days prior to the date on which the Corporation proposes that such termination, amendment or supplement becomes effective.
Section 5.
Miscellaneous
.
     
(a) This Replacement Capital Covenant shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York
