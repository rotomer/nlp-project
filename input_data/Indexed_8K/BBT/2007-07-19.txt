These results reflect increases of 6.8% and 5.1%, respectively, compared to the same quarter last year.
     
BB&T's second quarter net income produced annualized returns on average assets and average shareholders' equity of 1.47% and 15.18%, respectively, compared to prior year returns of 1.53% and 15.34%, respectively.
     
Operating earnings for the second quarter of 2007 totaled $461 million, or $.83 per diluted share, compared to $430 million, or $.79 per diluted share, earned during the second quarter of 2006. Operating earnings exclude $3 million and $1 million in net after-tax merger-related and restructuring charges from 2007 and 2006, respectively.
     
Cash basis operating results exclude the unamortized balances of intangibles from assets and shareholders' equity and exclude the amortization of intangibles, the net amortization of purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments, merger-related and restructuring charges or credits and nonrecurring items from earnings. Cash basis operating earnings totaled $477 million for the second quarter of 2007, an increase of 6.2% compared to $449 million earned in the second quarter of 2006. Cash basis operating diluted earnings per share totaled $.86 for the second quarter of 2007, an increase of 3.6% compared to $.83 earned during the same period in 2006. Cash basis operating earnings for the second quarter of 2007 produced annualized returns on average tangible assets and average tangible shareholders' equity of 1.61% and 28.48%, respectively, compared to prior year returns of 1.67% and 27.90%, respective ly.
     
"I am pleased to report record earnings and solid overall performance for the second quarter," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John A. Allison. "We have made substantial progress on a number of key objectives for 2007. In particular, this quarter represents the third consecutive quarter we generated positive operating leverage and improved operating efficiency through a greater emphasis on controlling expenses. We also experienced strong loan and deposit growth during the quarter. While nonperforming assets and net charge-offs increased somewhat this quarter, we continue to have healthy asset quality. On balance, I am pleased with the company's momentum and we remain on track to meet our financial goals for the year."
     
For the first six months of 2007, BB&T's net income was $879 million compared to $860 million earned in the first six months of 2006.

Revenue increased across all of BB&T's fee-based businesses, including record revenues generated by BB&T's insurance operations and investment banking and brokerage operations.
     
Commissions from BB&T's insurance operations increased 7.0% to a record $229 million in the current quarter compared with $214 million earned during the second quarter last year.

Service charges on deposit accounts totaled $151 million for the second quarter of 2007, an increase of 9.4% compared to $138 million earned in the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily attributable to growth in revenues from overdraft items.
     
Other nondeposit fees and commissions totaled $127 million for the second quarter of 2007, an increase of 14.4% compared to the second quarter of 2006. This increase was generated primarily by growth in card-related services.

This press release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). BB&T's management uses these "non-GAAP" measures in their analysis of the Corporation's performance. Non-GAAP measures typically adjust GAAP performance measures to exclude the effects of charges, expenses and gains related to the consummation of mergers and acquisitions, and costs related to the integration of merged entities, as well as the amortization of intangibles and purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments in the case of "cash basis" performance measures. These non-GAAP measures may also exclude other significant gains, losses or expenses that are unusual in nature and not expected to recur. Since these items and their impact on BB&T's performance are difficult to predict, management believe s presentations of financial measures excluding the impact of these items provide useful supplemental information that is important for a proper understanding of the operating results of BB&T's core businesses. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.
     
This press release contains certain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address issues that involve significant risks, uncertainties, estimates and assumptions made by management. Actual results may differ materially from current projections. Please refer to BB&T's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a summary of important factors that may affect BB&T's forward-looking statements.
