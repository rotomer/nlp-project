BB&T reports net income of $358 million
     WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. -- BB&T Corporation (NYSE: BBT) reported today net income for the third quarter of 2008 totaling $358 million, or $.65 per diluted share, compared with $444 million, or $.80 per diluted share, earned during the third quarter of 2007. These results reflect decreases of 19.4% and 18.8%, respectively, compared to the same quarter last year.
BB&T's third quarter net income produced annualized returns on average assets and average shareholders' equity of 1.04% and 10.86%, respectively, compared to prior year returns of 1.37% and 14.24%, respectively.
    
Operating earnings for the third quarter of 2008 totaled $355 million, or $.64 per diluted share, excluding $35 million in net after-tax securities gains, $26 million in after-tax charges for other-than-temporary impairment and $6 million in after-tax charges for nonrecurring professional fees and merger-related and restructuring charges. Operating earnings for the third quarter of 2007 totaled $448 million, or $.81 per diluted share, excluding $4 million in net after-tax merger-related and restructuring charges.
    
"While we are not immune to the unprecedented challenges in the financial markets, BB&T remains a strong and financially sound company," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John A. Allison. "Our capital levels, debt ratings and earnings are among the best in the industry. Our pre-tax pre-provision operating earnings for the third quarter were $865 million, an increase of 12.0% compared to the same period last year, indicating that we are growing our client base and that our underlying businesses are performing well despite market and credit challenges. Our net interest margin improved for the fourth consecutive quarter and many of our fee income businesses continue to produce healthy revenue growth.
    
"There is tremendous turmoil in the financial services industry right now, creating a great deal of anxiety in our communities," said Allison. "BB&T has grown and prospered in other challenging economic times and I believe we will not only navigate the current challenges but will be even more successful in the future."
    
GAAP and operating results for the third quarter of 2008 include a $364 million provision for credit losses. The provision exceeded net charge-offs by $122 million and resulted in an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans and leases held for investment to 1.45% at Sept. 30 compared to 1.33% at June 30.
    
For the first nine months of 2008, BB&T's net income was $1.21 billion compared to $1.32 billion earned in the first nine months of 2007, a decrease of 8.2% . Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of 2008 totaled $2.20 compared to $2.40 earned during the same period in 2007. Excluding merger-related and restructuring charges or credits and nonrecurring items, operating earnings for the first nine months of 2008 totaled $1.13 billion, or $2.06 per diluted share, compared to $1.33 billion, or $2.42 per diluted share, earned during the first nine months of 2007.
    
Nonperforming Assets and Credit Losses Increase
BB&T's nonperforming asset levels and credit losses increased further in the third quarter of 2008 compared to the second quarter of 2008. Nonperforming assets, as a percentage of total assets, increased to 1.20% at Sept. 30, compared to .95% at June 30. Annualized net charge-offs were 1.00% of average loans and leases for the third quarter of 2008, up from .72% in the second quarter of 2008. Excluding losses incurred by BB&T's specialized lending subsidiaries, annualized net charge-offs for the current quarter were .82% of average loans and leases compared to .53% in the second quarter of 2008.
    
The provision for credit losses totaled $364 million in the third quarter of 2008, an increase of $259 million compared to the same quarter last year, and exceeded net charge-offs by $122 million in the current quarter. The increases in net charge-offs, nonperforming assets and the provision for credit losses were largely driven by continued challenges in residential real estate markets with the largest concentration of credit issues occurring in Georgia, Florida and metro Washington, D.C.
    
BB&T Capital Levels Increase
BB&T's tangible and regulatory capital levels increased and remained very healthy at Sept. 30. BB&T's tangible capital ratio was 5.8% at Sept. 30, up from 5.7% at June 30, and the Tier 1 leverage ratio was 7.6%, up from 7.2% last quarter. In addition, BB&T's Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios were 9.4% and 14.4%, respectively, up from 8.9% and 14.0%, respectively, at June 30. BB&T's risk-based capital ratios are significantly higher than an average of its peers and remain well above regulatory standards for well-capitalized banks.
    
During the third quarter, BB&T declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.47 per share, up 2.2% compared to the third quarter of 2007. BB&T has increased the cash dividend for 37 consecutive years and has paid a dividend every year since 1903.
    
Net interest margin improves to 3.66%
BB&T's fully taxable equivalent net interest income totaled $1.1 billion for the third quarter, an increase of 11.8% compared to the same quarter of 2007. The net interest margin was 3.66% for the current quarter, up from 3.65% for the second quarter of 2008 and up from 3.45% in the third quarter last year. The increase marks the fourth consecutive quarter that BB&T's margin has improved.
    
BB&T's Fee-Based Businesses Produce Solid Quarterly Growth Rates
On an operating basis, noninterest income increased $102 million, or 15.1%, during the third quarter of 2008 compared to 2007. These increases include higher revenues generated by BB&T's insurance operations, service charges on deposit accounts, and other nondeposit fees and commissions, as well as a solid performance from BB&T's mortgage banking operations.
    
Income from BB&T's insurance operations increased 12.6% to $232 million in the current quarter compared with $206 million earned during the third quarter last year. This increase was primarily the result of new product initiatives that were introduced during the second half of 2007.
    
Service charges on deposit accounts totaled $176 million for the third quarter of 2008, an increase of 12.1% compared to $157 million earned in the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily attributable to growth in client relationships and revenues from overdraft items.
    
Other nondeposit fees and commissions totaled $137 million for the third quarter of 2008, an increase of 6.2% compared to the third quarter of 2007. This increase was generated primarily by growth in bankcard income and debit card related services.
    
Revenues from mortgage banking operations totaled $83 million for the third quarter of 2008, an increase of $56 million compared to the third quarter of 2007. This increase reflects the adoption of fair value accounting standards and the net change in the mortgage servicing rights valuation. Fair value accounting increased mortgage banking income by $13 million, and also resulted in an $11 million increase in personnel expense during the quarter. The net change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights resulted in an increase of $18 million compared to the third quarter of 2007. The increase was the result of the mortgage servicing rights hedge outperforming the decline in the value of the asset. Excluding the impact of these items, mortgage banking income increased $25 million, or 119%, compared to the same period last year. The growth in mortgage banking income includes strong production revenues from both residential and commercial mortgage banking operations.
    
Other noninterest income totaled $30 million for the third quarter of 2008 compared to $23 million earned in the same quarter last year, an increase of 30.4% . The growth in noninterest income was generated by an increase of $16 million from trading and hedging activities due to losses incurred in the prior year's third quarter, which were partially offset by reduced earnings of $9 million from investments in low income housing partnerships that generate tax benefits compared to the third quarter of 2007.
    
Balance Sheet Growth Remains Healthy
Average loans and leases totaled $95.9 billion for the third quarter of 2008, reflecting an increase of $6.9 billion, or 7.7%, compared to the third quarter of 2007. This increase was composed of growth in average commercial loans and leases, which increased $5.3 billion, or 12.4%; average mortgage loans, which increased $563 million, or 3.1%; average sales finance loans, which increased $286 million, or 4.8%; average revolving credit loans, which increased $203 million, or 13.7%; average loans originated by BB&T's specialized lending subsidiaries, which increased $446 million, or 8.4%; and growth in average direct retail loans, which increased $61 million, or 0.4%, compared to the third quarter last year.
    
Average deposits totaled $90.0 billion for the third quarter of 2008, an increase of 6.9% compared to $84.2 billion for the third quarter of 2007. The average growth rate in client deposits accelerated to 16.5%, on an annualized basis, compared to the second quarter of 2008, as BB&T is gaining many new client relationships. During the third quarter of 2008, BB&T's banking network generated approximately 31,000 net new transaction accounts.
    
BB&T Continues to Expand Insurance Business
BB&T expanded its coastal South Carolina insurance operations with the acquisition of Puckett, Scheetz & Hogan of Myrtle Beach, S.C. The merger will give BB&T the largest insurance market share in greater Myrtle Beach. BB&T also acquired Sumter, S.C.-based Southern Risk Operations LLC, an insurance broker that specializes in finding coverage for a broad range of risks. Also, in early September, BB&T acquired Commercial Title Group, Inc. of Vienna, Va.
    
 
At Sept. 30, BB&T had $137.0 billion in assets and operated 1,501 banking offices in the Carolinas, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Georgia, Maryland, Tennessee, Florida, Alabama, Indiana and Washington, D.C. BB&T's common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol BBT. The closing price of BB&T's common stock on Oct. 15 was $32.16

This press release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). BB&T's management uses these "non-GAAP" measures in their analysis of the Corporation's performance. Non-GAAP measures typically adjust GAAP performance measures to exclude the effects of charges, expenses and gains related to the consummation of mergers and acquisitions, and costs related to the integration of merged entities, as well as the amortization of intangibles and purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments in the case of "cash basis" performance measures. These non-GAAP measures may also exclude other significant gains, losses or expenses that are unusual in nature and not expected to recur. Since these items and their impact on BB&T' ;s performance are difficult to predict, management believes presentations of financial measures excluding the impact of these items provide useful supplemental information that is important for a proper understanding of the operating results of BB&T's core businesses. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.
