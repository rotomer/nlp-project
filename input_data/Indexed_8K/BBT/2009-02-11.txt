ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
[ ] Written communications pursuant to Rule 425 under the Securities Act (17 CFR 230.425) [ ] Soliciting material pursuant to Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14a -12)
[ ] Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 14d-2(b) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14d -2(b))
[ ] Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 13e-4(c) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13e -4(c))
ITEM 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
     
The purpose of this Current Report on Form 8-K is to furnish the presentations made by members of BB&T's Executive Management team at its Investor and Analyst Day on February 11, 2009.
     These presentations contain certain forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of BB&T. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties and are based on the beliefs and assumptions of the management of BB&T, and the information available to management at the time that this presentation was prepared. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: (1) general economic or business conditions, either nationally or regionally, may be less favorable than expected, resulting in, among other things, a deterioration in credit quality and/or a reduced demand for credit or other services; (2) changes in the interest rate environment may reduce net interest margins and/or the volumes and values of loans made or held as well as the value of other financial assets held; (3) competiti ve pressures among depository and other financial institutions may increase significantly; (4) legislative or regulatory changes, including changes in accounting standards, may adversely affect the businesses in which BB&T is engaged; (5) local, state or federal taxing authorities may take tax positions that are adverse to BB&T; (6) adverse changes may occur in the securities markets; (7) competitors of BB&T may have greater financial resources and develop products that enable them to compete more successfully than BB&T; (8) costs or difficulties related to the integration of the businesses of BB&T and its merger partners may be greater than expected; (9) expected cost savings associated with completed mergers may not be fully realized or realized within the expected time frames; and (10) deposit attrition, customer loss or revenue loss following completed mergers may be greater than expected. The forward-looking statements included in these presentations have not been examined or compile d by the independent registered public accountants of BB&T, nor have such accountants applied any procedures thereto. Accordingly, such accountants do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on them.
     These presentations contain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). BB&T's management uses these "non-GAAP" measures in their analysis of the Corporation's performance. Non-GAAP measures typically adjust GAAP performance measures to exclude the effects of charges, expenses and gains related to the consummation of mergers and acquisitions, and costs related to the integration of merged entities, as well as the amortization of intangibles and purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments in the case of "cash basis" performance measures. These non-GAAP measures may also exclude other significant gains, losses or expenses that are unusual in nature and not expected to recur. Since these items and their impact on BB&T's performance are difficult to predict, management believes presentations of financial mea sures excluding the impact of these items provide useful supplemental information that is important for a proper understanding of the operating results of BB&T's core businesses. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included on the Investor Relations section of BB&T's website (www.bbt.com/investor) and as Exhibit 99.7.
     BB&T undertakes no responsibility to update the information presented in these presentations should facts and circumstances change.

Exhibit 99.1
A value-driven highly profitable growth
organization. During the 90's and the first part
of this decade, our growth came largely from
mergers as the economics of combinations
were compelling. Recently, our focus has
been more on organic growth.
Our over-arching purpose is to achieve our
vision and mission, consistent with our values
with the ultimate goal of maximizing
shareholder returns.
Our fundamental strategy is to deliver the best
value proposition in our markets. Recognizing
value is function of quality to price, our focus
is on creating high quality resulting in the
perfect client experience.

Values
are practical habits that enable us as
individuals to live, be successful and achieve
happiness.
For BB&T, our
Values
enable us to achieve our
mission and corporate purpose.
Values
must be consistent (non-contradictory).
Values
are important!!
7
8
Being honest is being consistent with reality
Without honesty, there can be no trust
Without trust, there can be no meaningful relationships
Honesty is fundamental to organizational and societal
advancement
We must say what we mean and keep our agreements
Integrity requires we act consistent with our values/principles
We must avoid compromising our principles for short-term
benefit
9
What is, is
Clear thinking requires first understanding the facts
Sound reasoning results in logical decisions based on the facts
All employees are challenged to use their minds to their optimum and
exercise good judgment
Each of us is responsible for what we do and who we are, and
what we think
Creativity is also strongly encouraged and only possible with
independent thought
We are challenged to think individually but work as a team
10
We are committed to be producers of wealth and well-being by
accomplishing our mission
Tangible evidence of our productivity is superior performance (results)
At the individual level, productivity is getting the job done
While individual productivity is obviously important, we must accomplish
the team's objectives in a respectful and mutually supportive manner
Individuals should be rewarded objectively based on their contributions to
our mission and adhering to our values
 
11
Positive self-esteem is the motivating sense of self-worth which we get from doing a job well
We want employees who have strong personal goals and who expect to accomplish their
goals within the context of our mission
We have a strong work ethic and we believe you receive from your work in proportion to how
much you contribute. If you don't want to work hard, work somewhere else
Effective leadership creates an environment where employees get a substantial part of their
motivational needs met by accomplishing our vision, mission, consistent with our values
Pride is the psychological reward we earn by living our values
We must perform our work such that we deserve to be proud of our
accomplishments

Primary
forces
impacting
the
industry:
46
In 10 years there will be 10 to 15 or so Financial Services firms
which will dominate the industry. There will be some mid-
sized and a number of small institutions who will face a
difficult competitive environment.
The winners will be those companies with rational strategies,
superior processes and exceptional executional abilities. Due
to these attributes, these winners will have superior revenue
and earnings per share (EPS) growth and outstanding return
on equity (ROE).

Insurance Industry Market Conditions
In 2008, excess industry capacity fueled price competition,
leading to lower renewal rates and premiums across the
board
Commercial rates have significantly declined since the 4
th
quarter of 2001 with the exception of 2005 and early 2006.
Rates were down 10  15% (varies by business class) in
2008.
In late 4Q08, prices began to stabilize in commercial
product lines.
Rates are especially turning upward for risks that historically
have been the most difficult to insure (i.e. wholesale).
