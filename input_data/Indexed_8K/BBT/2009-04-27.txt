ITEM 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
This amended current report on Form 8-K revises certain supplemental gross charge-off data related to BB&T's home equity loan portfolio as originally reported on April 17, 2009. This information was originally furnished on Exhibit 99.2 (BB&T Corporation Quarterly Performance Summary First Quarter 2009) as two supplemental tables appearing on page 16 under the heading "SUPPLEMENTAL HOME EQUITY PORTFOLIO INFORMATION".
These revisions are due to the fact that certain charge-offs were inadvertently excluded from the calculation of the gross charge-off rates in the supplemental home equity disclosures as originally reported on April 17, 2009. These revisions are limited to the supplemental home equity disclosures and had no effect on the overall reported results or consolidated charge-off ratios. The gross charge-offs ratio for home equity loans for the first quarter of 2009, on an annualized basis, was originally reported as 1.09% and should have been 1.90%. In addition, the gross charge-offs as a percentage of outstanding for home equity loans and lines by state were also revised for each of the states and in total. This total for the first quarter of 2009, on an annualized basis, was originally reported as 1.17% and should have been 1.66%. The amounts related to 2008 were not material. The revised supplemental home equity portfolio disclosures are furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
