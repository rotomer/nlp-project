This
presentation contains
certain forward-looking
statements
with respect to the
financial condition,
results of
operations
and
businesses
of BB&T. These forward-looking
statements
involve certain risks and
uncertainties
and are based on the beliefs and
assumptions
of the
management
of BB&T, and the
information available
to
management
at the time that this
presentation
was
prepared.
Factors that may cause actual results to differ
materially
from those
contemplated
by such forward-looking
statements include,
among others, the
following:
(1) general
economic
or
business conditions,
either
nationally
or
regionally,
may be less
favorable
than
expected, resulting
in, among other things, a
deterioration
in credit quality and/or a
reduced demand
for credit or other
services;
(2)
changes
in the interest rate
environment
may reduce net interest
margins
and/or the
volumes
and values of loans made or held as well as the value of other
financial
assets held; (3)
competitive pressures
among
depository
and other
financial in stitutions
may
increase significantly;
(4)
legislative
or
regulatory changes, including changes
in
accounting standards,
may
adversely
affect the
businesses
in which BB&T is
engaged;
(5) local, state or federal taxing
authorities
may take tax
positions
that are
adverse
to BB&T; (6)
adverse changes
may occur in the
securities markets;
(7)
competitors
of BB&T may have greater
financial resources
and
develop products
that enable them to
compete
more
successfully
than BB&T; (8) costs or
difficulties
related to the
integration
of the
businesses
of BB&T and its merger
partners
may be greater than
expected;
(9)
expected
cost
savings associated
with
completed mergers
may not be fully
realized
or
realized
within the
expected
time frames; and (10) deposit
attrition, customer
loss or
revenue
loss
following completed mergers
may be greater than
expected.
The forward-looking
statements included
in this
presentation
have not been < /FONT>
examined
or
compiled
by the
independent
public
accountants
of BB&T, nor have such
accountants
applied any
procedures
thereto.
Accordingly,
such
accountants
do not
express
an opinion or any other form of
assurance
on them.
This
presentation contains financial information determined
by
methods
other than in
accordance
with
accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of
America ("GAAP")
. BB&T's
management
uses these "non-GAAP"
measures
in their
analysis
of the
Corporation's performance.
Non-GAAP < /FONT>
measures typically
adjust GAAP
performance measures
to
exclude
the effects of
charges, expenses
and gains related to the
consummation
of
mergers
and
acquisitions,
and costs related to the
integration
of merged
entities,
as well as the
amortization
of
intangibles
and
purchase accounting
mark-to-market
adjustments
in the case of "cash basis"
performance measures.
These non-GAAP
measures
may also
exclude
other
significant
gains, losses or
expenses
that are
unusual
in nature and not
expected
to recur. Since these items and their impact on BB&T's
performance
are difficult to predict,
management believes presentations
of
financial measures excluding
the impact of these items provide useful
supplemental information
that is
important
for a proper
understanding
of the
operating
results of BB&T's core
businesses.
These
disclosures
should not be viewed as a
substitute
for
operating
results
determined
in
accordance
with GAAP, nor are they
necessarily comparable
to non-GAAP
performance measures
that may be
presented
by other
companies.
A
reconciliation
of these non-GAAP
measures
to the most directly
comparable
GAAP
measure
is
included
on the
Investor Relations
section of BB&T's website
(
www.bbt.
com/investor
).
     
BB&T
Corporation
does not
provide earnings guidance,
but does
discuss
trends
regarding
the factors that
influence potential
future
performance
in both its
quarterly earnings release
and its
quarterly earnings conference
call.
 
Subsequent
to the
discussion
of such
information
in any
quarterly earnings release,
BB&T
undertakes
no
responsibility
to
update
that
information
should facts and
circumstances change.
 
This
presentation repeats information
that has been
previously disclosed.
It should not be
interpreted
as
providing
new
information,
nor as
confirming
or
updating previous disclosures.

The key to
maximizing
our
probability
of being both
independent
and
prosperous
over the long term is to create a
superio r Earnings
Per Share Growth Rate without
sacrificing
the
fundamental
quality and long-term
competitiveness
of our
business,
nor taking
unreasonable
risk. Our
ultimate
goal is to
maximize shareholder returns.
