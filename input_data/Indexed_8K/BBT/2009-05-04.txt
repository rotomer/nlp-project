Indemnification
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Agent and each person, if any, who controls such Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act as follows:
(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, the Pricing Supplement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, unless such untrue statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Agent expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, the Pricing Supplement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement) or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus;
(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission (except as made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished by such Agent as aforesaid) if such settlement is effected with the prior written consent of the Company; and
(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by such Agent), as incurred, reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission (except as made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished by such Agent as aforesaid), to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above.
 
(b) Each Agent severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section 7, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, the Pricing Supplement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Agent expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, the Pricing Supplement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement) or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
(c) Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(a) hereof, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the applicable Agent(s) and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(b) hereof, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company.

No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

SECTION 8. . In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in Section 7 is for any reason held to be unavailable in accordance with its terms, the Company and the applicable Agents shall
Contribution
 
contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the Company and the applicable Agents with respect to the Securities that were the subject of the claim for indemnification in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the applicable Agents on the other. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the applicable Agents on the other shall be deemed to be in such proportion represented by the percentage that the total commissions and underwriting discounts received by the applicable Agents from such Securities bears to the total net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from such Securities, and the Company is responsible for the balance. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the applicable Agents failed to give the notice required under Section 7(c) hereof, then the Company and the applicable Agents shall contribute to such aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the applicable Agents in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such liabilities, claims, damages and expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the applicable Agents and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the applicable Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8 were determined pro rata (even if the Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation, which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 8. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, the applicable Agents shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities referred to in the second sentence of this Section 8 that were offered and sold to the public through the applicable Agents exceeds the amount of any damages that the applicable Agents have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled under this Section 8 to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person, if any, who controls the applicable Agents within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the applicable Agents, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. In addition, in connection with an offering of Securities purchased from the Company by two or more Agents as principal, the respective obligations of such Agents to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several, and not joint, in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of Securities that each such Agent has agreed to purchase from the Company.
SECTION 9. . In acting under this Agreement and in connection with the sale of any Securities by the Company (other than Securities sold to you as principal), you are acting solely as agent of the Company and do not assume any obligation towards or relationship of agency or trust with any purchaser of Securities. You will make reasonable
Status of the Agents
 
efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Securities from the Company has been solicited by you and accepted by the Company but you shall not have any liability to the Company in the event any such purchase is not consummated for any reason. If the Company shall default in its obligations to deliver Securities to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Company shall hold you harmless against any loss, claim, damage or liability arising from or as a result of such default and shall, in particular, pay to you the commission you would have received had such sale been consummated.
SECTION 10. . All representations, warranties and indemnification and contribution agreements contained in this Agreement or any Terms Agreement or other agreement to purchase Securities as principal to which you are a party, or contained in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto or thereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement or any such Terms Agreement or any such other agreement, or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Agents or any controlling person referred to in Section 7, or by or on behalf of the Company or any controlling person referred to in Section 7, and shall survive each delivery of and payment for any of the Securities.
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery
SECTION 11. . This Agreement may be terminated with respect to the participation of any party hereto for any reason at any time by such party upon the giving of thirty (30) days' advance written notice of such termination to the other parties hereto. Any Terms Agreement or other agreement to purchase securities as principal to which you are a party shall be subject to termination pursuant to the terms set forth or incorporated by reference therein, but the termination of this Agreement shall not automatically cause the termination of any such Terms Agreement or such other agreement.
Termination
In the event of any such termination of this Agreement by any other party hereto, no other party will have any liability to such party and such party will not have any liability to any other party hereto, except that (i) you shall be entitled to any commissions earned in accordance with the third paragraph of Section 2(a) hereof, (ii) if at the time of termination (A) you shall own any of the Securities with the intention of reselling them or (B) an offer to purchase any of the Securities has been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the purchaser or his agent of the Securities or Securities relating thereto has not occurred, the covenants set forth in Sections 3, 5 and 6 hereof shall remain in effect until such Securities are so resold or delivered, as the case may be and (iii) the covenant set forth in Section 3(f) hereof, the provisions of Section 4 hereof, the indemnity and contribution agreements set forth in Sections 7 and 8 hereof, and the provisions of Sections 9, 10, 13 and 14 hereof shall remain in effect.
SECTION 12. . All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and effective upon receipt and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication. Notices to any or all of the Agents shall be directed to the applicable address set forth on attached hereto. Notices to the Company shall be directed to it at BB&T Corporation, 200 West Second Street, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27101, Attention: Treasurer and Corporate Funding Manager.

SECTION 13. . The Company acknowledges and agrees that (a) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the Agent(s), on the other hand, (b) in connection with any offering of the Securities and the process leading to such transactions the Agent(s) is and has been acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company or its respective stockholders, creditors, employees or any other party, (c) the Agent(s) has not assumed and will not assume an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to any offering of the Securities contemplated in this Agreement or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether the Agent(s) has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) and the Agent(s) has no obligation to the Company with respect to any offering of the Securities contemplated in this Agreement, except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement, (d) the Agent(s) and its affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company and (e) the Agent(s) has not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to any offering of the Securities contemplated in this Agreement, and the Company has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.

SECTION 14. . This Agreement and any Terms Agreement to which you are a party shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon you (or, in the case of a Terms Agreement, the Agent or Agents which are a party thereto) and the Company and their respective successors and, to the extent provided in Section 5 hereof, shall inure to the benefit of any person who has agreed to purchase Securities from the Company pursuant to a purchase offer solicited by you. Nothing expressed or mentioned in this Agreement or any Terms Agreement to which you are a party is intended or shall be construed to give any person, firm or corporation, other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and, to the extent provided in Section 5 hereof, any person who has agreed to purchase Securities from the Company pursuant to a purchase offer solicited by you, and the controlling persons and officers and directors referred to in Sections 7 and 8 and their heirs and legal representatives, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any such Terms Agreement or any provision herein or therein contained.

References herein to the "Agents" are to the Agents as defined in that certain Distribution Agreement dated April 27, 2009, between the Company and such Agents, pursuant to which the Notes (as defined herein) may be sold, and such other persons who may from time to time act as Agents with respect to the Notes.
A. .
Establishment of Series pursuant to Section 2.01 of the Indenture
There is hereby established pursuant to Section 2.01 of the Indenture a series of Securities which shall have the following terms:
(1) The Securities of such series shall bear the title "Medium-Term Notes, Series A (Senior)" (referred to herein as the "Notes").
(2) The aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series to be issued pursuant to this Officers' Certificate is unlimited.
(3) Interest will be payable to the person in whose name a Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date (as
defined below) next preceding each Interest Payment Date (as defined below); , that interest payable at maturity or upon redemption will be payable to the person to whom principal shall be payable.
provided, however
(4) Each Note within such series shall mature on a date nine months or more from its date of issue as specified in such Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement; , that no Commercial Paper Rate Note (as defined below) shall mature less than nine months and one day from its date of issue. If the Maturity Date or Redemption Date specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement for any Note is a day that is not a Business Day, principal will be paid on the next day that is a Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such specified Maturity Date or Redemption Date, as applicable.
provided, however
With respect to the Notes of this series, "Business Day" has the following meanings, unless the applicable Pricing Supplement specifies otherwise:
 
 
 
 
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the "Principal Financial Center" of any country for the purpose of the foregoing definition is as provided in the 2006 ISDA Definitions, as amended and updated from time to time, published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.
 
"London Business Day" means any day on which dealings in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
"TARGET Business Day" means a day on which the Trans-European Automated Real Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer System is operating.
(5) Each Note within such series that bears interest will bear interest at either (a) a fixed rate (such Notes being referred to as the "Fixed Rate Notes") or (b) a floating rate determined by reference to one or more base rates, which may be adjusted by a Spread and/or Spread Multiplier (each as defined below) (such Notes being referred to as the "Floating Rate Notes"). Notes within such series may also be issued as "Zero Coupon Notes" which do not provide for any periodic payments of interest. Notes may be issued as Original Issue Discount Notes at a discount from the principal amount thereof due at the stated maturity as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Any Floating Rate Note may also have either or both of the following as set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement: (i) a maximum interest rate limitation, or ceiling, on the rate at which interest will accrue during any Interest Reset Period (a "Maximum Interest Rate"); and (ii) a minimum interest rate limitation, or floor, on the rate at which interest will accrue during any Interest Reset Period (a "Minimum Interest Rate"). The interest rate on a Note will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law as the same may be modified by United States law of general application. Under present New York law, the maximum rate of interest is (on a simple interest basis) 16% for a loan of less than $250,000, 25% for a loan of at least $250,000 but less than $2,500,000, and unlimited for a loan of $2,500,000 or more. The applicable Pricing Supplement may designate any of the following base rates ("Base Rates") as applicable to each Floating Rate Note: (a) the Commercial Paper Rate, in which case such Note will be a "Commercial Paper Rate Note"; (b) EURIBOR, in which case such Note will be a "EURIBOR Note"; (c) the Federal Funds Rate, in which case such Note will be a "Federal Funds Rate Note"; (d) LIBOR, in which case such Note will be a "LIBOR Note"; (e) the Prime Rate, in which case such Note will be a "Prime Rate Note"; (f) the CD Rate, in which case such Note will be a "CD Rate Note"; (g) the Treasury Rate, in which case such Note will be a "Treasury Rate Note"; (h) the CMT Rate, in which case such Note will be a " CMT Rate Note"; or (i) one or more other Base Rates.
The interest rate on each Floating Rate Note for each Interest Period will be determined by reference to (i) the applicable Base Rates specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement for such Interest Period, plus or minus any applicable Spread and/or multiplied by any applicable Spread Multiplier. The "Spread" is the number of basis points, each one-hundredth of a percentage point, specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement to be added or subtracted from the Base Rate for a Floating Rate Note. For example, if a Note bears interest at LIBOR plus one basis point, or .01%, and the Calculation Agent (as defined below) determines that LIBOR is 5.00% per annum, the Note will bear interest at 5.01% per annum until the next Interest Reset Date (as defined below). The "Spread Multiplier" is the percentage specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement to be applied to the Base Rate for a Floating Rate Note. For example, if a Note bears interest at 90% of LIBOR, and the Calculation Agent determines that LIBOR is 5.00% per annum, the Note will bear interest at 4.50% per annum until the next Interest Reset Date.
 
Each Note that bears interest will bear interest from and including its date of issue (or other specified date on which interest begins to accrue) or from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date on which interest on such Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) has been paid or duly provided for (i) at the fixed rate per annum applicable to the related Interest Period, or (ii) at a rate per annum determined pursuant to the Base Rates applicable to the related Interest Period or Interest Periods, in each case as specified therein and in the applicable Pricing Supplement, until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment. Interest will be payable on each Interest Payment Date and at maturity or, if applicable, upon redemption. The first payment of interest on any Note originally issued after a Regular Record Date and on or before an Interest Payment Date will be made on the Interest Payment Date following the next succeeding Regular Record Date to the registered holder on such next succeeding Regular Record Date. Interest rates and Base Rates are subject to change by the Company from time to time but no such change will affect any Note theretofore issued or which the Company has agreed to issue. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the "Interest Payment Dates" and the "Regular Record Dates" for Fixed Rate Notes shall be as described below under "Fixed Rate Notes", and the "Interest Payment Dates" and the "Regular Record Dates" for Floating Rate Notes shall be as described below under "Floating Rate Notes".
The applicable Pricing Supplement will specify, among other things: (i) the issue price, Interest Payment Dates and Regular Record Dates; (ii) with respect to any Fixed Rate Note, the interest rate; (iii) with respect to any Floating Rate Note, the Initial Interest Rate (as defined below), the method (which may vary from Interest Period to Interest Period) of calculating the interest rate applicable to each Interest Period (including, if applicable, the fixed rate per annum applicable to one or more Interest Periods), the period to maturity of any instrument on which the Base Rate for any Interest Period is predicated (the "Index Maturity"), the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, the Interest Determination Dates (as defined below), the Interest Reset Dates and any Minimum Interest Rate or Maximum Interest Rate; (iv) whether such Note is an Original Issue Discount Note; and (v) any other terms related to interest on the Notes.
Fixed Rate Notes
Each Fixed Rate Note, whether or not issued as an Original Issue Discount Note, will bear interest at the annual rate specified therein and in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Interest Payment Dates for the Fixed Rate Notes will be on February 1 and August 1 of each year and at maturity or, if applicable, upon redemption, and the Regular Record Dates for the Fixed Rate Notes will be on the day (whether or not a Business Day) 15 calendar days preceding each Interest Payment Date. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, interest payments for Fixed Rate Notes shall be the amount of interest accrued to, but excluding, the relevant Interest Payment Date. Interest on Fixed Rate Notes will be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any Interest Payment Date or any applicable Redemption Date on a Fixed Rate Note is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, and no interest will accrue for the period from and after the scheduled Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date, as the case may be.
 
Floating Rate Notes
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement and except as provided below, interest on Floating Rate Notes will be payable on the following Interest Payment Dates: in the case of Floating Rate Notes with a daily, weekly or monthly Interest Reset Date, on the third Wednesday of each month of each year; in the case of Floating Rate Notes with a quarterly Interest Reset Date, on the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December of each year; in the case of Floating Rate Notes with a semi-annual Interest Reset Date, on the third Wednesday of the two months of each year specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement; and in the case of Floating Rate Notes with an annual Interest Reset Date, on the third Wednesday of the month of each year specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Interest will also be paid at maturity or, if applicable, upon redemption. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Regular Record Dates for the Floating Rate Notes will be the day (whether or not a Business Day) 15 calendar days preceding each Interest Payment Date. In the event that any Interest Payment Date for any Floating Rate Note is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, that, for LIBOR Notes and EURIBOR Notes, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
provided
The rate of interest on each Floating Rate Note will be reset daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually (such specified period, an "Interest Reset Period", and the date on which each such reset occurs, an "Interest Reset Date"), as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Interest Reset Date will be as follows: in the case of Floating Rate Notes which are reset daily, each Business Day; in the case of Floating Rate Notes (other than Treasury Rate Notes) which are reset weekly, the Wednesday of each week; in the case of Floating Rate Notes that are Treasury Rate Notes which are reset weekly, the Tuesday of each week (except if the auction date falls on a Tuesday, then the next Business Day); in the case of Floating Rate Notes which are reset monthly, the third Wednesday of each month; in the case of Floating Rate Notes which are reset quarterly, the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December of each year; in the case of Floating Rate Notes which are reset semi-annually, the third Wednesday of the two months of each year specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement; and in the case of Floating Rate Notes which are reset annually, the third Wednesday of the month of each year specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
The interest rate in effect from the date of issue to the first Interest Reset Date with respect to a Floating Rate Note (the "Initial Interest Rate") will be as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. If any Interest Reset Date for any Floating Rate Note would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, that, for LIBOR Notes and EURIBOR Notes, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
provided
 
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the interest rate determined with respect to any Interest Determination Date will become effective on and as of the next succeeding Interest Reset Date. As used herein, "Interest Determination Date" means the date as of which the interest rate for a Floating Rate Note is to be calculated, to be effective as of the following Interest Reset Date and calculated on the related Calculation Date (as defined below). Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Interest Determination Date pertaining to any Interest Reset Date will be: for a Commercial Paper Rate Note, a CD Rate Note or a CMT Rate Note (the "Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date", the "CD Rate Interest Determination Date", and the "CMT Rate Interest Determination Date," respectively), the second Business Day prior to such Interest Reset Date; for Federal Funds Rate Notes and Prime Rate Notes (the "Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date" and the "Prime Rate Interest Determination Date", respectively), the Business Day immediately preceding the related Interest Reset Date; for EURIBOR Notes (the "EURIBOR Interest Determination Date"), the second TARGET Business Day before the Interest Reset Date; for LIBOR Notes (the "LIBOR Interest Determination Date"), the second London Business Day before the Interest Reset Date; and for a Treasury Rate Note (the "Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date") will be the Business Day (other than the Interest Reset Date) on which Treasury Bills (as defined below) would normally be auctioned in the week in which such Interest Reset Date falls. Treasury Bills are usually sold at auction on Monday of each week, unless that day is a legal holiday, in which case the auction is usually held on the following Tuesday, although it may be held on the preceding Friday. If, as the result of a legal holiday, an auction is so held on the preceding Friday, such Friday will be the Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date pertaining to the Interest Reset Date occurring in the next succeeding week. If an auction date shall fall on any Interest Reset Date for a Treasury Rate Note, then such Interest Reset Date shall instead be the first Business Day immediately following such auction date. The Interest Determination Date pertaining to a Floating Rate Note the interest rate of which is determined by reference to two or more Base Rates will be the latest Business Day which is at least two Business Days prior to such Interest Reset Date for such Floating Rate Note on which each such Base Rate is determinable.
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, interest payments on an Interest Payment Date for a Floating Rate Note will include interest accrued from, and including, the most recent Interest Payment Date on which interest has been paid or duly provided for (or, from, and including, the date of issue, or any date specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as the date on which interest begins to accrue, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for with respect to such Floating Rate Note). Interest will accrue to, but excluding, the next Interest Payment Date (each such interest accrual period, an "Interest Period"), or if earlier the date on which the principal is paid or duly made available for payment. Accrued interest from the date of issue, from such other specified date on which interest begins to accrue or from the last date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for to the date for which interest is being calculated shall be calculated by multiplying the face amount of a Floating Rate Note by the applicable accrued interest factor (the "Accrued Interest Factor"). The Accrued Interest Factor shall be computed by adding together the interest factors calculated for each day in the relevant Interest Period. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the interest factor for each such day shall be computed by dividing the per annum interest rate, expressed as a decimal, applicable to such day by 360 in the case of Commercial
 
Paper Rate Notes, Federal Funds Rate Notes, LIBOR Notes, EURIBOR Notes, Prime Rate Notes, and CD Rate Notes, or by the actual number of days in the year in the case of Treasury Rate Notes and CMT Rate Notes. The interest rate in effect on each day will be (i) if such day is an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with respect to the Interest Determination Date pertaining to such Interest Reset Date or (ii) if such day is not an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with respect to the Interest Determination Date relating to the next preceding Interest Reset Date, subject in either case to any Maximum Interest Rate or Minimum Interest Rate referred to above or in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, U.S. Bank National Association will be the "Calculation Agent". On or before each Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the interest rate in accordance with the foregoing and as described below with respect to the applicable Base Rate and notify the Company and the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will determine the Accrued Interest Factor applicable to any such Floating Rate Note. The Paying Agent will, upon the request of the holder of any Floating Rate Note, provide the interest rate then in effect and the interest rate which will become effective as a result of a determination made with respect to the most recent Interest Determination Date with respect to such Floating Rate Note. The determinations of interest rates made by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding, and neither the Trustee nor the Paying Agent shall have the duty to verify determinations of interest rates made by the Calculation Agent. The determinations of Accrued Interest Factors made by the Paying Agent shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the "Calculation Date", if applicable, pertaining to any Interest Determination Date on a Floating Rate Note will be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day after such Interest Determination Date, or, if any such day is not a Business Day, the following Business Day, and (ii) the Business Day before the applicable Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Maturity Date, as the case may be.
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, all percentages resulting from any calculation on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of one percentage point, with five one-millionths of one percentage point rounded upward (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) will be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655) and 9.876544% (or .09876544) will be rounded to 9.87654% (or .0987654)); all calculations of the Accrued Interest Factor for any day on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-millionth, with five one-billionths rounded upward (e.g. .098765455 will be rounded to .09876546 and .098765454 will be rounded to .09876545); and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculations on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward).
. If the Base Rate specified with respect to any Interest Period for a Floating Rate Note is the Commercial Paper Rate, such Floating Rate Note shall be a "Commercial Paper Rate Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to such Floating Rate Note for any Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period shall be the Commercial Paper Rate as adjusted by the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified in the Commercial Paper Rate Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
Commercial Paper Rate
 
Commercial Paper Rate Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any.
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, "Commercial Paper Rate" means, with respect to any Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date, the Money Market Yield (calculated as described below) of the rate on that date for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as published in "Statistical Release H.15(519), Selected Interest Rates" or any successor publication of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("H.15 (519)") under the heading "Commercial Paper  Nonfinancial."
Unless the applicable Pricing Supplement specifies otherwise, the following procedures will be followed if the Commercial Paper Rate cannot be determined as described above: (I) If the rate is not published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date relating to the Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date, then the Commercial Paper Rate will be the Money Market Yield of the rate on the Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as set forth in the daily update of H.15(519), available through the worldwide website of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/update, or any successor site or publication (the "H.15 Daily Update") under the heading "Commercial Paper  Nonfinancial;" (II) If by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date the rate is not published in either H.15(519) or the H.15 Daily Update, then the Calculation Agent shall determine the Commercial Paper Rate to be the Money Market Yield of the arithmetic mean of the offered rates as of 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date, of three leading dealers of commercial paper in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent, after consultation with the Company, for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement placed for an industrial issuer whose bond rating is "AA," or the equivalent, from a nationally recognized statistical rating agency; , that if the dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as described above in this sentence, the Commercial Paper Rate in effect immediately before the Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date will not change and will remain the Commercial Paper Rate in effect on such Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date.
provided, however
"Money Market Yield" shall be a yield calculated in accordance with the following formula:
 
where "D" refers to the applicable per annum rate for commercial paper, quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal, and "M" refers to the actual number of days in the Interest Period for which the interest is being calculated.
. If the Base Rate specified with respect to any Interest Period for a Floating Rate Note is the Federal Funds Rate, such Floating Rate Note shall be a "Federal
Federal Funds Rate
 
Funds Rate Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to such Floating Rate Note for any Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period shall be the Federal Funds Rate as adjusted by the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified in the Federal Funds Rate Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Federal Funds Rate Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any. The Federal Funds Rate will be calculated by reference to either the Federal Funds (Effective) Rate, the Federal Funds Open Rate or the Federal Funds Target Rate, as specified in the Federal Funds Rate Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, "Federal Funds Rate" means the rate determined by the Calculation Agent, with respect to any Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date, in accordance with the following provisions:
(I) If "Federal Funds (Effective) Rate" is the specified Federal Funds Rate in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Federal Funds Rate as of the applicable Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate with respect to such date for United States dollar federal funds as published in H.15(519) opposite the caption "Federal Funds (Effective)," as such rate is displayed on Reuters on page FEDFUNDS1 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page FEDFUNDS1") under the heading "EFFECT," or, if such rate is not so published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the rate with respect to such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date for United States dollar federal funds as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "Federal funds (effective)." If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page FEDFUNDS1 or is not yet published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Federal Funds Rate with respect to such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight United States dollar federal funds arranged by three leading brokers of U.S. dollar federal funds transactions in New York City (which may include the Agents or their affiliates) selected by the Calculation Agent, prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date; , that if the brokers so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Federal Funds Rate determined as of such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date will be the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date.
provided, however
(II) If "Federal Funds Open Rate" is the specified Federal Funds Rate in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Federal Funds Rate as of the applicable Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate on such date under the heading "Federal Funds" for the relevant Index Maturity and opposite the caption "Open" as such rate is displayed on Reuters on page 5 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page 5"), or, if such rate does not appear on Reuters Page 5 by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the Federal Funds Rate for the Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date will be the rate for that day displayed on FFPREBON Index page on Bloomberg L.P. ("Bloomberg"), which is the Fed Funds Opening Rate as reported by Prebon Yamane (or a successor) on Bloomberg. If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page 5 or is not displayed on
 
FFPREBON Index page on Bloomberg or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Federal Funds Rate on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight United States dollar federal funds arranged by three leading brokers of United States dollar federal funds transactions in New York City (which may include the Agents or their affiliates) selected by the Calculation Agent prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date; , that if the brokers so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Federal Funds Rate determined as of such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date will be the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date.
provided, however
(III) If "Federal Funds Target Rate" is the specified Federal Funds Rate in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Federal Funds Rate as of the applicable Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate on such date as displayed on the FDTR Index page on Bloomberg. If such rate does not appear on the FDTR Index page on Bloomberg by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the Federal Funds Rate for such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date will be the rate for that day appearing on Reuters Page USFFTARGET= (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page USFFTARGET="). If such rate does not appear on the FDTR Index page on Bloomberg or is not displayed on Reuters Page USFFTARGET= by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Federal Funds Rate on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight United States dollar federal funds arranged by three leading brokers of United States dollar federal funds transactions in New York City (which may include the Agents or their affiliates) selected by the Calculation Agent prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date.
. If the Base Rate specified with respect to any Interest Period for a Floating Rate Note is LIBOR, such Floating Rate Note shall be a "LIBOR Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to such Floating Rate Note for any Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period shall be LIBOR as adjusted by the Spread and/or the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified in the LIBOR Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement. LIBOR Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any.
LIBOR
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, LIBOR will be determined by the Calculation Agent for each LIBOR Interest Determination Date in accordance with the following provisions:
(I) With respect to a LIBOR Interest Determination Date, LIBOR will be the rate for deposits in the Designated LIBOR Currency having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as such rate is displayed on Reuters on page LIBOR01 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service for the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks for the Designated LIBOR Currency) ("Reuters Page LIBOR01") as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date. If no such rate so
 
appears, LIBOR on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be determined in accordance with the provisions described in clause (II) below.
(II) With respect to a LIBOR Interest Determination Date on which no rate is displayed on Reuters Page LIBOR01 as specified in clause (I) above, the Calculation Agent shall request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks (which may include affiliates of the Agents) in the London interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in the Designated LIBOR Currency for the period of the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, commencing on the related Interest Reset Date, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in the Designated LIBOR Currency in such market at such time. If at least two such quotations are so provided, then LIBOR on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean calculated by the Calculation Agent of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, then LIBOR on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean calculated by the Calculation Agent of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., in the applicable Principal Financial Center (as defined below), on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date by three major banks (which may include affiliates of the Agents) in such Principal Financial Center selected by the Calculation Agent for loans in the Designated LIBOR Currency to leading European banks, having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in the Designated LIBOR Currency in such market at such time; , that if the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, LIBOR determined as of such LIBOR Interest Determination Date shall be LIBOR in effect on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date.
provided, however
As referenced above, "Designated LIBOR Currency" means the currency specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as to which LIBOR shall be calculated or, if no such Designated LIBOR Currency is specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, U.S. dollars. As used in the above provisions regarding determining LIBOR, "Principal Financial Center" means (i) the capital city of the country issuing the specified currency or (ii) the capital city of the country to which the Designated LIBOR Currency, if applicable, relates, except, in each case, that with respect to United States dollars, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, euro, New Zealand dollars, South African rand and Swiss francs, the "Principal Financial Center" shall be New York City, Sydney, Toronto, London (solely in the case of the Designated LIBOR Currency), Wellington, Johannesburg and Zurich, respectively.
. If the Base Rate specified with respect to any Interest Period for a Floating Rate Note is EURIBOR, such Floating Rate Note shall be a "EURIBOR Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to such Floating Rate Note for any Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period shall be the EURIBOR Rate as adjusted by the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified in the EURIBOR Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement. EURIBOR Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any.
EURIBOR Rate
 
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, EURIBOR means with respect to any EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, a base rate equal to the interest rate for deposits in euro designated as "EURIBOR" and sponsored jointly by the European Banking Federation and ACI  the Financial Market Association, or any company established by the joint sponsors for purposes of compiling and publishing that rate. EURIBOR will be determined in the following manner:
(I) EURIBOR will be the offered rate for deposits in euro having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, beginning on the second euro Business Day after such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, as that rate appears on Reuters Page EURIBOR 01 as of 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date.
(II) If the rate described above does not appear on Reuters Page EURIBOR 01, EURIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates, at approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, at which deposits of the following kind are offered to prime banks in the euro-zone interbank market by the principal euro-zone office of each of four major banks in that market selected by the Calculation Agent: euro deposits having such EURIBOR Index Maturity, beginning on such EURIBOR Interest Reset Date, and in a representative amount. The Calculation Agent will request that the principal euro-zone office of each of these banks provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two quotations are provided, EURIBOR for such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations.
(III) If fewer than two quotations are provided as described above, EURIBOR for such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for loans of the following kind to leading euro-zone banks quoted, at approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time on that EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, by three major banks in the euro-zone selected by the Calculation Agent: loans of euro having such EURIBOR Index Maturity, beginning on such EURIBOR Interest Reset Date, and in an amount that is representative of a single transaction in euro in that market at the time.
(IV) If fewer than three banks selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as described above, EURIBOR for the new Interest Period will be EURIBOR in effect for the prior Interest Period. If the initial Base Rate has been in effect for the prior Interest Period, however, it will remain in effect for the new Interest Period.
. If the Base Rate specified with respect to any Interest Period for a Floating Rate Note is the Prime Rate, such Floating Rate Note shall be a "Prime Rate Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to such Floating Rate Note for any Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period shall be the Prime Rate as adjusted by the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified in the Prime Rate Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Prime Rate Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any.
Prime Rate
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, "Prime Rate" means, with respect to any Prime Rate Interest Determination Date, the rate on such date as such rate is published in H.15(519) under the caption "Bank prime loan" or, if not published by 3:00
 
p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, the rate on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "Bank prime loan." If such rate is not yet published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update, or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Prime Rate shall be the arithmetic mean calculated by the Calculation Agent of the rates of interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on Reuters on page USPRIME1 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major United States banks) ("Reuters Page USPRIME1") as such bank's prime rate or base lending rate as of 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date. If fewer than four such rates so appear on the Reuters Page USPRIME1 for such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Prime Rate shall be the arithmetic mean calculated by the Calculation Agent of the prime rates or base lending rates quoted on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by a 360-day year as of the close of business on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date by three major banks (which may include affiliates of the Agents) in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent; , that if the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Prime Rate determined as of such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date will be the Prime Rate in effect on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date.
provided, however
"Reuters Page USPRIME1" means the display on the Reuters 3000 Xtra Service (or any successor service) on the "USPRIME1 Page" (or such other page as may replace the USPRIME1 Page on such service) for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major U.S. banks.
. If the Base Rate specified with respect to any Interest Period for a Floating Rate Note is the CD Rate, such Floating Rate Note shall be a "CD Rate Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to such Floating Rate Note for any Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period shall be the CD Rate as adjusted by the Spread and/or the Spread Multiplier, specified in the CD Rate Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement. CD Rate Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any.
CD Rate
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, "CD Rate" means, with respect to any CD Rate Interest Determination Date, the rate on that date for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as published in H.15(519), under the heading "CDs (Secondary Market)." If the CD Rate cannot be determined in this manner, the following procedures will apply:
(I) If the rate described above is not published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the relevant Calculation Date, then the CD Rate will be the rate on that CD Rate Interest Determination Date for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit having the specified Index Maturity as published in H.15 Daily Update, or other recognized electronic sources used for the purpose of displaying the applicable rate, under the caption "CDs (Secondary Market)."
 
(II) If by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the applicable Calculation Date, that rate is not published in either H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source, the CD Rate for that CD Rate Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on that CD Rate Interest Determination Date, of three leading non-bank dealers in negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit in New York City, which may include one or more of the Agents or their affiliates, selected by the Calculation Agent, after consultation with the Company, for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit of major U.S. money market banks for negotiable certificates of deposit with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time.
(III) If the dealer(s) selected as described above by the Calculation Agent are not quoting rates as set forth above, the CD Rate for that CD interest rate determination date will be the CD Rate in effect for the immediately preceding interest reset period, or if there was no interest reset period, then the rate of interest payable will be the Initial Interest Rate.
. If the Base Rate specified with respect to any Interest Period for a Floating Rate Note is the Treasury Rate, such Floating Rate Note shall be a "Treasury Rate Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to such Floating Rate Note for any Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period shall be the Treasury Rate as adjusted by the Spread and/or the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified in the Treasury Rate Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Treasury Rate Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any.
Treasury Rate
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date, the rate from the auction held on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date (the "Auction") of direct obligations of the United States ("Treasury Bills") having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement under the caption "INVEST RATE" on the display on Reuters page USAUCTION10 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) or page USAUCTION11 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) or, if not so published at 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, the Bond Equivalent Yield (as defined below) of the rate for such Treasury Bills as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Bills/Auction High." If such rate is not so published in the related H.15 Daily Update or another recognized source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, the Treasury Rate on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the Auction rate of such Treasury Bills as announced by the United States Department of the Treasury. In the event that such Auction rate is not so announced by the United States Department of the Treasury on such Calculation Date, or if no such Auction is held, then the Treasury Rate on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the rate on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date of Treasury Bills having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as published in H.15(519) under the caption "U.S. government
 
securities/treasury bills/secondary market" or, if not yet published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, the rate on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date of such Treasury Bills as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "U.S. government securities/treasury bills (secondary market)." If such rate is not yet published in the H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Treasury Rate on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid rates, as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date, of the three leading primary United States government securities dealers (which may include the Agents or their affiliates) selected by the Calculation Agent, for the issue of Treasury Bills with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement; , that if the dealers so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Treasury Rate determined as of such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date will be the Treasury Rate in effect on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date.
provided, however
The "Bond Equivalent Yield" means a yield (expressed as a percentage) calculated in accordance with the following formula:
 
where "D" refers to the applicable per annum rate for Treasury Bills quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal, "N" refers to 365 or 366, as the case may be, and "M" refers to the actual number of days in the applicable Interest Reset Period.
. If the Base Rate specified with respect to any Interest Period for a Floating Rate Note is the CMT Rate, such Floating Rate Note is a "CMT Rate Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to such Floating Rate Note for any Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period shall be the CMT Rate as adjusted by the Spread and/or the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified in the CMT Rate Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement. CMT Rate Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any.
CMT Rate
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, "CMT Rate" means, with respect to any CMT Rate Interest Determination Date:
(I) If "Reuters Page FRBCMT" is the specified CMT Reuters Page in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the CMT Rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as set forth in H.15(519) under the caption "Treasury constant maturities," as such yield is displayed on Reuters (or any successor service) on page FRBCMT (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page FRBCMT") for such CMT Rate Interest Determination
 
Date. If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page FRBCMT, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement and for such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date as set forth in H.15(519) under the caption "Treasury constant maturities." If such rate does not appear in H.15(519), the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate for the period of the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as may then be published by either the Federal Reserve Board or the United States Department of the Treasury that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to the rate that would otherwise have been published in H.15(519). If the Federal Reserve Board or the United States Department of the Treasury does not publish a yield on United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement for such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices at approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three leading primary United States government securities dealers in New York City (which may include the Agents or their affiliates) (each, a "Reference Dealer") selected by the Calculation Agent from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity equal to the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, a remaining term to maturity no more than one year shorter than such Index Maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time. If fewer than three prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, a remaining term to maturity closest to such Index Maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time. If two such United States Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement have remaining terms to maturity equally close to such Index Maturity, the quotes for the treasury security with the shorter original term to maturity will be used. If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor the lowest of such quotations shall be eliminated; provided, however, that if fewer than three such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate determined as of such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the CMT Rate in effect on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date.
 
(II) If "Reuters Page FEDCMT" is the specified CMT Reuters Page in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the CMT Rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the one-week or one-month, as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, average yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as set forth in H.15(519) opposite the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," as such yield is displayed on Reuters on page FEDCMT (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page FEDCMT") for the week or month, as applicable, ended immediately preceding the week or month, as applicable, in which such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date falls. If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page FEDCMT, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the one-week or one-month, as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, average yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement for the week or month, as applicable, preceding such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date as set forth in H.15(519) opposite the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities." If such rate does not appear in H.15(519), the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the one-week or one-month, as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, average yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as otherwise announced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the week or month, as applicable, ended immediately preceding the week or month, as applicable, in which such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date falls. If the Federal Reserve Bank of New York does not publish a one-week or one-month, as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, average yield on United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement for the applicable week or month, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices at approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity equal to the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, a remaining term to maturity of no more than one year shorter than such Index Maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time. If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date calculated by the Calculation Agent based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor the lowest of such quotation shall be eliminated. If fewer than three prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity longer than the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing
 
Supplement, a remaining term to maturity closest to such Index Maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time. If two United States Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement have remaining terms to maturity equally close to such Index Maturity, the quotes for the Treasury security with the shorter original term to maturity will be used. If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date calculated by the Calculation Agent based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor lowest of such quotations shall be eliminated; , that if fewer than three such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate determined as of such CMT Rate determination date shall be the CMT Rate in effect on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date.
provided, however
Zero Coupon Notes
The specific terms of any Zero Coupon Notes will be set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
(6) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, principal of (and premium, if any) and interest (if any) on the Notes will be payable, and, except as described in the Prospectus Supplement, dated April 27, 2009, relating to the issuance of the Notes, and the Administrative Procedures attached hereto as Exhibit F with respect to any Global Security (as defined below) representing Book-Entry Notes (as defined below), the transfer of the Notes will be registrable and Notes will be exchangeable for Notes bearing identical terms and provisions at the corporate trust office of U.S. Bank National Association (the "Paying Agent," unless another Paying Agent is specified in an applicable Pricing Supplement), in New York, New York, provided that payments of principal and any premium and interest with respect to any Registered Note may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the address of the person or entity entitled thereto as it appears on the security register of the Company, except that holders of $10,000,000 or more in aggregate principal amount of similar Notes shall be entitled to receive payments by wire transfer of immediately available funds, if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been given to the Trustee or Paying Agent in writing not later than ten Business Days prior to the applicable Interest Payment Date. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, U.S. Bank National Association will be the "Security Registrar" with respect to the Notes. The Paying Agent or Security Registrar may be terminated or resign from its role as such with respect to the Notes as long as another agent is in place to serve in such role.
(7) If so specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Company on the date or dates prior to maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement at the price or prices specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Unless otherwise specified in such Pricing Supplement, in the case of Notes other than Zero Coupon Notes or certain interest bearing notes issued as Original Issue Discount Notes, the redemption price will be expressed as a specified percentage of the principal amount of such Note, together with accrued interest, if any, to the date of redemption stated in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement,
 
in the case of Zero Coupon Notes or certain interest bearing Notes issued as Original Issue Discount Notes (as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement), the redemption price will be a specified percentage of the Amortized Face Amount (as defined below) of such Note (as described in paragraph (13) below), together with accrued interest, if any, to the date of redemption (or, in the case of any interest bearing Note issued as an Original Issue Discount Note, any accrued but unpaid "qualified stated interest" payments (as specified in Paragraph (13) below). Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Company may redeem any of the Notes which are redeemable and remain outstanding either in whole or from time to time in part upon the terms and conditions set forth in Article Ten of the Indenture.
(8) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Company shall not be obligated to redeem or purchase any Notes of such series pursuant to any sinking fund or analogous provisions or at the option of any Holder.
(9) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Notes may be issued only in fully registered form. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the authorized denomination of the Notes of such series other than Foreign Currency Notes (as defined below), shall be $1,000 or any amount in excess of $1,000 which is an integral multiple of $1,000. Foreign Currency Notes will be issued in the denominations specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
(10) The Notes may be denominated, and payments of principal of and interest on the Notes will be made, in United States dollars or in such foreign currencies or foreign currency units as may be specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement (each such specified foreign currency, a "Specified Currency"). In the case of a Note having a Specified Currency (a "Foreign Currency Note"), the Company will (unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement) arrange to convert all payments in respect of such Foreign Currency Note into U.S. dollars. The amount of any U.S. dollar payment in respect of a Foreign Currency Note will be based on the bid quoted by the exchange rate agent for the purchase of U.S. dollars with the Specified Currency for settlement on the payment date and on the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to all Holders of the Foreign Currency Notes who are scheduled to receive such payments. The bid quotation will be as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on the second day preceding the applicable payment date on which banks are open for business in London and New York City. If this bid quotation is not available, such exchange rate agent will obtain a bid quotation from a leading foreign exchange bank in London or New York City selected by such exchange rate agent for this purchase. If these bids are not available, payment of the aggregate amount due to all Holders of Foreign Currency Notes on the payment date will be made in the Specified Currency. All currency exchange costs will be borne by the Holder of the Note by deductions from such payments due such Holder. If so indicated in a Foreign Currency Note and the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Holder thereof may elect to receive all payments in respect of such Note in the Specified Currency by delivery of a written notice to the applicable Paying Agent not later than 15 calendar days prior to the applicable payment date, and such election shall remain in effect until revoked by written notice to such Paying Agent received not later than 15 calendar days prior to the applicable payment date.
 
(11) Except as otherwise described in Paragraph (5) above and Paragraph (13) below, the amount of payments of principal of and any premium or interest on the Notes will not be determined with reference to an index.
(12) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Events of Default with respect to the Notes are those specified in Section 4.01 of the Indenture.
(13) The portion of the principal amount of the Notes, other than Original Issue Discount Notes (including any Zero Coupon Notes), which shall be payable upon declaration of acceleration of maturity thereof shall not be other than the principal amount thereof. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the portion of the principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes and certain interest bearing Notes issued as Original Issue Discount Notes (as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement) upon any acceleration of the maturity thereof will be the Amortized Face Amount and in the case of an interest-bearing note issued as an Original Issue Discount Note, any accrued but unpaid qualified stated interest payments. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the amount payable to the holder of such Original Issue Discount Note upon any redemption thereof will be the applicable specified percentage of the Amortized Face Amount thereof specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, and in the case of any interest bearing Note issued as an Original Issue Discount Note, any accrued but unpaid "qualified stated interest" payments (as defined in the Treasury Regulations regarding original issue discount issued by the Treasury Department (the "Regulations")). The "Amortized Face Amount" of an Original Issue Discount Note is equal to the sum of (i) the Issue Price (as defined below) of such Original Issue Discount Note and (ii) that portion of the difference between the Issue Price and the principal amount of such original Issue Discount Note that has been amortized at the Stated Yield (as defined below) of such Original Issue Discount Note (computed in accordance with Section 1272(a)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and Section 1.1275-1(b) of the Regulations, in each case as in effect on the issue date of such Original Issue Discount Note) at the date as of which the Amortized Face Amount is calculated. In no event can the Amortized Face Amount exceed the principal amount of such Note due at the stated maturity thereof. As used in the preceding sentence, the term "Issue Price" means the principal amount of such Original Issue Discount Note due at the stated maturity thereof less the "Original Issue Discount" of such Original Issue Discount Note specified on the face thereof and in the applicable Pricing Supplement. The term "Stated Yield" of such Original Issue Discount Note means the "Yield to Maturity" specified on the face of such Original Issue Discount Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement for the period from the Original Issue Date of such Original Issue Discount Note, as specified on the face of such Original Issue Discount Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement, to the stated maturity thereof based on its Issue Price and stated redemption price at maturity thereof.
(14) Each Note will be represented by either a master global note or a global note in fully registered form (each a "Global Note") registered in the name of a nominee of the Depositary (each such Note represented by a Global Note being herein referred to as a "Book-Entry Note") or a certificate issued in definitive registered form, without coupons (a "Certificated Note"), as set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, The Depository Trust Company will act as Depositary. Except as provided in Section 2.06 of the Indenture or in the applicable Note, Book-
 
Entry Notes will not be issuable in certificated form and will not be exchangeable or transferable. So long as the Depositary or its nominee is the registered holder of any Global Note, the Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole Holder of the Book-Entry Note or Notes represented by such Global Note for all purposes under the Indenture and the Notes.
(15) Subject to the terms of the Indenture and the resolutions and authorization referred to in the first paragraph hereof, each Note shall have such other terms (which may be in addition to or different from the terms set forth herein and which may differ from the terms of other Notes) as are specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.

Any Floating Rate Note may also have either or both of the following as set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement: (i) a maximum interest rate limitation, or ceiling, on the rate at which interest will accrue during any Interest Reset Period (a "Maximum Interest Rate"); and (ii) a minimum interest rate limitation, or floor, on the rate at which interest will accrue during any Interest Reset Period (a "Minimum Interest Rate"). The interest rate on a Note will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law as the same may be modified by United States law of general application. Under present New York law, the maximum rate of interest is (on a simple interest basis) 16% for a loan of less than $250,000, 25% for a loan of at least $250,000 but less than $2,500,000, and unlimited for a loan of $2,500,000 or more. The applicable Pricing Supplement may designate any of the following base rates ("Base Rates") as applicable to each Floating Rate Note: (a) the Commercial Paper Rate, in which case such Note will be a "Commercial Paper Rate Note"; (b) EURIBOR, in which case such Note will be a "EURIBOR Note"; (c) the Federal Funds Rate, in which case such Note will be a "Federal Funds Rate Note"; (d) LIBOR, in which case such Note will be a "LIBOR Note"; (e) the Prime Rate, in which case such Note will be a "Prime Rate Note"; (f) the CD Rate, in which case such Note will be a "CD Rate Note"; (g) the Treasury Rate, in which case such Note will be a "Treasury Rate Note"; (h) the CMT Rate, in which case such Note will be a " CMT Rate Note"; or (i) one or more other Base Rates.
The interest rate on each Floating Rate Note for each Interest Period will be determined by reference to (i) the applicable Base Rates specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement for such Interest Period, plus or minus any applicable Spread and/or multiplied by any applicable Spread Multiplier. The "Spread" is the number of basis points, each one-hundredth of a percentage point, specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement to be added or subtracted from the Base Rate for a Floating Rate Note. For example, if a Note bears interest at LIBOR plus one basis point, or .01%, and the Calculation Agent (as defined below) determines that LIBOR is 5.00% per annum, the Note will bear interest at 5.01% per annum until the next Interest Reset Date (as defined below). The "Spread Multiplier" is the percentage specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement to be applied to the Base Rate for a Floating Rate Note. For example, if a Note bears interest at 90% of LIBOR, and the Calculation Agent determines that
 
LIBOR is 5.00% per annum, the Note will bear interest at 4.50% per annum until the next Interest Reset Date.
Each Note that bears interest will bear interest from and including its date of issue (or other specified date on which interest begins to accrue) or from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date on which interest on such Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) has been paid or duly provided for (i) at the fixed rate per annum applicable to the related Interest Period, or (ii) at a rate per annum determined pursuant to the Base Rates applicable to the related Interest Period or Interest Periods, in each case as specified therein and in the applicable Pricing Supplement, until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment. Interest will be payable on each Interest Payment Date and at maturity or, if applicable, upon redemption. The first payment of interest on any Note originally issued after a Regular Record Date and on or before an Interest Payment Date will be made on the Interest Payment Date following the next succeeding Regular Record Date to the registered holder on such next succeeding Regular Record Date. Interest rates and Base Rates are subject to change by the Company from time to time but no such change will affect any Note theretofore issued or which the Company has agreed to issue. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the "Interest Payment Dates" and the "Regular Record Dates" for Fixed Rate Notes shall be as described below under "Fixed Rate Notes", and the "Interest Payment Dates" and the "Regular Record Dates" for Floating Rate Notes shall be as described below under "Floating Rate Notes".
The applicable Pricing Supplement will specify, among other things: (i) the issue price, Interest Payment Dates and Regular Record Dates; (ii) with respect to any Fixed Rate Note, the interest rate; (iii) with respect to any Floating Rate Note, the Initial Interest Rate (as defined below), the method (which may vary from Interest Period to Interest Period) of calculating the interest rate applicable to each Interest Period (including, if applicable, the fixed rate per annum applicable to one or more Interest Periods), the period to maturity of any instrument on which the Base Rate for any Interest Period is predicated (the "Index Maturity"), the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, the Interest Determination Dates (as defined below), the Interest Reset Dates and any Minimum Interest Rate or Maximum Interest Rate; (iv) whether such Note is an Original Issue Discount Note; and (v) any other terms related to interest on the Notes.
Fixed Rate Notes
Each Fixed Rate Note, whether or not issued as an Original Issue Discount Note, will bear interest at the annual rate specified therein and in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Interest Payment Dates for the Fixed Rate Notes will be on February 1 and August 1 of each year and at maturity or, if applicable, upon redemption, and the Regular Record Dates for the Fixed Rate Notes will be on the day (whether or not a Business Day) 15 calendar days preceding each Interest Payment Date. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, interest payments for Fixed Rate Notes shall be the amount of interest accrued to, but excluding, the relevant Interest Payment Date. Interest on Fixed Rate Notes will be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any Interest Payment Date or any applicable Redemption Date on a Fixed Rate Note is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date or
 
Redemption Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, and no interest will accrue for the period from and after the scheduled Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date, as the case may be.
Floating Rate Notes
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement and except as provided below, interest on Floating Rate Notes will be payable on the following Interest Payment Dates: in the case of Floating Rate Notes with a daily, weekly or monthly Interest Reset Date, on the third Wednesday of each month of each year; in the case of Floating Rate Notes with a quarterly Interest Reset Date, on the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December of each year; in the case of Floating Rate Notes with a semi-annual Interest Reset Date, on the third Wednesday of the two months of each year specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement; and in the case of Floating Rate Notes with an annual Interest Reset Date, on the third Wednesday of the month of each year specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Interest will also be paid at maturity or, if applicable, upon redemption. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Regular Record Dates for the Floating Rate Notes will be the day (whether or not a Business Day) 15 calendar days preceding each Interest Payment Date. In the event that any Interest Payment Date for any Floating Rate Note is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, that, for LIBOR Notes and EURIBOR Notes, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
provided
The rate of interest on each Floating Rate Note will be reset daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually (such specified period, an "Interest Reset Period", and the date on which each such reset occurs, an "Interest Reset Date"), as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Interest Reset Date will be as follows: in the case of Floating Rate Notes which are reset daily, each Business Day; in the case of Floating Rate Notes (other than Treasury Rate Notes) which are reset weekly, the Wednesday of each week; in the case of Floating Rate Notes that are Treasury Rate Notes which are reset weekly, the Tuesday of each week (except if the auction date falls on a Tuesday, then the next Business Day); in the case of Floating Rate Notes which are reset monthly, the third Wednesday of each month; in the case of Floating Rate Notes which are reset quarterly, the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December of each year; in the case of Floating Rate Notes which are reset semi-annually, the third Wednesday of the two months of each year specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement; and in the case of Floating Rate Notes which are reset annually, the third Wednesday of the month of each year specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
The interest rate in effect from the date of issue to the first Interest Reset Date with respect to a Floating Rate Note (the "Initial Interest Rate") will be as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. If any Interest Reset Date for any Floating Rate Note would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, that, for LIBOR Notes and EURIBOR Notes, if such
provided
 
Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the interest rate determined with respect to any Interest Determination Date will become effective on and as of the next succeeding Interest Reset Date. As used herein, "Interest Determination Date" means the date as of which the interest rate for a Floating Rate Note is to be calculated, to be effective as of the following Interest Reset Date and calculated on the related Calculation Date (as defined below). Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Interest Determination Date pertaining to any Interest Reset Date will be: for a Commercial Paper Rate Note, a CD Rate Note or a CMT Rate Note (the "Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date", the "CD Rate Interest Determination Date", and the "CMT Rate Interest Determination Date," respectively), the second Business Day prior to such Interest Reset Date; for Federal Funds Rate Notes and Prime Rate Notes (the "Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date" and the "Prime Rate Interest Determination Date", respectively), the Business Day immediately preceding the related Interest Reset Date; for EURIBOR Notes (the "EURIBOR Interest Determination Date"), the second TARGET Business Day before the Interest Reset Date; for LIBOR Notes (the "LIBOR Interest Determination Date"), the second London Business Day before the Interest Reset Date; and for a Treasury Rate Note (the "Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date") will be the Business Day (other than the Interest Reset Date) on which Treasury Bills (as defined below) would normally be auctioned in the week in which such Interest Reset Date falls. Treasury Bills are usually sold at auction on Monday of each week, unless that day is a legal holiday, in which case the auction is usually held on the following Tuesday, although it may be held on the preceding Friday. If, as the result of a legal holiday, an auction is so held on the preceding Friday, such Friday will be the Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date pertaining to the Interest Reset Date occurring in the next succeeding week. If an auction date shall fall on any Interest Reset Date for a Treasury Rate Note, then such Interest Reset Date shall instead be the first Business Day immediately following such auction date. The Interest Determination Date pertaining to a Floating Rate Note the interest rate of which is determined by reference to two or more Base Rates will be the latest Business Day which is at least two Business Days prior to such Interest Reset Date for such Floating Rate Note on which each such Base Rate is determinable.
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, interest payments on an Interest Payment Date for a Floating Rate Note will include interest accrued from, and including, the most recent Interest Payment Date on which interest has been paid or duly provided for (or, from, and including, the date of issue, or any date specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as the date on which interest begins to accrue, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for with respect to such Floating Rate Note). Interest will accrue to, but excluding, the next Interest Payment Date (each such interest accrual period, an "Interest Period"), or if earlier the date on which the principal is paid or duly made available for payment. Accrued interest from the date of issue, from such other specified date on which interest begins to accrue or from the last date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for to the date for which interest is being calculated shall be calculated by multiplying the face amount of a Floating Rate Note by the applicable accrued interest factor (the "Accrued Interest Factor"). The Accrued Interest Factor shall be computed by adding together the interest factors calculated for
 
each day in the relevant Interest Period. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the interest factor for each such day shall be computed by dividing the per annum interest rate, expressed as a decimal, applicable to such day by 360 in the case of Commercial Paper Rate Notes, Federal Funds Rate Notes, LIBOR Notes, EURIBOR Notes, Prime Rate Notes, and CD Rate Notes, or by the actual number of days in the year in the case of Treasury Rate Notes and CMT Rate Notes. The interest rate in effect on each day will be (i) if such day is an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with respect to the Interest Determination Date pertaining to such Interest Reset Date or (ii) if such day is not an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with respect to the Interest Determination Date relating to the next preceding Interest Reset Date, subject in either case to any Maximum Interest Rate or Minimum Interest Rate referred to above or in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, U.S. Bank National Association will be the "Calculation Agent". On or before each Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the interest rate in accordance with the foregoing and as described below with respect to the applicable Base Rate and notify the Company and the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will determine the Accrued Interest Factor applicable to any such Floating Rate Note. The Paying Agent will, upon the request of the holder of any Floating Rate Note, provide the interest rate then in effect and the interest rate which will become effective as a result of a determination made with respect to the most recent Interest Determination Date with respect to such Floating Rate Note. The determinations of interest rates made by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding, and neither the Trustee nor the Paying Agent shall have the duty to verify determinations of interest rates made by the Calculation Agent. The determinations of Accrued Interest Factors made by the Paying Agent shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the "Calculation Date", if applicable, pertaining to any Interest Determination Date on a Floating Rate Note will be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day after such Interest Determination Date, or, if any such day is not a Business Day, the following Business Day, and (ii) the Business Day before the applicable Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Maturity Date, as the case may be.
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, all percentages resulting from any calculation on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of one percentage point, with five one-millionths of one percentage point rounded upward (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) will be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655) and 9.876544% (or .09876544) will be rounded to 9.87654% (or .0987654)); all calculations of the Accrued Interest Factor for any day on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-millionth, with five one-billionths rounded upward (e.g. .098765455 will be rounded to .09876546 and .098765454 will be rounded to .09876545); and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculations on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward).
. If the Base Rate specified with respect to any Interest Period for a Floating Rate Note is the Commercial Paper Rate, such Floating Rate Note shall be a "Commercial Paper Rate Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to such Floating Rate Note for any Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period
Commercial Paper Rate
 
shall be the Commercial Paper Rate as adjusted by the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified in the Commercial Paper Rate Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Commercial Paper Rate Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any.
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, "Commercial Paper Rate" means, with respect to any Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date, the Money Market Yield (calculated as described below) of the rate on that date for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as published in "Statistical Release H.15(519), Selected Interest Rates" or any successor publication of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("H.15 (519)") under the heading "Commercial Paper  Nonfinancial."
Unless the applicable Pricing Supplement specifies otherwise, the following procedures will be followed if the Commercial Paper Rate cannot be determined as described above: (I) If the rate is not published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date relating to the Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date, then the Commercial Paper Rate will be the Money Market Yield of the rate on the Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as set forth in the daily update of H.15(519), available through the worldwide website of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/update, or any successor site or publication (the "H.15 Daily Update") under the heading "Commercial Paper  Nonfinancial;" (II) If by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date the rate is not published in either H.15(519) or the H.15 Daily Update, then the Calculation Agent shall determine the Commercial Paper Rate to be the Money Market Yield of the arithmetic mean of the offered rates as of 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date, of three leading dealers of commercial paper in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent, after consultation with the Company, for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement placed for an industrial issuer whose bond rating is "AA," or the equivalent, from a nationally recognized statistical rating agency; , that if the dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as described above in this sentence, the Commercial Paper Rate in effect immediately before the Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date will not change and will remain the Commercial Paper Rate in effect on such Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date.
provided, however
"Money Market Yield" shall be a yield calculated in accordance with the following formula:
 
where "D" refers to the applicable per annum rate for commercial paper, quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal, and "M" refers to the actual number of days in the Interest Period for which the interest is being calculated.
 
. If the Base Rate specified with respect to any Interest Period for a Floating Rate Note is the Federal Funds Rate, such Floating Rate Note shall be a "Federal Funds Rate Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to such Floating Rate Note for any Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period shall be the Federal Funds Rate as adjusted by the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified in the Federal Funds Rate Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Federal Funds Rate Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any. The Federal Funds Rate will be calculated by reference to either the Federal Funds (Effective) Rate, the Federal Funds Open Rate or the Federal Funds Target Rate, as specified in the Federal Funds Rate Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
Federal Funds Rate
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, "Federal Funds Rate" means the rate determined by the Calculation Agent, with respect to any Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date, in accordance with the following provisions:
(I) If "Federal Funds (Effective) Rate" is the specified Federal Funds Rate in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Federal Funds Rate as of the applicable Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate with respect to such date for United States dollar federal funds as published in H.15(519) opposite the caption "Federal Funds (Effective)," as such rate is displayed on Reuters on page FEDFUNDS1 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page FEDFUNDS1") under the heading "EFFECT," or, if such rate is not so published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the rate with respect to such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date for United States dollar federal funds as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "Federal funds (effective)." If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page FEDFUNDS1 or is not yet published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Federal Funds Rate with respect to such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight United States dollar federal funds arranged by three leading brokers of U.S. dollar federal funds transactions in New York City (which may include the Agents or their affiliates) selected by the Calculation Agent, prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date; , that if the brokers so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Federal Funds Rate determined as of such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date will be the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date.
provided, however
(II) If "Federal Funds Open Rate" is the specified Federal Funds Rate in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Federal Funds Rate as of the applicable Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate on such date under the heading "Federal Funds" for the relevant Index Maturity and opposite the caption "Open" as such rate is displayed on Reuters on page 5 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page 5"), or, if such rate does not appear on Reuters Page 5 by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the Federal Funds Rate for the Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date will be the rate for that day displayed on FFPREBON Index page on Bloomberg L.P.
 
("Bloomberg"), which is the Fed Funds Opening Rate as reported by Prebon Yamane (or a successor) on Bloomberg. If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page 5 or is not displayed on FFPREBON Index page on Bloomberg or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Federal Funds Rate on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight United States dollar federal funds arranged by three leading brokers of United States dollar federal funds transactions in New York City (which may include the Agents or their affiliates) selected by the Calculation Agent prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date; , that if the brokers so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Federal Funds Rate determined as of such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date will be the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date.
provided, however
(III) If "Federal Funds Target Rate" is the specified Federal Funds Rate in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Federal Funds Rate as of the applicable Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate on such date as displayed on the FDTR Index page on Bloomberg. If such rate does not appear on the FDTR Index page on Bloomberg by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the Federal Funds Rate for such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date will be the rate for that day appearing on Reuters Page USFFTARGET= (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page USFFTARGET="). If such rate does not appear on the FDTR Index page on Bloomberg or is not displayed on Reuters Page USFFTARGET= by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Federal Funds Rate on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight United States dollar federal funds arranged by three leading brokers of United States dollar federal funds transactions in New York City (which may include the Agents or their affiliates) selected by the Calculation Agent prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date.
. If the Base Rate specified with respect to any Interest Period for a Floating Rate Note is LIBOR, such Floating Rate Note shall be a "LIBOR Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to such Floating Rate Note for any Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period shall be LIBOR as adjusted by the Spread and/or the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified in the LIBOR Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement. LIBOR Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any.

as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date. If no such rate so appears, LIBOR on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be determined in accordance with the provisions described in clause (II) below.
(II) With respect to a LIBOR Interest Determination Date on which no rate is displayed on Reuters Page LIBOR01 as specified in clause (I) above, the Calculation Agent shall request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks (which may include affiliates of the Agents) in the London interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in the Designated LIBOR Currency for the period of the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, commencing on the related Interest Reset Date, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in the Designated LIBOR Currency in such market at such time. If at least two such quotations are so provided, then LIBOR on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean calculated by the Calculation Agent of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, then LIBOR on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean calculated by the Calculation Agent of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., in the applicable Principal Financial Center (as defined below), on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date by three major banks (which may include affiliates of the Agents) in such Principal Financial Center selected by the Calculation Agent for loans in the Designated LIBOR Currency to leading European banks, having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in the Designated LIBOR Currency in such market at such time; , that if the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, LIBOR determined as of such LIBOR Interest Determination Date shall be LIBOR in effect on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date.

EURIBOR Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any.
EURIBOR Rate
 
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, EURIBOR means with respect to any EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, a base rate equal to the interest rate for deposits in euro designated as "EURIBOR" and sponsored jointly by the European Banking Federation and ACI  the Financial Market Association, or any company established by the joint sponsors for purposes of compiling and publishing that rate. EURIBOR will be determined in the following manner:
(I) EURIBOR will be the offered rate for deposits in euro having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, beginning on the second euro Business Day after such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, as that rate appears on Reuters Page EURIBOR 01 as of 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date.
(II) If the rate described above does not appear on Reuters Page EURIBOR 01, EURIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates, at approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, at which deposits of the following kind are offered to prime banks in the euro-zone interbank market by the principal euro-zone office of each of four major banks in that market selected by the Calculation Agent: euro deposits having such EURIBOR Index Maturity, beginning on such EURIBOR Interest Reset Date, and in a representative amount. The Calculation Agent will request that the principal euro-zone office of each of these banks provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two quotations are provided, EURIBOR for such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations.
(III) If fewer than two quotations are provided as described above, EURIBOR for such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for loans of the following kind to leading euro-zone banks quoted, at approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time on that EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, by three major banks in the euro-zone selected by the Calculation Agent: loans of euro having such EURIBOR Index Maturity, beginning on such EURIBOR Interest Reset Date, and in an amount that is representative of a single transaction in euro in that market at the time.
(IV) If fewer than three banks selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as described above, EURIBOR for the new Interest Period will be EURIBOR in effect for the prior Interest Period. If the initial Base Rate has been in effect for the prior Interest Period, however, it will remain in effect for the new Interest Period.
. If the Base Rate specified with respect to any Interest Period for a Floating Rate Note is the Prime Rate, such Floating Rate Note shall be a "Prime Rate Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to such Floating Rate Note for any Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period shall be the Prime Rate as adjusted by the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified in the Prime Rate Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Prime Rate Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any.

Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, "Prime Rate" means, with respect to any Prime Rate Interest Determination Date, the rate on such date as such rate is published in H.15(519) under the caption "Bank prime loan" or, if not published by 3:00
 
p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, the rate on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "Bank prime loan." If such rate is not yet published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update, or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Prime Rate shall be the arithmetic mean calculated by the Calculation Agent of the rates of interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on Reuters on page USPRIME1 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major United States banks) ("Reuters Page USPRIME1") as such bank's prime rate or base lending rate as of 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date. If fewer than four such rates so appear on the Reuters Page USPRIME1 for such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Prime Rate shall be the arithmetic mean calculated by the Calculation Agent of the prime rates or base lending rates quoted on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by a 360-day year as of the close of business on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date by three major banks (which may include affiliates of the Agents) in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent; , that if the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Prime Rate determined as of such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date will be the Prime Rate in effect on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date.
provided, however
"Reuters Page USPRIME1" means the display on the Reuters 3000 Xtra Service (or any successor service) on the "USPRIME1 Page" (or such other page as may replace the USPRIME1 Page on such service) for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major U.S. banks.

CD Rate Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any.
CD Rate
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, "CD Rate" means, with respect to any CD Rate Interest Determination Date, the rate on that date for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as published in H.15(519), under the heading "CDs (Secondary Market)." If the CD Rate cannot be determined in this manner, the following procedures will apply:
(I) If the rate described above is not published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the relevant Calculation Date, then the CD Rate will be the rate on that CD Rate Interest Determination Date for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit having the specified Index Maturity as published in H.15 Daily Update, or other recognized electronic sources used for the purpose of displaying the applicable rate, under the caption "CDs (Secondary Market)."
 
(II) If by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the applicable Calculation Date, that rate is not published in either H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source, the CD Rate for that CD Rate Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on that CD Rate Interest Determination Date, of three leading non-bank dealers in negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit in New York City, which may include one or more of the Agents or their affiliates, selected by the Calculation Agent, after consultation with the Company, for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit of major U.S. money market banks for negotiable certificates of deposit with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time.
(III) If the dealer(s) selected as described above by the Calculation Agent are not quoting rates as set forth above, the CD Rate for that CD interest rate determination date will be the CD Rate in effect for the immediately preceding interest reset period, or if there was no interest reset period, then the rate of interest payable will be the Initial Interest Rate.
. If the Base Rate specified with respect to any Interest Period for a Floating Rate Note is the Treasury Rate, such Floating Rate Note shall be a "Treasury Rate Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to such Floating Rate Note for any Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period shall be the Treasury Rate as adjusted by the Spread and/or the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified in the Treasury Rate Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Treasury Rate Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any.
Treasury Rate
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date, the rate from the auction held on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date (the "Auction") of direct obligations of the United States ("Treasury Bills") having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement under the caption "INVEST RATE" on the display on Reuters page USAUCTION10 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) or page USAUCTION11 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) or, if not so published at 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, the Bond Equivalent Yield (as defined below) of the rate for such Treasury Bills as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Bills/Auction High." If such rate is not so published in the related H.15 Daily Update or another recognized source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, the Treasury Rate on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the Auction rate of such Treasury Bills as announced by the United States Department of the Treasury. In the event that such Auction rate is not so announced by the United States Department of the Treasury on such Calculation Date, or if no such Auction is held, then the Treasury Rate on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the rate on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date of Treasury Bills having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as published in H.15(519) under the caption "U.S. government
 
securities/treasury bills/secondary market" or, if not yet published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, the rate on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date of such Treasury Bills as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "U.S. government securities/treasury bills (secondary market)." If such rate is not yet published in the H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Treasury Rate on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid rates, as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date, of the three leading primary United States government securities dealers (which may include the Agents or their affiliates) selected by the Calculation Agent, for the issue of Treasury Bills with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement; , that if the dealers so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Treasury Rate determined as of such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date will be the Treasury Rate in effect on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date.
provided, however
The "Bond Equivalent Yield" means a yield (expressed as a percentage) calculated in accordance with the following formula:
 
where "D" refers to the applicable per annum rate for Treasury Bills quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal, "N" refers to 365 or 366, as the case may be, and "M" refers to the actual number of days in the applicable Interest Reset Period.
. If the Base Rate specified with respect to any Interest Period for a Floating Rate Note is the CMT Rate, such Floating Rate Note is a "CMT Rate Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to such Floating Rate Note for any Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period shall be the CMT Rate as adjusted by the Spread and/or the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified in the CMT Rate Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement. CMT Rate Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any.
CMT Rate
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, "CMT Rate" means, with respect to any CMT Rate Interest Determination Date:
(I) If "Reuters Page FRBCMT" is the specified CMT Reuters Page in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the CMT Rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as set forth in H.15(519) under the caption "Treasury constant maturities," as such yield is displayed on Reuters (or any successor service) on page FRBCMT (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page FRBCMT") for such CMT Rate Interest Determination
 
Date. If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page FRBCMT, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement and for such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date as set forth in H.15(519) under the caption "Treasury constant maturities." If such rate does not appear in H.15(519), the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate for the period of the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as may then be published by either the Federal Reserve Board or the United States Department of the Treasury that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to the rate that would otherwise have been published in H.15(519). If the Federal Reserve Board or the United States Department of the Treasury does not publish a yield on United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement for such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices at approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three leading primary United States government securities dealers in New York City (which may include the Agents or their affiliates) (each, a "Reference Dealer") selected by the Calculation Agent from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity equal to the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, a remaining term to maturity no more than one year shorter than such Index Maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time. If fewer than three prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, a remaining term to maturity closest to such Index Maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time. If two such United States Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement have remaining terms to maturity equally close to such Index Maturity, the quotes for the treasury security with the shorter original term to maturity will be used. If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor the lowest of such quotations shall be eliminated; provided, however, that if fewer than three such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate determined as of such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the CMT Rate in effect on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date.
 
(II) If "Reuters Page FEDCMT" is the specified CMT Reuters Page in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the CMT Rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the one-week or one-month, as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, average yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as set forth in H.15(519) opposite the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," as such yield is displayed on Reuters on page FEDCMT (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page FEDCMT") for the week or month, as applicable, ended immediately preceding the week or month, as applicable, in which such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date falls. If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page FEDCMT, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the one-week or one-month, as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, average yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement for the week or month, as applicable, preceding such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date as set forth in H.15(519) opposite the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities." If such rate does not appear in H.15(519), the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the one-week or one-month, as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, average yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as otherwise announced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the week or month, as applicable, ended immediately preceding the week or month, as applicable, in which such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date falls. If the Federal Reserve Bank of New York does not publish a one-week or one-month, as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, average yield on United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement for the applicable week or month, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices at approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity equal to the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, a remaining term to maturity of no more than one year shorter than such Index Maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time. If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date calculated by the Calculation Agent based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor the lowest of such quotation shall be eliminated. If fewer than three prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity longer than the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing
 
Supplement, a remaining term to maturity closest to such Index Maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time. If two United States Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement have remaining terms to maturity equally close to such Index Maturity, the quotes for the Treasury security with the shorter original term to maturity will be used. If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date calculated by the Calculation Agent based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor lowest of such quotations shall be eliminated; , that if fewer than three such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate determined as of such CMT Rate determination date shall be the CMT Rate in effect on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date.
provided, however
Zero Coupon Notes
The specific terms of any Zero Coupon Notes will be set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
(6) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, principal of (and premium, if any) and interest (if any) on the Notes will be payable, and, except as described in the Prospectus Supplement, dated April 27, 2009, relating to the issuance of the Notes, and the Administrative Procedures attached hereto as Exhibit F with respect to any Global Security (as defined below) representing Book-Entry Notes (as defined below), the transfer of the Notes will be registrable and Notes will be exchangeable for Notes bearing identical terms and provisions at the corporate trust office of U.S. Bank National Association (the "Paying Agent," unless another Paying Agent is specified in an applicable Pricing Supplement), in New York, New York, provided that payments of principal and any premium and interest with respect to any Registered Note may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the address of the person or entity entitled thereto as it appears on the security register of the Company, except that holders of $10,000,000 or more in aggregate principal amount of similar Notes shall be entitled to receive payments by wire transfer of immediately available funds, if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been given to the Trustee or Paying Agent in writing not later than ten Business Days prior to the applicable Interest Payment Date. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, U.S. Bank National Association will be the "Security Registrar" with respect to the Notes. The Paying Agent or Security Registrar may be terminated or resign from its role as such with respect to the Notes as long as another agent is in place to serve in such role.
(7) If so specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Company on the date or dates prior to maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement at the price or prices specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Unless otherwise specified in such Pricing Supplement, in the case of Notes other than Zero Coupon Notes or certain interest bearing notes issued as Original Issue Discount Notes, the redemption price will be expressed as a specified percentage of the principal amount of such Note, together with accrued interest, if any, to the date of redemption stated in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement,
 
in the case of Zero Coupon Notes or certain interest bearing Notes issued as Original Issue Discount Notes (as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement), the redemption price will be a specified percentage of the Amortized Face Amount (as defined below) of such Note (as described in paragraph (13) below), together with accrued interest, if any, to the date of redemption (or, in the case of any interest bearing Note issued as an Original Issue Discount Note, any accrued but unpaid "qualified stated interest" payments (as specified in Paragraph (13) below).

(8) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Company shall not be obligated to redeem or purchase any Notes of such series pursuant to any sinking fund or analogous provisions or at the option of any Holder.
(9) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Notes may be issued only in fully registered form. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the authorized denomination of the Notes of such series other than Foreign Currency Notes (as defined below), shall be $1,000 or any amount in excess of $1,000 which is an integral multiple of $1,000. Foreign Currency Notes will be issued in the denominations specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
(10) The Notes may be denominated, and payments of principal of and interest on the Notes will be made, in United States dollars or in such foreign currencies or foreign currency units as may be specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement (each such specified foreign currency, a "Specified Currency"). In the case of a Note having a Specified Currency (a "Foreign Currency Note"), the Company will (unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement) arrange to convert all payments in respect of such Foreign Currency Note into U.S. dollars. The amount of any U.S. dollar payment in respect of a Foreign Currency Note will be based on the bid quoted by the exchange rate agent for the purchase of U.S. dollars with the Specified Currency for settlement on the payment date and on the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to all Holders of the Foreign Currency Notes who are scheduled to receive such payments. The bid quotation will be as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on the second day preceding the applicable payment date on which banks are open for business in London and New York City. If this bid quotation is not available, such exchange rate agent will obtain a bid quotation from a leading foreign exchange bank in London or New York City selected by such exchange rate agent for this purchase. If these bids are not available, payment of the aggregate amount due to all Holders of Foreign Currency Notes on the payment date will be made in the Specified Currency. All currency exchange costs will be borne by the Holder of the Note by deductions from such payments due such Holder. If so indicated in a Foreign Currency Note and the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Holder thereof may elect to receive all payments in respect of such Note in the Specified Currency by delivery of a written notice to the applicable Paying Agent not later than 15 calendar days prior to the applicable payment date, and such election shall remain in effect until revoked by written notice to such Paying Agent received not later than 15 calendar days prior to the applicable payment date.
 
(11) Except as otherwise described in Paragraph (5) above and Paragraph (13) below, the amount of payments of principal of and any premium or interest on the Notes will not be determined with reference to an index.
(12) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Events of Default with respect to the Notes are those specified in Section 5.01 of the Indenture. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the events that constitute Acceleration Events with respect to the Notes shall be those set forth as such in the Indenture.
(13) The portion of the principal amount of the Notes, other than Original Issue Discount Notes (including any Zero Coupon Notes), which shall be payable upon declaration of acceleration of maturity thereof shall not be other than the principal amount thereof. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the portion of the principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes and certain interest bearing Notes issued as Original Issue Discount Notes (as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement) upon any acceleration of the maturity thereof will be the Amortized Face Amount and in the case of an interest-bearing note issued as an Original Issue Discount Note, any accrued but unpaid qualified stated interest payments. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the amount payable to the holder of such Original Issue Discount Note upon any redemption thereof will be the applicable specified percentage of the Amortized Face Amount thereof specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, and in the case of any interest bearing Note issued as an Original Issue Discount Note, any accrued but unpaid "qualified stated interest" payments (as defined in the Treasury Regulations regarding original issue discount issued by the Treasury Department (the "Regulations")). The "Amortized Face Amount" of an Original Issue Discount Note is equal to the sum of (i) the Issue Price (as defined below) of such Original Issue Discount Note and (ii) that portion of the difference between the Issue Price and the principal amount of such original Issue Discount Note that has been amortized at the Stated Yield (as defined below) of such Original Issue Discount Note (computed in accordance with Section 1272(a)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and Section 1.1275-1(b) of the Regulations, in each case as in effect on the issue date of such Original Issue Discount Note) at the date as of which the Amortized Face Amount is calculated. In no event can the Amortized Face Amount exceed the principal amount of such Note due at the stated maturity thereof. As used in the preceding sentence, the term "Issue Price" means the principal amount of such Original Issue Discount Note due at the stated maturity thereof less the "Original Issue Discount" of such Original Issue Discount Note specified on the face thereof and in the applicable Pricing Supplement. The term "Stated Yield" of such Original Issue Discount Note means the "Yield to Maturity" specified on the face of such Original Issue Discount Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement for the period from the Original Issue Date of such Original Issue Discount Note, as specified on the face of such Original Issue Discount Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement, to the stated maturity thereof based on its Issue Price and stated redemption price at maturity thereof.
(14) Each Note will be represented by either a master global note or a global note in fully registered form (each a "Global Note") registered in the name of a nominee of the Depositary (each such Note represented by a Global Note being herein referred to as a "Book-Entry Note") or a certificate issued in definitive registered form, without coupons (a "Certificated Note"), as set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Unless otherwise
 
specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, The Depository Trust Company will act as Depositary. Except as provided in Section 2.06 of the Indenture or in the applicable Note, Book-Entry Notes will not be issuable in certificated form and will not be exchangeable or transferable. So long as the Depositary or its nominee is the registered holder of any Global Note, the Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole Holder of the Book-Entry Note or Notes represented by such Global Note for all purposes under the Indenture and the Notes.
(15) The Notes shall be subject to the subordination provisions contained in Article Three of the Indenture.
(16) Subject to the terms of the Indenture and the resolutions and authorization referred to in the first paragraph hereof, each Note shall have such other terms (which may be in addition to or different from the terms set forth herein and which may differ from the terms of other Notes) as are specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.

In accordance with the Indenture and Officers' Certificate, the Notes may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption and repayment provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and events of default, and may otherwise vary as therein provided or permitted. The Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of Notes that the Company may issue.
(
If possible Redemption Dates or periods within which Redemption Dates may occur and the related Redemption Prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount of this Note) are set forth on the face hereof under "Redemption Terms", unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, this Note is subject to redemption prior to the Maturity Date upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice mailed to the Person in whose name this Note is registered at such address as shall appear in the Security Register of the Company, on any Redemption Date so specified or occurring within any period so specified, as a whole or in part, at the election of the Company, at the applicable Redemption Price so specified, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date, that installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable in the case of any such redemption to the holder of this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates referred to on the face hereof, all in accordance with the terms hereof and as provided in the Indenture. If less than all of the Notes of like tenor and terms are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select the Notes to be redeemed by a method that the Trustee deems fair and appropriate. In the event of redemption of less than all of the principal of this Note, a new Note of this series and of like tenor and terms of an authorized denomination for the unredeemed portion of this Note will be issued in the name of the holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, under "Redemption Terms", this Note is not subject to any sinking fund, and the Company will not be obligated to redeem, purchase or repay this Note pursuant to a sinking fund or analogous provision or at the option of the holder.
provided, however,
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the events that constitute Events of Default with respect to this Note shall be as set forth in the Indenture. If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of all the Notes may (subject to the conditions set forth in the Indenture) be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of Securities Outstanding under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected, although certain modifications cannot be made without the consent of the holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby. The Indenture also permits the Company and the Trustee to modify the Indenture in certain circumstances without the consent of the holders of any Securities at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the holders of all Notes, prior to any acceleration of the principal of the Notes, to waive any past default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences, except a default under a covenant that cannot be modified without the consent of each holder of a Note affected thereby. In addition, the
 
holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may waive all defaults and rescind a declaration of acceleration of the Notes if certain conditions are satisfied. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall impair or affect, without the consent of a holder of this Note, the right of such holder to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note on or after the respective Stated Maturities, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates against the Company.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations and of like tenor and terms of the same series, as requested by the holder surrendering the same.
No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Exhibit 4.9(b)
This Note is a Global Security within the meaning of the Indenture referred to herein and is registered in the name of a Depositary or a nominee of a Depositary. Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation ("DTC") to the issuer or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange, or payment, and any certificate issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof has an interest herein.
 
 
 
a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of North Carolina (herein called the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to or registered assigns, the principal sum of on the Maturity Date shown above or, together with any premium thereon, upon any applicable Redemption Date, and to pay interest thereon from the Original Issue Date or such other date shown above or, except as otherwise specified below, from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, on each Interest Payment Date shown above, commencing with the Interest Payment Date immediately following the Original Issue Date or such other date shown above, at the rate per annum determined in accordance with the provisions set forth on the reverse side hereof relating to the applicable Base Rate specified above, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment; , that if the Original Issue Date is between a Regular Record Date and an Interest Payment Date, the initial interest payment will be made on the Interest Payment Date following the next succeeding Regular Record Date to the registered holder on such next succeeding Regular Record Date. The interest so payable and punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date related to the Interest Payment Date, which, unless otherwise specified under "Other Terms" above, shall be the day (whether or not a Business Day) 15 calendar days preceding each Interest Payment Date; , that interest payable on the Maturity Date of this Note or any applicable Redemption Date shall be payable to the Person to whom principal shall be payable. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the holder hereof on such Regular Record Date and may be paid in accordance with the Indenture (i) to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice of which shall be given to the holder of this Note not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date; or (ii) in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by any such exchange, if such manner of payment is deemed practicable by the Trustee. In the event that any Maturity Date or Redemption Date is not a Business Day, the principal otherwise payable on such date will be paid on the next day that is a Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Maturity Date or Redemption Date, as applicable, and no interest will accrue for the period from and after such Maturity Date or Redemption Date to such next following Business Day. In the event that any Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, that, for LIBOR Notes and EURIBOR Notes, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Note due on the Maturity Date or any applicable Redemption Date will be made in immediately available funds to The Depository Trust Company, as depositary, or its nominee or registered assigns as the registered owner of this Note; that the Company may, at its option, pay principal and any premium and interest with respect to any Registered Note by mailing a check to the address of the Person entitled to payment as it appears on the Security Register, except that a holder of $10,000,000 (or the equivalent of $10,000,000 in a currency other than U.S. dollars) or more in aggregate principal amount of Notes of like tenor and terms shall be entitled to receive payments by wire transfer of immediately available funds if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received in writing by the Trustee or the applicable Paying Agent not later than 10 Business Days prior to the applicable payment date. If possible Redemption Dates or periods within which Redemption Dates may occur and the related Redemption Prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount of this Note) are set forth above under "Redemption Terms", unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, this Note is subject to redemption, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company prior to the Maturity Date upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice mailed to the registered holder of the Note.

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of the Company's unsecured, unsurbordinated medium-term notes, Series A due nine months or more from the date of issue (herein called the "Notes"), issued or to be issued under the Indenture Regarding Senior Securities, dated as of May 24, 1996, as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 4, 2009 (as so amended, and as may be further amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association (as successor to the corporate trust business of State Street Bank and Trust Company), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture, including all indentures supplemental thereto, along with the Officers' Certificate and Company Orderthe "Officers' Certificate"), dated May 4, 2009, with respect to, among other things, the establishment of the Notes, reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes and the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. In accordance with the Indenture and Officers' Certificate, the Notes may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption and repayment provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and events of default, and may otherwise vary as therein provided or permitted. The Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of Notes that the Company may issue.
(
General
The rate of interest for this Note will be determined by reference to one or more Base Rates specified on the face hereof, which may be adjusted by a Spread and/or Spread Multiplier. The "Spread" is the number of basis points, each one-hundredth of a percentage point, specified on the face hereof to be added or subtracted from the Base Rate specified on the face hereof. The "Spread Multiplier" is the percentage specified on the face hereof to be applied to the Base Rate specified on the face hereof. This Note may also have either or both of the following: (i) a Maximum Interest Rate, or ceiling, on the rate at which interest will accrue during any Interest Reset Period; and (ii) a Minimum Interest Rate, or floor, on the rate at which interest will accrue during any Interest Reset Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate per annum hereon shall not be greater than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or less than the Minimum Interest Rate, if any, specified on the face hereof. The interest rate on this Note will in no event exceed the maximum rate permitted by New York law as the same may be modified by United States law of general application. Under present New York law, the maximum rate of interest is (on a simple interest basis) 16% for a loan of less than $250,000, 25% for a loan of at least $250,000 but less than $2,500,000, and unlimited for a loan of $2,500,000 or more.
Commencing with the Interest Reset Date specified on the face hereof, first following the Original Issue Date specified on the face hereof, the rate at which this Note bears interest will be reset daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually (such specified period, an "Interest Reset Period," and the date on which each such reset occurs, an "Interest Reset Date"). Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," the Interest Reset Date will be as follows: in the case of Notes which are reset daily, each Business Day; in the case of Notes (other than Treasury Rate Notes) which are reset weekly, the Wednesday of each week; in the case of Treasury Rate Notes which are reset weekly, the Tuesday of each week (except if the auction date falls on a Tuesday, then the next Business Day, as provided below); in the case of Notes which are reset monthly, the third Wednesday of each month; in the case of Notes which are reset quarterly, the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December of each year; in the case of Notes which are reset semi-annually, the third Wednesday of the two months of each year as indicated on the face hereof, by the Interest Reset Dates; and in the case of Notes which are reset annually, the third Wednesday of the month of each year as indicated on the face hereof, by the Interest Reset Dates. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the interest rate determined with respect to any Interest Determination Date (as defined below) will become effective on the next succeeding Interest Reset Date; , that the interest rate in effect from the Original Issue Date to the first Interest Reset Date with respect to this Note (the "Initial Interest Rate") will be as set forth on the face hereof. If any Interest Reset Date for any Note would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the
provided, however
 
next day that is a Business Day, provided that, for LIBOR Notes and EURIBOR Notes, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. Subject to applicable provisions of law and except as specified herein, on each Interest Reset Date the rate of interest on this Note shall be the rate determined in accordance with the provisions of the applicable heading below.
As used herein, "Interest Determination Date" is the date that the Calculation Agent will refer to when determining the new interest rate at which the interest rate on a Floating Rate Note will reset and is the date as of which the interest rate for this Note is to be calculated, to be effective as of the following Interest Reset Date and calculated on the related Calculation Date (as defined below). Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," the Interest Determination Date pertaining to an Interest Reset Date: for a Commercial Paper Rate Note, a CD Rate Note, or a CMT Rate Note (the "Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date", the "CD Rate Interest Determination Date", and the "CMT Rate Interest Determination Date", respectively) will be the second Business Day before the Interest Reset Date; for Federal Funds Rate Notes and Prime Rate Notes will be the Business Day immediately preceding the related Interest Reset Date (the "Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date" and the "Prime Rate Interest Determination Date", respectively); for EURIBOR Notes will be the second TARGET Business Day before the Interest Reset Date (the "EURIBOR Interest Determination Date"); for LIBOR Notes will be the second London Business Day before the Interest Reset Date (the "LIBOR Interest Determination Date"); and for a Treasury Rate Note (the "Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date") will be the Business Day (other than the Interest Reset Date) on which Treasury Bills would normally be auctioned in the week in which such Interest Reset Date falls. Treasury Bills are usually sold at auction on Monday of each week, unless that day is a legal holiday, in which case the auction is usually held on the following Tuesday, although it may be held on the preceding Friday. If, as the result of a legal holiday, an auction is so held on the preceding Friday, that Friday will be the Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date pertaining to the Interest Reset Date occurring in the next week. If an auction falls on a day that is an Interest Reset Date for a Treasury Rate Note, the Interest Reset Date will be the following Business Day. The Interest Determination Date for a Floating Rate Note, which interest rate is determined by two or more Base Rates, will be the latest Business Day which is at least two Business Days prior to the Interest Reset Date for such Floating Rate Note on which each such Base Rate can be determined.
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," interest payments on this Note on an Interest Payment Date will accrue from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date on which interest is paid or duly provided for, or if no interest is paid or duly provided for, the date will be from and including the Original Issue Date or any other date specified on the face hereof on which interest begins to accrue. Interest will accrue to, but excluding, the next Interest Payment Date, or if earlier, the date on which the principal is paid or duly made available for payment. Accrued interest is calculated by multiplying the face amount of this Note by the applicable accrued interest factor (the "Accrued Interest Factor"). This Accrued Interest Factor is the sum of the interest factors calculated for each day from the Original Issue Date or any other date specified on the face hereof from which interest begins to accrue, or from the last date on which interest has been paid or duly provided for, to, but excluding the date for which accrued interest is being calculated. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the interest factor for each such day is computed by dividing the annual interest rate, expressed as a decimal, applicable to that day by 360 in the case of Commercial Paper Rate Notes, Federal Funds Rate Notes, LIBOR Notes, EURIBOR Notes, Prime Rate Notes, and CD Rate Notes, or by the actual number of days in the year in the case of Treasury Rate Notes and CMT Rate Notes. The interest rate in effect on each day will be (i) if the day is an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate for the Interest Determination Date related to the Interest Reset Date or (ii) if the day is not an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate for the Interest Determination Date related to the next preceding Interest Reset Date, subject in either case to the Maximum Interest Rate or Minimum Interest Rate referred to on the face hereof.
On or before each Calculation Date (as defined below), U.S. Bank National Association, as Calculation Agent (the "Calculation Agent"), will determine the interest rate in accordance with the foregoing with respect to the applicable Base Rate and will notify the Company and the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will determine the Accrued Interest Factor applicable to this Note. The Paying Agent will, upon the request of the holder of this Note, provide the interest rate then in effect and the interest rate which will become effective as a result of a determination made with respect to the most recent Interest Determination Date with respect to this Note. The determinations of interest rates made by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding, and neither the Trustee nor the Paying Agent shall have the duty to verify determinations of interest rates made by the Calculation Agent. The determinations of Accrued Interest Factors made by the Paying Agent shall, in the absence
 
of manifest error, be conclusive and binding. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," the "Calculation Date" means the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day after such Interest Determination Date, or, if that day is not a Business Day, the following Business Day, and (ii) the Business Day before the applicable Interest Payment Date, Maturity Date or Redemption Date, as the case may be.
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," all percentages resulting from any calculation on this Note, will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward. For example, 9.876545% (or .09876545) will be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655) and 9.876544% (or .09876544) will be rounded to 9.87654% (or .0987654). All calculations of the Accrued Interest Factor for any day on the Notes will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-millionth, with five one-billionths rounded upward (e.g., .098765455 will be rounded to .09876546 and .098765454 will be rounded to .09876545). All dollar amounts used in or resulting from any calculation on this Note will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward.
Determination of Commercial Paper Rate
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof with respect to any Interest Period is the Commercial Paper Rate, this Note is a "Commercial Paper Rate Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to this Note for any Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period shall be the Commercial Paper Rate as adjusted by the Spread and/or the Spread Multiplier, if any, as specified on the face hereof, as determined on the applicable Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date. Commercial Paper Rate Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any.
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," "Commercial Paper Rate" means, with respect to any Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date, the Money Market Yield (calculated as described below) of the rate on that date for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as published in "Statistical Release H.15(519), Selected Interest Rates" or any successor publication of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("H.15 (519)") under the heading "Commercial Paper  Nonfinancial."
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the following procedures will be followed if the Commercial Paper Rate cannot be determined as described above:
(1) If the rate is not published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date relating to the Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date, then the Commercial Paper Rate will be the Money Market Yield of the rate on the Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as set forth in the daily update of H.15(519), available through the worldwide website of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/update, or any successor site or publication (the "H.15 Daily Update") under the heading "Commercial Paper  Nonfinancial."
(2) If by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date the rate is not published in either H.15(519) or the H.15 Daily Update, then the Calculation Agent shall determine the Commercial Paper Rate to be the Money Market Yield of the arithmetic mean of the offered rates as of 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date, of three leading dealers of commercial paper in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent, after consultation with the Company, for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof placed for an industrial issuer whose bond rating is "AA," or the equivalent, from a nationally recognized statistical rating agency; , that if the dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as described above in this sentence, the Commercial Paper Rate in effect immediately before the Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date will not change and will remain the Commercial Paper Rate in effect on the Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date.
provided, however
 
"Money Market Yield" shall be a yield calculated in accordance with the following formula:
 
where "D" refers to the applicable per annum rate for the commercial paper, quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal, and "M" refers to the actual number of days in the Interest Period for which the interest is being calculated.
Determination of Federal Funds Rate
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof with respect to any Interest Period is the Federal Funds Rate, this Note is a "Federal Funds Rate Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to this Note for any Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period shall be the Federal Funds Rate as adjusted by the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any, as specified on the face hereof, as determined on the applicable Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date. Federal Funds Rate Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any. The Federal Funds Rate will be calculated by reference to either the Federal Funds (Effective) Rate, the Federal Funds Open Rate or the Federal Funds Target Rate, as specified on the face hereof.
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," "Federal Funds Rate" means the rate determined by the Calculation Agent, with respect to any Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date, in accordance with the following provisions:
(1) If "Federal Funds (Effective) Rate" is the specified Federal Funds Rate on the face hereof, the Federal Funds Rate as of the applicable Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate with respect to such date for United States dollar federal funds as published in H.15(519) opposite the caption "Federal Funds (Effective)," as such rate is displayed on Reuters on page FEDFUNDS1 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page FEDFUNDS1") under the heading "EFFECT," or, if such rate is not so published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the rate with respect to such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date for United States dollar federal funds as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "Federal funds (effective)." If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page FEDFUNDS1 or is not yet published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Federal Funds Rate with respect to such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight United States dollar federal funds arranged by three leading brokers of U.S. dollar federal funds transactions in New York City (which may include the Agents or their affiliates) selected by the Calculation Agent, prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date; that if the brokers so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Federal Funds Rate determined as of such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date will be the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date.
provided, however,
(2) If "Federal Funds Open Rate" is the specified Federal Funds Rate on the face hereof, the Federal Funds Rate as of the applicable Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate on such date under the heading "Federal Funds" for the relevant Index Maturity and opposite the caption "Open" as such rate is displayed on Reuters on page 5 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page 5"), or, if such rate does not appear on Reuters Page 5 by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the Federal Funds Rate for the Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date will be the rate for that day displayed on FFPREBON Index page on Bloomberg L.P. ("Bloomberg"), which is the Fed Funds Opening Rate as reported by Prebon Yamane (or a successor) on Bloomberg. If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page 5 or is not displayed on FFPREBON Index page on Bloomberg or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Federal Funds Rate on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight United States dollar federal funds arranged by three leading brokers of United States dollar federal funds transactions in New York City (which may include the Agents or their affiliates) selected by the
 
Calculation Agent prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date; that if the brokers so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Federal Funds Rate determined as of such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date will be the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date.
provided, however,
(3) If "Federal Funds Target Rate" is the specified Federal Funds Rate on the face hereof, the Federal Funds Rate as of the applicable Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate on such date as displayed on the FDTR Index page on Bloomberg. If such rate does not appear on the FDTR Index page on Bloomberg by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the Federal Funds Rate for such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date will be the rate for that day appearing on Reuters Page USFFTARGET= (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page USFFTARGET="). If such rate does not appear on the FDTR Index page on Bloomberg or is not displayed on Reuters Page USFFTARGET= by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Federal Funds Rate on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight United States dollar federal funds arranged by three leading brokers of United States dollar federal funds transactions in New York City (which may include the Agents or their affiliates) selected by the Calculation Agent prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date.
Determination of LIBOR
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof with respect to any Interest Period is LIBOR, this Note is a "LIBOR Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to this Note for any Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period shall be LIBOR as adjusted by the Spread and/or the Spread Multiplier, if any, as specified on the face hereof, as determined on the applicable LIBOR Interest Determination Date. LIBOR Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any.
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," "LIBOR" will be determined by the Calculation Agent with respect to each LIBOR Interest Determination Date in accordance with the following provisions:
(1) With respect to a LIBOR Interest Determination Date, LIBOR will be the rate for deposits in the Designated LIBOR Currency having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as such rate is displayed on Reuters on page LIBOR01 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service for the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks for the Designated LIBOR Currency) ("Reuters Page LIBOR01") as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date. If no such rate so appears, LIBOR on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be determined in accordance with the provisions described in clause (2) below.
(2) With respect to a LIBOR Interest Determination Date on which no rate is displayed on Reuters Page LIBOR01 as specified in clause (1) above, the Calculation Agent shall request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks (which may include affiliates of the Agents) in the London interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in the Designated LIBOR Currency for the period of the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, commencing on the related Interest Reset Date, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in the Designated LIBOR Currency in such market at such time. If at least two such quotations are so provided, then LIBOR on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean calculated by the Calculation Agent of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, then LIBOR on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean calculated by the Calculation Agent of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., in the applicable Principal Financial Center (as defined below), on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date by three major banks (which may include affiliates of the Agents) in such Principal Financial Center selected by the Calculation Agent for loans in the Designated LIBOR Currency to leading European banks, having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in the Designated LIBOR Currency in such market at such time; that if the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence,
provided, however,
 
LIBOR determined as of such LIBOR Interest Determination Date shall be LIBOR in effect on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date.
As referenced above, "Designated LIBOR Currency" means the currency specified on the face hereof as to which LIBOR shall be calculated or, if no such Designated LIBOR Currency is specified on the face hereof, U.S. dollars. As used in this section regarding the determination of LIBOR, "Principal Financial Center" means (i) the capital city of the country issuing the specified currency or (ii) the capital city of the country to which the Designated LIBOR Currency, if applicable, relates, except, in each case, that with respect to United States dollars, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, euro, New Zealand dollars, South African rand and Swiss francs, the "Principal Financial Center" shall be New York City, Sydney, Toronto, London (solely in the case of the Designated LIBOR Currency), Wellington, Johannesburg and Zurich, respectively.
Determination of EURIBOR
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof with respect to any Interest Period is EURIBOR, this Note is a "EURIBOR Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to this Note for any Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period shall be the EURIBOR Rate as adjusted by the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any, as specified on the face hereof, as determined on the applicable EURIBOR Interest Determination Date. EURIBOR Rate Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any.
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," EURIBOR means, with respect to any EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, a base rate equal to the interest rate for deposits in euro designated as "EURIBOR" and sponsored jointly by the European Banking Federation and ACI  the Financial Market Association, or any company established by the joint sponsors for purposes of compiling and publishing that rate. EURIBOR will be determined in the following manner:
(1) EURIBOR will be the offered rate for deposits in euro having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, beginning on the second euro Business Day after such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, as that rate appears on Reuters Page EURIBOR 01 as of 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date.
(2) If the rate described above does not appear on Reuters Page EURIBOR 01, EURIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates, at approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, at which deposits of the following kind are offered to prime banks in the euro-zone interbank market by the principal euro-zone office of each of four major banks in that market selected by the Calculation Agent: euro deposits having such EURIBOR Index Maturity, beginning on such EURIBOR Interest Reset Date, and in a representative amount. The Calculation Agent will request that the principal euro-zone office of each of these banks provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two quotations are provided, EURIBOR for such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations.
(3) If fewer than two quotations are provided as described above, EURIBOR for such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for loans of the following kind to leading euro-zone banks quoted, at approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time on that EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, by three major banks in the euro-zone selected by the Calculation Agent: loans of euro having such EURIBOR Index Maturity, beginning on such EURIBOR Interest Reset Date, and in an amount that is representative of a single transaction in euro in that market at the time.
(4) If fewer than three banks selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as described above, EURIBOR for the new Interest Period will be EURIBOR in effect for the prior Interest Period. If the initial Base Rate has been in effect for the prior Interest Period, however, it will remain in effect for the new Interest Period.
 
Determination of Prime Rate
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof with respect to any Interest Period is the Prime Rate, this Note is a "Prime Rate Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to this Note for any Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period shall be the Prime Rate as adjusted by the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any, as specified on the face hereof, as determined on the applicable Prime Rate Interest Determination Date. Prime Rate Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any.
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," "Prime Rate" means, with respect to any Prime Rate Interest Determination Date, the rate on such date as such rate is published in H.15(519) under the caption "Bank prime loan" or, if not published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, the rate on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "Bank prime loan." If such rate is not yet published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update, or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Prime Rate shall be the arithmetic mean calculated by the Calculation Agent of the rates of interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on Reuters on page USPRIME1 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major United States banks) ("Reuters Page USPRIME1") as such bank's prime rate or base lending rate as of 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date. If fewer than four such rates so appear on the Reuters Page USPRIME1 for such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Prime Rate shall be the arithmetic mean calculated by the Calculation Agent of the prime rates or base lending rates quoted on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by a 360-day year as of the close of business on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date by three major banks (which may include affiliates of the Agents) in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent; that if the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Prime Rate determined as of such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date will be the Prime Rate in effect on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date.
provided, however,
"Reuters Page USPRIME1" means the display on the Reuters 3000 Xtra Service (or any successor service) on the "USPRIME1 Page" (or such other page as may replace the USPRIME1 Page on such service) for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major U.S. banks.
Determination of the CD Rate
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof with respect to any Interest Period is the CD Rate, this Note is a "CD Rate Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to this Note for any Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period shall be the CD Rate as adjusted by the Spread and/or the Spread Multiplier, as specified on the face hereof, as determined on the applicable CD Rate Interest Determination Date. CD Rate Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any.
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," "CD Rate" means, with respect to any CD Rate Interest Determination Date, the rate on that date for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as published in H.15(519), under the heading "CDs (Secondary Market)." If the CD Rate cannot be determined in this manner, the following procedures will apply:
(1) If the rate described above is not published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the relevant Calculation Date, then the CD Rate will be the rate on that CD Rate Interest Determination Date for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit having the specified Index Maturity as published in H.15 Daily Update, or other recognized electronic sources used for the purpose of displaying the applicable rate, under the caption "CDs (Secondary Market)."
(2) If by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the applicable Calculation Date, that rate is not published in either H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source, the CD Rate for that CD Rate Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on that CD Rate Interest Determination Date, of three leading non-bank dealers in negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit in New York City, which may
 
include one or more of the Agents or their affiliates, selected by the Calculation Agent, after consultation with us, for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit of major U.S. money market banks for negotiable certificates of deposit with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time.
(3) If the dealer(s) selected as described above by the Calculation Agent are not quoting rates as set forth above, the CD Rate for that CD interest rate determination date will be the CD Rate in effect for the immediately preceding interest reset period, or if there was no interest reset period, then the rate of interest payable will be the Initial Interest Rate.
Determination of Treasury Rate
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof with respect to any Interest Period is the Treasury Rate, this Note is a "Treasury Rate Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to this Note for any Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period shall be the Treasury Rate as adjusted by the Spread and/or the Spread Multiplier, if any, as specified on the face hereof, as determined on the applicable Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date. Treasury Rate Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any.
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date, the rate from the auction held on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date (the "Auction") of direct obligations of the United States ("Treasury Bills") having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof under the caption "INVEST RATE" on the display on Reuters page USAUCTION10 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) or page USAUCTION11 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) or, if not so published at 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, the Bond Equivalent Yield (as defined below) of the rate for such Treasury Bills as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Bills/Auction High." If such rate is not so published in the related H.15 Daily Update or another recognized source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, the Treasury Rate on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the Auction rate of such Treasury Bills as announced by the United States Department of the Treasury. In the event that such Auction rate is not so announced by the United States Department of the Treasury on such Calculation Date, or if no such Auction is held, then the Treasury Rate on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the rate on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date of Treasury Bills having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as published in H.15(519) under the caption "U.S. government securities/treasury bills/secondary market" or, if not yet published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, the rate on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date of such Treasury Bills as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "U.S. government securities/treasury bills (secondary market)." If such rate is not yet published in the H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Treasury Rate on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid rates, as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date, of the three leading primary United States government securities dealers (which may include the Agents or their affiliates) selected by the Calculation Agent, for the issue of Treasury Bills with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof; that if the dealers so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Treasury Rate determined as of such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date will be the Treasury Rate in effect on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date.
provided, however,
 
The "Bond Equivalent Yield" means a yield (expressed as a percentage) calculated in accordance with the following formula:
 
where "D" refers to the applicable per annum rate for Treasury Bills quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal, "N" refers to 365 or 366, as the case may be, and "M" refers to the actual number of days in the applicable Interest Reset Period.
Determination of CMT Rate
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof with respect to any Interest Period is the CMT Rate, this Note is a "CMT Rate Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to this Note for any Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period shall be the CMT Rate as adjusted by the Spread and/or the Spread Multiplier, if any, as specified on the face hereof, as determined on the applicable CMT Rate Interest Determination Date. CMT Rate Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any.
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," with respect to any CMT Rate Interest Determination Date:
(1) If "Reuters Page FRBCMT" is the specified CMT Reuters Page on the face hereof, the CMT Rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as set forth in H.15(519) under the caption "Treasury constant maturities," as such yield is displayed on Reuters (or any successor service) on page FRBCMT (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page FRBCMT") for such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date. If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page FRBCMT, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof and for such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date as set forth in H.15(519) under the caption "Treasury constant maturities." If such rate does not appear in H.15(519), the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate for the period of the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as may then be published by either the Federal Reserve Board or the United States Department of the Treasury that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to the rate that would otherwise have been published in H.15(519). If the Federal Reserve Board or the United States Department of the Treasury does not publish a yield on United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof for such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices at approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three leading primary United States government securities dealers in New York City (which may include the Agents or their affiliates) (each, a "Reference Dealer") selected by the Calculation Agent from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity equal to the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, a remaining term to maturity no more than one year shorter than such Index Maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time. If fewer than three prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, a remaining term to maturity closest to such Index Maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time. If two such United States Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof have remaining terms to maturity
 
equally close to such Index Maturity, the quotes for the treasury security with the shorter original term to maturity will be used. If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor the lowest of such quotations shall be eliminated; that if fewer than three such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate determined as of such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the CMT Rate in effect on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date.
provided, however,
(2) If "Reuters Page FEDCMT" is the specified CMT Reuters Page on the face hereof, the CMT Rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the one-week or one-month, as specified on the face hereof, average yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as set forth in H.15(519) opposite the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," as such yield is displayed on Reuters on page FEDCMT (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page FEDCMT") for the week or month, as applicable, ended immediately preceding the week or month, as applicable, in which such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date falls. If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page FEDCMT, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the one-week or one-month, as specified on the face hereof, average yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof for the week or month, as applicable, preceding such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date as set forth in H.15(519) opposite the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities." If such rate does not appear in H.15(519), the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the one-week or one-month, as specified on the face hereof, average yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as otherwise announced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the week or month, as applicable, ended immediately preceding the week or month, as applicable, in which such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date falls. If the Federal Reserve Bank of New York does not publish a one-week or one-month, as specified on the face hereof, average yield on United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof for the applicable week or month, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices at approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity equal to the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, a remaining term to maturity of no more than one year shorter than such Index Maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time. If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date calculated by the Calculation Agent based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor the lowest of such quotation shall be eliminated. If fewer than three prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity longer than the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, a remaining term to maturity closest to such Index Maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time. If two United States Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof have remaining terms to maturity equally close to such Index Maturity, the quotes for the Treasury security with the shorter original term to maturity will be used. If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date calculated by the Calculation Agent based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor lowest of such quotations shall be eliminated; that if fewer than three such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate determined as of such CMT Rate determination date shall be the CMT Rate in effect on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date.
provided, however,
 
Redemption
If possible Redemption Dates or periods within which Redemption Dates may occur and the related Redemption Prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount of this Note) are set forth on the face hereof under "Redemption Terms", unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, this Note is subject to redemption prior to the Maturity Date upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice mailed to the Person in whose name this Note is registered at such address as shall appear in the Security Register of the Company, on any Redemption Date so specified or occurring within any period so specified, as a whole or in part, at the election of the Company, at the applicable Redemption Price so specified, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date; that installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable in the case of any such redemption to the holder of this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates referred to above, all in accordance with the terms hereof and as provided in the Indenture. If less than all of the Notes of like tenor and terms are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select the Notes to be redeemed by a method that the Trustee deems fair and appropriate. In the event of redemption of less than all of the principal of this Note, a new Note of this series and of like tenor and terms of an authorized denomination for the unredeemed portion of this Note will be issued in the name of the holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, under "Redemption Terms", this Note is not subject to any sinking fund, and the Company will not be obligated to redeem, purchase or repay this Note pursuant to a sinking fund or analogous provision or at the option of the holder.
provided, however,
Miscellaneous Provisions

In addition, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may waive all defaults and rescind a declaration of acceleration of the Notes if certain conditions are satisfied. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall impair or affect, without the consent of a holder of this Note, the right of such holder to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note on or after the respective Stated Maturities, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates against the Company.

The principal of this Note shall not bear interest except in the case of a default in payment of principal upon acceleration, upon redemption or at the Maturity Date, and in such case the overdue principal of this Note shall bear interest at a rate which is equivalent to the Yield to Maturity stated above (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), which shall accrue from the Maturity Date or the date payment is due upon acceleration or redemption, as the case may be, to the date payment of such principal has been made or duly provided for. Interest on any overdue principal shall be payable upon demand. Any such interest on any overdue principal that is not so paid on demand shall bear interest at the same rate as the interest on the overdue principal (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), which shall accrue from the date of such demand for payment to the date payment of such interest has been made or duly provided for, and such interest shall also be payable on demand. In the event that any Maturity Date is not a Business Day, the principal otherwise payable on such date will be paid on the next day that is a Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Maturity Date, and no interest will accrue for the period from and after such Maturity Date to such next following Business Day. In the event that any Redemption Date is not a Business Day, such Redemption Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, and no interest will accrue for the period from and after that Redemption Date to such next succeeding Business Day.

provided, however
The principal of and any premium and interest on this Note are payable by the Company in U.S. dollars, unless a different Specified Currency is indicated on the face hereof. If the Specified Currency for this Note is other than U.S. dollars, the Company will (unless otherwise specified on the face hereof) arrange to convert all payments in respect of this Note into U.S. dollars. If this Note has a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars, the amount of any U.S. dollar payment will be based on the bid quoted by the exchange rate agent for the purchase of U.S. dollars with the Specified Currency for settlement on the payment date and on the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to the holder of this Note scheduled to receive such payments. The bid quotation will be as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on the second day preceding the applicable payment date on which banks are open for business in London and New York City. If this bid quotation is not available, such exchange rate agent will obtain a bid quotation from a leading foreign exchange bank in London or New York City selected by such exchange rate agent. If these bids are not available, payment of the aggregate amount due to all holders on the payment date will be in the Specified Currency. All currency exchange costs will be borne by the holder of this Note by deductions from such payments due such holder.
If this Note has a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars, the holder may (if so indicated on the face hereof) elect to receive all payments in respect of this Note in the Specified Currency by delivery of a written notice to the applicable Paying Agent not later than 15 calendar days prior to the applicable payment date. That election will remain in effect until revoked by written notice to the Paying Agent received no later than 15 calendar days prior to the applicable payment date.

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of the Company's unsecured, unsurbordinated medium-term notes, Series A due nine months or more from the date of issue (herein called the "Notes"), issued or to be issued under the Indenture Regarding Senior Securities, dated as of May 24, 1996, as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 4, 2009 (as so amended, and as may be further amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association (as successor to the corporate trust business of State Street Bank and Trust Company), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture, including all indentures supplemental thereto, along with the Officers' Certificate and Company Orderthe "Officers' Certificate"), dated May 4, 2009, with respect to, among other things, the establishment of the Notes, reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes and the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. In accordance with the Indenture and Officers' Certificate, the Notes may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption and repayment provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and events of default, and may otherwise vary as therein provided or permitted. The Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of Notes that the Company may issue.
(
If possible Redemption Dates or periods within which Redemption Dates may occur and the related Redemption Prices (unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," expressed as percentages of the Amortized Face Amount of this Note) are set forth on the face hereof under "Redemption Terms", unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, this Note is subject to redemption prior to the Maturity Date upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice mailed to the Person in whose name this Note is registered at such address as shall appear in the Security Register of the Company, on any Redemption Date so specified or occurring within any period so specified, as a whole or in part, at the election of the Company, at the applicable Redemption Price so specified. If less than all of the Notes of like tenor and terms are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select the Notes to be redeemed by a method that the Trustee deems fair and appropriate. In the event of redemption of less than all of the principal of this Note, a new Note of this series and of like tenor and terms of an authorized denomination for the unredeemed portion of this Note will be issued in the name of the holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, under "Redemption Terms", this Note is not subject to any sinking fund, and the Company will not be obligated to redeem, purchase or repay this Note pursuant to a sinking fund or analogous provision or at the option of the holder.
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the events that constitute Events of Default with respect to this Note shall be as set forth in the Indenture. If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, a lesser amount than the principal amount due at the Stated Maturity may (subject to the conditions set forth in the Indenture) be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. Upon payment (i) of the amount of principal so declared due and payable and (ii) of interest on any overdue principal and overdue interest (in each case to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), all of the Company's obligations in respect of the payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on this Note shall terminate.
The amount due and payable on this Note in the event that the principal amount hereof is declared due and payable prior to the Stated Maturity hereof or in the event that this Note is redeemed shall, unless otherwise indicated on the face hereof under "Other Terms," be the Amortized Face Amount (as defined below) of this Note or, in the case of redemption, the specified percentage of the Amortized Face Amount of this Note on the date such payment is due and payable as determined by the Company, plus, in each case, any accrued but unpaid "qualified stated interest" payments (as defined in the Treasury Regulations regarding original issue discount issued by the Treasury Department (the "Regulations")).
 
The "Amortized Face Amount" of this Note shall be the amount equal to the sum of (i) the issue price (as defined below) of this Note and (ii) that portion of the difference between the issue price and the principal amount of this Note that has been amortized at the Stated Yield (as defined below) of this Note (computed in accordance with Section 1272(a)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and Section 1.1275-1(b) of the Regulations, in each case as in effect on the issue date of this Note) at the date as of which the Amortized Face Amount is calculated. In no event can the Amortized Face Amount exceed the principal amount of this Note due at the Stated Maturity hereof. As used in the preceding sentence, the term "issue price" means the principal amount of this Note due at the Stated Maturity hereof less the Original Issue Discount of this Note specified on the face hereof. The term "Stated Yield" of this Note means the Yield to Maturity specified on the face hereof for the period from the Original Issue Date of this Note specified on the face hereof, to the Stated Maturity hereof based on the issue price and stated redemption price at the maturity hereof.
The Indenture permits the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of Securities Outstanding under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected, although certain modifications cannot be made without the consent of the holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby. The Indenture also permits the Company and the Trustee to modify the Indenture in certain circumstances without the consent of the holders of any Securities at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the holders of all Notes, prior to any acceleration of the principal of the Notes, to waive any past default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences, except a default under a covenant that cannot be modified without the consent of each holder of a Note affected thereby. In addition, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may waive all defaults and rescind a declaration of acceleration of the Notes if certain conditions are satisfied. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
In determining whether the holders of the requisite principal amount of the Outstanding Notes have given any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver under the Indenture or whether a quorum is present at a meeting of holders of Notes, the principal amount of any Original Issue Discount Note that shall be deemed to be Outstanding shall be the amount of the principal thereof that would be due and payable as of the date of such determination upon acceleration of the Maturity thereof.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall impair or affect, without the consent of a holder of this Note, the right of such holder to receive payment of the principal of and any premium on this Note on or after the respective Stated Maturities, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates against the Company.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security Register of the Company, upon due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of (and premium, if any) on this Note are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by the holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of this series and of like tenor and terms and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
Unless otherwise set forth on the face hereof under "Other Terms," the Notes are issuable only in fully registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 or any amount in excess of $1,000 which is an integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations and of like tenor and terms of the same series, as requested by the holder surrendering the same.
No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered in the Security Register as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
This Note may have such additional or different terms as are set forth on the face hereof under "Other Terms" as provided for or permitted in the Indenture or the Officers' Certificate. Any terms so set forth shall be deemed to modify and/or supersede, as necessary, any other terms set forth in this Note.
This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

If possible Redemption Dates or periods within which Redemption Dates may occur and the related Redemption Prices (unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," expressed as percentages of the principal amount of this Note if this Note is an Original Issue Discount Note for federal income tax purposes only as shown on the face hereof and as percentages of the Amortized Face Amount of this Note if this Note is an Original Issue Discount Note subject to the "Special Provisions" below as shown on the face hereof) are set forth on the face hereof under "Redemption Terms", unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, this Note is subject to redemption prior to the Maturity Date upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice mailed to the Person in whose name this Note is registered at such address as shall appear in the Security Register of the Company, on any Redemption Date so specified or occurring within any period so specified, as a whole or in part, at the election of the Company, at the applicable Redemption Price so specified, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date, , that installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable in the case of any such redemption to the holder of this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates referred to on the face hereof, all in accordance with the terms hereof and as provided in the Indenture. If less than all of the Notes of like tenor and terms are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select the Notes to be redeemed by a method that the Trustee deems fair and appropriate. In the event of redemption of less than all of the principal of this Note, a new Note of this series and of like tenor and terms of an authorized denomination for the unredeemed portion of this Note will be issued in the name of the holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, under "Redemption Terms", this Note is not subject to any sinking fund, and the Company will not be obligated to redeem, purchase or repay this Note pursuant to a sinking fund or analogous provision or at the option of the holder.
provided, however
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the events that constitute Events of Default with respect to this Note shall be as set forth in the Indenture. If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, a lesser amount than the principal amount due at the Stated Maturity may (subject to the conditions set forth in the Indenture) be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. Upon payment (i) of the amount of principal so declared due and payable and (ii) of interest on any overdue principal and overdue interest (in each case to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), all of the Company's obligations in respect of the payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on this Note shall terminate.
The Indenture permits the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of Securities Outstanding under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of
 
each series to be affected, although certain modifications cannot be made without the consent of the holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby. The Indenture also permits the Company and the Trustee to modify the Indenture in certain circumstances without the consent of the holders of any Securities at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the holders of all Notes, prior to any acceleration of the principal of the Notes, to waive any past default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences, except a default under a covenant that cannot be modified without the consent of each holder of a Note affected thereby. In addition, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may waive all defaults and rescind a declaration of acceleration of the Notes if certain conditions are satisfied. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
In determining whether the holders of the requisite principal amount of the Outstanding Notes have given any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver under the Indenture or whether a quorum is present at a meeting of holders of Notes, the principal amount of any Original Issue Discount Note that shall be deemed to be Outstanding shall be the amount of the principal thereof that would be due and payable as of the date of such determination upon acceleration of the Maturity thereof.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall impair or affect, without the consent of a holder of this Note, the right of such holder to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note on or after the respective Stated Maturities, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates against the Company.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security Register of the Company, upon due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Note are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by the holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of this series and of like tenor and terms and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
Unless otherwise set forth on the face hereof under "Other Terms," the Notes are issuable only in fully registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 or any amount in excess of $1,000 which is an integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations and of like tenor and terms of the same series, as requested by the holder surrendering the same.
No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Unless otherwise indicated on the face hereof under "Other Terms," if this Note is an Original Issue Discount Fixed Rate Note subject to these Special Provisions, as indicated on the face hereof, the amount due and payable on this Note in the event that the principal amount hereof is declared due and payable prior to the Stated Maturity hereof or in the event that this Note is redeemed shall be the Amortized Face Amount (as defined below) of this Note or, in the case of redemption, the specified percentage of the Amortized Face Amount of this Note on the date such payment is due and payable as determined by the Company, plus, in each case, any accrued but unpaid "qualified stated interest" payments (as defined in the Treasury Regulations regarding original issue discount issued by the Treasury Department (the "Regulations")).
The "Amortized Face Amount" of this Note shall be the amount equal to the sum of (i) the issue price (as defined below) of this Note and (ii) that portion of the difference between the issue price and the principal amount of this Note that has been amortized at the Stated Yield (as defined below) of this Note (computed in accordance with Section 1272(a)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and Section 1.1275-1(b) of the Regulations, in each case as in effect on the issue date of this Note) at the date as of which the Amortized Face Amount is calculated. In no event can the Amortized Face Amount exceed the principal amount of this Note due at the Stated Maturity hereof.

Such definitive notes shall be registered in the name or names of such person or persons as the Depositary shall instruct the registrar.

REFERENCE IS HEREBY MADE TO THE FURTHER PROVISIONS OF SUCH MASTER GLOBAL NOTE (TOGETHER WITH THIS RIDER, HEREIN REFERRED TO AS THIS "MASTER GLOBAL NOTE") SET FORTH IN THE RECORDS OF THE ISSUER MAINTAINED BY THE TRUSTEE, WHICH RECORDS CONSIST OF THE PRICING SUPPLEMENT(S) TO THE PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT DATED APRIL 27, 2009, AND PROSPECTUS DATED JULY 25, 2008 (EACH SUCH PRICING SUPPLEMENT, AS IT MAY BE AMENDED OR SUPPLEMENTED, A "PRICING SUPPLEMENT") RELATING TO EACH ISSUANCE OF DEBT OBLIGATIONS, AS FILED BY THE ISSUER WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. SUCH FURTHER PROVISIONS SHALL FOR ALL PURPOSES HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS THOUGH FULLY SET FORTH AT THIS PLACE.
Section 1. Defined Terms.
Unless otherwise defined herein, all terms used in this Master Global Note which are defined in the Indenture or Officers' Certificate shall have the respective meanings assigned to them in the Indenture or the Officers' Certificate.
Section 2. General.
This Master Global Note is a duly authorized issue of the series of Securities of the Issuer designated herein. In accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Officers' Certificate, the Debt Obligations and other Series A Notes may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption and repayment provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase, or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and events of default, and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture or the Officers' Certificate provided or permitted. The Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of Series A Notes, including the Debt Obligations evidenced by this Master Global Note, that the Issuer may issue under this Series A.
This Master Global Note may have such additional or different terms as are set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement(s) as provided for or permitted in the Indenture or the Officers' Certificate. Any terms so set forth shall be deemed to modify and/or supersede, as necessary, any other terms set forth in this Master Global Note.
Section 3. Payments of Principal and Interest.
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Issuer shall pay the principal of each Debt Obligation, together with any premium thereon, on the Maturity date of each Debt Obligation or upon any applicable Redemption Date, and shall pay interest thereon from the original issue date of such Debt Obligation (the "Original Issue Date") or such other date specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement or, except as otherwise specified below, from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, on each applicable Interest Payment Date, commencing with the Interest Payment Date immediately following the Original Issue Date or such other date specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, at the applicable rate, until the principal of the Debt Obligation is paid or made available for payment; provided, however, that if the Original Issue Date is between a Regular Record Date and an Interest Payment Date, the initial interest payment will be made on the Interest Payment Date following the next succeeding Regular Record Date to the registered holder on such next succeeding Regular Record Date. The interest so payable and punctually paid or duly provided for on any
 
Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Master Global Note (or one or more predecessor Master Global Notes) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date related to the Interest Payment Date, which, unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, shall be the day (whether or not a Business Day) 15 calendar days preceding each Interest Payment Date; provided, however, that interest payable on the Maturity date of any Debt Obligation or any applicable Redemption Date shall be payable to the Person to whom principal shall be payable. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the holder of this Master Global Note on such Regular Record Date and may be paid in accordance with the Indenture (i) to the Person in whose name this Master Global Note (or one or more predecessor Series A Notes) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice of which shall be given to the holder of this Master Global Note not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date; or (ii) in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Series A Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by any such exchange, if such manner of payment is deemed practicable by the Trustee. In the event that any Maturity date or Redemption Date is not a Business Day, the principal otherwise payable on such date will be paid on the next day that is a Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Maturity date or Redemption Date, as applicable, and no interest will accrue for the period from and after such Maturity date or Redemption Date to such next following Business Day. In the event that any Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day and no interest will accrue for the period from and after the scheduled Interest Payment Date, provided that, for LIBOR Debt Obligations and EURIBOR Debt Obligations, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. Unless otherwise specified in an applicable Pricing Supplement, payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Master Global Note due on the Maturity date or any applicable Redemption Date will be made in immediately available funds to the Depositary or its nominee, or registered assigns, as the registered owner of this Master Global Note representing the Debt Obligations; provided, however, that the Issuer may, at its option, pay principal and any premium and interest with respect to any Registered Note by mailing a check to the address of the Person entitled to payment as it appears on the Security Register, except that a holder of this Master Global Note holding $10,000,000 (or the equivalent of $10,000,000 in a currency other than U.S. dollars) or more in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Obligations of like tenor and terms shall be entitled to receive payments by wire transfer of immediately available funds if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received in writing by the Trustee or the applicable Paying Agent not later than ten Business Days prior to the applicable payment date.
The principal of and any premium and interest on the Debt Obligations under this Master Global Note are payable by the Issuer in U.S. dollars, unless the applicable Pricing Supplement specifies otherwise. If the specified currency is other than U.S. dollars, the Issuer will (unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement) arrange to convert all payments in respect of the applicable Debt Obligations under this Master Global Note into U.S. dollars. The amount of any U.S. dollar payment in respect of a Debt Obligation having a specified currency other than U.S. dollars will be based on the bid quoted by the exchange rate agent for the purchase of U.S. dollars with the specified currency for settlement on the payment date and on the aggregate amount of the specified currency payable to the holder of this Master Global Note scheduled to receive such payments. The bid quotation will be as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on the second day preceding the applicable payment date on which banks are open for business in London and New York City. If this bid quotation is not available, such exchange rate agent will obtain a bid quotation from a leading foreign exchange bank in London or New York City selected by such exchange rate agent. If these bids are not available, payment of the aggregate amount due to the holder on the payment date will be in the specified currency. All currency exchange costs will be borne by the holder of this Master Global Note by deductions from such payments due such holder.
If the specified currency is other than U.S. dollars, the holder may (if so indicated in the applicable Pricing Supplement) elect to receive all payments in respect of applicable Debt Obligations under this Master Global Note in the specified currency by delivery of a written notice to the applicable Paying Agent not later than fifteen calendar days prior to the applicable payment date. That election will remain in effect until revoked by written notice to the Paying Agent received no later than fifteen calendar days prior to the applicable payment date.
 
Section 4. Redemption.
If possible Redemption Dates or periods within which Redemption Dates may occur and the related Redemption Prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount of the applicable Debt Obligations) are set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement, unless the applicable Pricing Supplement specifies otherwise, such Debt Obligations are subject to redemption prior to the Maturity date upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice mailed to the Person in whose name this Master Global Note is registered at such address as shall appear in the Security Register of the Issuer, on any Redemption Date so specified or occurring within any period so specified, as a whole or in part, at the election of the Issuer, at the applicable Redemption Price so specified, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date, provided, however, that installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable in the case of any such redemption to the holder of this Master Global Note (or one or more predecessor Series A Notes) at the close of business on the relevant record dates referred to above, all in accordance with the terms hereof and as provided in the Indenture. If less than all of the Debt Obligations with similar terms are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select the Debt Obligations to be redeemed by a method that the Trustee deems fair and appropriate. Unless the applicable Pricing Supplement specifies otherwise, the Issuer will not be obligated to redeem, purchase or repay Debt Obligations at the option of the holder.

For the purpose of determining whether holders of the requisite amount of the Series A Notes, including the Debt Obligations as evidenced by this Master Global Note, outstanding under the Indenture have made a demand, given a notice or waiver or taken any other action, the outstanding principal amount of this Master Global Note shall be deemed to be the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Debt Obligations as evidenced by this Master Global Note.
Section 7. Modification and Waivers.
The Indenture permits the modification of the rights and obligations of the Issuer and the rights of the holders of Securities Outstanding under the Indenture at any time by the Issuer and the Trustee with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected, although certain modifications cannot be made without the consent of the holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby. The Indenture also permits the Issuer and the Trustee to modify the Indenture in certain circumstances without the consent of the holders of any Securities at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Series A Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the holders of all Series A Notes, prior to any acceleration of the principal of such Series A Notes, to waive any past default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences, except a default under a covenant that cannot be modified without the consent of each holder of a Series A Note affected thereby. In addition, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Series A Notes may waive all defaults and rescind a declaration of acceleration of the Series A Notes if certain conditions are satisfied. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Master Global Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Master Global Note and of any Master Global Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Master Global Note.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Master Global Note or of the Indenture shall impair or affect, without the consent of a holder of this Master Global Note, the right of such holder to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and interest on each Debt Obligation on or after the respective Stated Maturities, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates against the Issuer.
 
Section 8. Authorized Form and Denominations.
Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Debt Obligations are issuable only in fully registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 or any amount in excess of $1,000 which is an integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Debt Obligations are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Debt Obligations of other authorized denominations and of like tenor and terms of the same series, as requested by the holder surrendering the same.
No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer, the Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Master Global Note is registered in the Security Register as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Master Global Note be overdue, and neither the Issuer, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Section 9. Registration of Transfer.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Master Global Note is registrable in the Security Register of the Issuer, upon due presentment of this Master Global Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Issuer in any place where the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Master Global Note are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Issuer and the Trustee duly executed by, the holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Master Global Notes of this series and of like tenor and terms and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

In the event that any Maturity Date or Redemption Date is not a Business Day, the principal otherwise payable on such date will be paid on the next day that is a Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Maturity Date or Redemption Date, as applicable, and no interest will accrue for the period from and after such Maturity Date or Redemption Date to such next following Business Day.

If the Specified Currency for this Note is other than U.S. dollars, the Company will (unless otherwise specified on the face hereof) arrange to convert all payments in respect of this Note into U.S. dollars. If this Note has a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars, the amount of any U.S. dollar payment will be based on the bid quoted by the exchange rate agent for the purchase of U.S. dollars with the Specified Currency for settlement on the payment date and on the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to the holder of this Note scheduled to receive such payments. The bid quotation will be as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on the second day preceding the applicable payment date on which banks are open for business in London and New York City. If this bid quotation is not available, such exchange rate agent will obtain a bid quotation from a leading foreign exchange bank in London or New York City selected by such exchange rate agent. If these bids are not available, payment of the aggregate amount due to all holders on the payment date will be in the Specified Currency.

That election will remain in effect until revoked by written notice to the Paying Agent received no later than 15 calendar days prior to the applicable payment date.

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of the Company's unsecured, subordinated medium-term notes, Series B due nine months or more from the date of issue (herein called the "Notes"), issued or to be issued under the Indenture Regarding Subordinated Securities dated as of May 24, 1996, as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 23, 2003, by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 24, 2004 and by the Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 4, 2009 (as so amended, and as may be further amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association (as successor to the corporate trust business of State Street Bank and Trust Company), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture, including all indentures supplemental thereto, along with the Officers' Certificate and Company Order (the "Officers' Certificate"), dated May 4, 2009, with respect to, among other things, the establishment of the Notes, reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee, the Holders of Senior Indebtedness and the holders of the Notes and the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. In accordance with the Indenture and Officers' Certificate, the Notes may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption and repayment provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and events of default, and may otherwise vary as therein provided or permitted. The Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of Notes that the Company may issue.
If possible Redemption Dates or periods within which Redemption Dates may occur and the related Redemption Prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount of this Note) are set forth on the face hereof under "Redemption Terms", unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, this Note is subject to redemption prior to the Maturity Date upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice mailed to the Person in whose name this Note is registered at such address as shall appear in the Security Register of the Company, on any Redemption Date so specified or occurring within any period so specified, as a whole or in part, at the election of the Company, at the applicable Redemption Price so specified, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date, , that installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable in the case of any such redemption to the holder of this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates referred to on the face hereof, all in accordance with the terms hereof and as provided in the Indenture. If less than all of the Notes of like tenor and terms are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select the Notes to be redeemed by a method that the Trustee deems fair and appropriate. In the event of redemption of less than all of the principal of this Note, a new Note of this series and of like tenor and terms of an authorized denomination for the unredeemed portion of this Note will be issued in the name of the holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, under "Redemption Terms", this Note is not subject to any sinking fund, and the Company will not be obligated to redeem, purchase or repay this Note pursuant to a sinking fund or analogous provision or at the option of the holder.
provided, however
The Company's obligation to make any payment of principal, premium or interest on the indebtedness evidenced by the Notes, including this Note, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Indenture referred to above, is subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the principal of and any premium and interest due on all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, as defined in the Indenture. As more specifically provided in the Indenture, upon any distribution of assets of the Company after any dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization, the holders of Senior Indebtedness are entitled to receive payment in full of principal and any premium and interest due on Senior Indebtedness before the holders of the Notes, including the holder of this Note, are entitled to receive any payment on account of the principal of and any premium or interest on such Notes (except that a holder of a Note may receive payment in shares of stock in a reorganization or adjustment in certain circumstances specified in the Indenture). Certain dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization events specified in the Indenture will not be deemed to be a dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization for this purpose. The Company may not pay principal of, or any premium or interest on, the Notes and may not acquire any Notes for cash or property other than the Company's capital stock if (1) a default on Senior Indebtedness occurs and is continuing that permits holders of such Senior Indebtedness to accelerate its maturity;
 
and (2) such default is the subject of judicial proceedings or the Company receives written notice of such default from a representative of the holders of the Senior Indebtedness. If the Company receives a notice in accordance with the preceding sentence, a similar notice received within 360 days thereafter relating to the same default on the same issue of Senior Indebtedness shall not be effective for such purpose. The Company may resume payments on the Notes, including this Note, and may acquire them when (1) such default is cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist or the Senior Indebtedness to which such default relates shall have been paid in full in cash or cash equivalents; or (2) if such default is not the subject of judicial proceedings, 120 days pass after the Company receives such written notice (subject to any other prohibitions in the Indenture on such payment or acquisition).
Each holder of indebtedness evidenced by this Note, by accepting the same, agrees to and shall be bound by the subordination provisions of the Indenture, including those summarized herein, and authorizes and expressly directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination of such indebtedness and this Note and appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes as provided in the Indenture.
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the events that constitute Events of Default with respect to this Note shall be as set forth in the Indenture. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the events that constitute Acceleration Events with respect to this Note shall be as set forth in the Indenture. If an Acceleration Event with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of all the Notes may (subject to the conditions set forth in the Indenture) be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of Securities Outstanding under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected, although certain modifications cannot be made without the consent of the holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby. The Indenture also permits the Company and the Trustee to modify the Indenture in certain circumstances without the consent of the holders of any Securities at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the holders of all Notes, prior to any acceleration of the principal of the Notes, to waive any past default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences, except a default under a covenant that cannot be modified without the consent of each holder of a Note affected thereby. In addition, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may waive all defaults and rescind a declaration of acceleration of the Notes if certain conditions are satisfied. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
Subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company set forth in this Note and as provided in the Indenture referred to above, no reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall impair, as between the Company and a holder of this Note, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed or shall affect the relative rights of the holders of the Notes and creditors of the Company other than the holders of the Senior Indebtedness or shall prevent the Trustee or a holder of this Note from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under the Indenture. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall impair or affect, without the consent of a holder of this Note, the right of such holder to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note on or after the respective Stated Maturities, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates against the Company.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security Register of the Company, upon due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Note are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by the holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and
 
thereupon one or more new Notes of this series and of like tenor and terms and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
Unless otherwise set forth on the face hereof under "Other Terms," the Notes are issuable only in fully registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 or any amount in excess of $1,000 which is an integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations and of like tenor and terms of the same series, as requested by the holder surrendering the same.
No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered in the Security Register as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
This Note may have such additional or different terms as are set forth on the face hereof under "Other Terms" as provided for or permitted in the Indenture or the Officers' Certificate. Any terms so set forth shall be deemed to modify and/or supersede, as necessary, any other terms set forth in this Note.
This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
Unless otherwise defined herein, all terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture or Officers' Certificate shall have the respective meanings assigned to them in the Indenture or Officers' Certificate.

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of the Company's unsecured, subordinated medium-term notes, Series B due nine months or more from the date of issue (herein called the "Notes"), issued or to be issued under the Indenture Regarding Subordinated Securities, dated as of May 24, 1996, as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 23, 2003, by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 24, 2004 and by the Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 4, 2009 (as so amended, and as may be further amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association (as successor to the corporate trust business of State Street Bank and Trust Company), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture, including all indentures supplemental thereto, along with the Officers' Certificate and Company Order (the "Officers' Certificate"), dated May 4, 2009, with respect to, among other things, the establishment of the Notes, reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee, the Holders of Senior Indebtedness and the holders of the Notes and the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. In accordance with the Indenture and Officers' Certificate, the Notes may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption and repayment provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and events of default, and may otherwise vary as therein provided or permitted. The Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of Notes that the Company may issue.
General
The rate of interest for this Note will be determined by reference to one or more Base Rates specified on the face hereof, which may be adjusted by a Spread and/or Spread Multiplier. The "Spread" is the number of basis points, each one-hundredth of a percentage point, specified on the face hereof to be added or subtracted from the Base Rate specified on the face hereof. The "Spread Multiplier" is the percentage specified on the face hereof to be applied to the Base Rate specified on the face hereof. This Note may also have either or both of the following: (i) a Maximum Interest Rate, or ceiling, on the rate at which interest will accrue during any Interest Reset Period; and (ii) a Minimum Interest Rate, or floor, on the rate at which interest will accrue during any Interest Reset Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate per annum hereon shall not be greater than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or less than the Minimum Interest Rate, if any, specified on the face hereof. The interest rate on this Note will in no event exceed the maximum rate permitted by New York law as the same may be modified by United States law of general application. Under present New York law, the maximum rate of interest is (on a simple interest basis) 16% for a loan of less than $250,000, 25% for a loan of at least $250,000 but less than $2,500,000, and unlimited for a loan of $2,500,000 or more.
Commencing with the Interest Reset Date specified on the face hereof, first following the Original Issue Date specified on the face hereof, the rate at which this Note bears interest will be reset daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually (such specified period, an "Interest Reset Period," and the date on which each such reset occurs, an "Interest Reset Date"). Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," the Interest Reset Date will be as follows: in the case of Notes which are reset daily, each Business Day; in the case of Notes (other than Treasury Rate Notes) which are reset weekly, the Wednesday of each week; in the case of Treasury Rate Notes which are reset weekly, the Tuesday of each week (except if the auction date falls on a Tuesday, then the next Business Day, as provided below); in the case of Notes which are reset monthly, the third Wednesday of each month; in the case of Notes which are reset quarterly, the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December of each year; in the case of Notes which are reset semi-annually, the third Wednesday of the two months of each year as indicated on the face hereof, by the Interest Reset Dates; and in the case of Notes which are reset annually, the third Wednesday of the month of each year as indicated on the face hereof, by the Interest Reset Dates. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the interest rate determined with respect to any Interest Determination Date (as defined below) will become effective on the next succeeding Interest Reset Date; , that the interest rate in effect from the Original Issue Date to the first Interest Reset Date with respect to this Note (the "Initial Interest Rate") will be as set forth on the face hereof. If any Interest Reset Date for
provided, however
 
any Note would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, provided that, for LIBOR Notes and EURIBOR Notes, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. Subject to applicable provisions of law and except as specified herein, on each Interest Reset Date the rate of interest on this Note shall be the rate determined in accordance with the provisions of the applicable heading below.
As used herein, "Interest Determination Date" is the date that the Calculation Agent will refer to when determining the new interest rate at which the interest rate on a Floating Rate Note will reset and is the date as of which the interest rate for this Note is to be calculated, to be effective as of the following Interest Reset Date and calculated on the related Calculation Date (as defined below). Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," the Interest Determination Date pertaining to an Interest Reset Date: for a Commercial Paper Rate Note, a CD Rate Note, or a CMT Rate Note (the "Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date", the "CD Rate Interest Determination Date", and the "CMT Rate Interest Determination Date", respectively) will be the second Business Day before the Interest Reset Date; for Federal Funds Rate Notes and Prime Rate Notes will be the Business Day immediately preceding the related Interest Reset Date (the "Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date" and the "Prime Rate Interest Determination Date", respectively); for EURIBOR Notes will be the second TARGET Business Day before the Interest Reset Date (the "EURIBOR Interest Determination Date"); for LIBOR Notes will be the second London Business Day before the Interest Reset Date (the "LIBOR Interest Determination Date"); and for a Treasury Rate Note (the "Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date") will be the Business Day (other than the Interest Reset Date) on which Treasury Bills would normally be auctioned in the week in which such Interest Reset Date falls. Treasury Bills are usually sold at auction on Monday of each week, unless that day is a legal holiday, in which case the auction is usually held on the following Tuesday, although it may be held on the preceding Friday. If, as the result of a legal holiday, an auction is so held on the preceding Friday, that Friday will be the Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date pertaining to the Interest Reset Date occurring in the next week. If an auction falls on a day that is an Interest Reset Date for a Treasury Rate Note, the Interest Reset Date will be the following Business Day. The Interest Determination Date for a Floating Rate Note, which interest rate is determined by two or more Base Rates, will be the latest Business Day which is at least two Business Days prior to the Interest Reset Date for such Floating Rate Note on which each such Base Rate can be determined.
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," interest payments on this Note on an Interest Payment Date will accrue from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date on which interest is paid or duly provided for, or if no interest is paid or duly provided for, the date will be from and including the Original Issue Date or any other date specified on the face hereof on which interest begins to accrue. Interest will accrue to, but excluding, the next Interest Payment Date, or if earlier, the date on which the principal is paid or duly made available for payment. Accrued interest is calculated by multiplying the face amount of this Note by the applicable accrued interest factor (the "Accrued Interest Factor"). This Accrued Interest Factor is the sum of the interest factors calculated for each day from the Original Issue Date or any other date specified on the face hereof from which interest begins to accrue, or from the last date on which interest has been paid or duly provided for, to, but excluding the date for which accrued interest is being calculated. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the interest factor for each such day is computed by dividing the annual interest rate, expressed as a decimal, applicable to that day by 360 in the case of Commercial Paper Rate Notes, Federal Funds Rate Notes, LIBOR Notes, EURIBOR Notes, Prime Rate Notes, and CD Rate Notes, or by the actual number of days in the year in the case of Treasury Rate Notes and CMT Rate Notes. The interest rate in effect on each day will be (i) if the day is an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate for the Interest Determination Date related to the Interest Reset Date or (ii) if the day is not an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate for the Interest Determination Date related to the next preceding Interest Reset Date, subject in either case to the Maximum Interest Rate or Minimum Interest Rate referred to on the face hereof.
On or before each Calculation Date (as defined below), U.S. Bank National Association, as Calculation Agent (the "Calculation Agent"), will determine the interest rate in accordance with the foregoing with respect to the applicable Base Rate and will notify the Company and the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will determine the Accrued Interest Factor applicable to this Note. The Paying Agent will, upon the request of the holder of this Note, provide the interest rate then in effect and the interest rate which will become effective as a result of a determination made with respect to the most recent Interest Determination Date with respect to this Note. The determinations of interest rates made by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding, and neither the Trustee nor the Paying Agent shall have the duty to verify determinations of interest rates made by the
 
Calculation Agent. The determinations of Accrued Interest Factors made by the Paying Agent shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," the "Calculation Date" means the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day after such Interest Determination Date, or, if that day is not a Business Day, the following Business Day, and (ii) the Business Day before the applicable Interest Payment Date, Maturity Date or Redemption Date, as the case may be.
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," all percentages resulting from any calculation on this Note, will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward. For example, 9.876545% (or .09876545) will be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655) and 9.876544% (or .09876544) will be rounded to 9.87654% (or .0987654). All calculations of the Accrued Interest Factor for any day on the Notes will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-millionth, with five one-billionths rounded upward (e.g., .098765455 will be rounded to .09876546 and .098765454 will be rounded to ..09876545). All dollar amounts used in or resulting from any calculation on this Note will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward.
Determination of Commercial Paper Rate
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof with respect to any Interest Period is the Commercial Paper Rate, this Note is a "Commercial Paper Rate Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to this Note for any Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period shall be the Commercial Paper Rate as adjusted by the Spread and/or the Spread Multiplier, if any, as specified on the face hereof, as determined on the applicable Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date. Commercial Paper Rate Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any.
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," "Commercial Paper Rate" means, with respect to any Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date, the Money Market Yield (calculated as described below) of the rate on that date for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as published in "Statistical Release H.15(519), Selected Interest Rates" or any successor publication of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("H.15 (519)") under the heading "Commercial Paper  Nonfinancial."
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the following procedures will be followed if the Commercial Paper Rate cannot be determined as described above:
(1) If the rate is not published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date relating to the Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date, then the Commercial Paper Rate will be the Money Market Yield of the rate on the Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as set forth in the daily update of H.15(519), available through the worldwide website of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/update, or any successor site or publication (the "H.15 Daily Update") under the heading "Commercial Paper  Nonfinancial."
(2) If by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date the rate is not published in either H.15(519) or the H.15 Daily Update, then the Calculation Agent shall determine the Commercial Paper Rate to be the Money Market Yield of the arithmetic mean of the offered rates as of 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date, of three leading dealers of commercial paper in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent, after consultation with the Company, for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof placed for an industrial issuer whose bond rating is "AA," or the equivalent, from a nationally recognized statistical rating agency; , that if the dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as described above in this sentence, the Commercial Paper Rate in effect immediately before the Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date will not change and will remain the Commercial Paper Rate in effect on the Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date.
provided, however
 
"Money Market Yield" shall be a yield calculated in accordance with the following formula:
 
where "D" refers to the applicable per annum rate for the commercial paper, quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal, and "M" refers to the actual number of days in the Interest Period for which the interest is being calculated.
Determination of Federal Funds Rate
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof with respect to any Interest Period is the Federal Funds Rate, this Note is a "Federal Funds Rate Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to this Note for any Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period shall be the Federal Funds Rate as adjusted by the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any, as specified on the face hereof, as determined on the applicable Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date. Federal Funds Rate Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any. The Federal Funds Rate will be calculated by reference to either the Federal Funds (Effective) Rate, the Federal Funds Open Rate or the Federal Funds Target Rate, as specified on the face hereof.
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," "Federal Funds Rate" means the rate determined by the Calculation Agent, with respect to any Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date, in accordance with the following provisions:
(1) If "Federal Funds (Effective) Rate" is the specified Federal Funds Rate on the face hereof, the Federal Funds Rate as of the applicable Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate with respect to such date for United States dollar federal funds as published in H.15(519) opposite the caption "Federal Funds (Effective)," as such rate is displayed on Reuters on page FEDFUNDS1 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page FEDFUNDS1") under the heading "EFFECT," or, if such rate is not so published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the rate with respect to such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date for United States dollar federal funds as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "Federal funds (effective)." If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page FEDFUNDS1 or is not yet published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Federal Funds Rate with respect to such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight United States dollar federal funds arranged by three leading brokers of U.S. dollar federal funds transactions in New York City (which may include the Agents or their affiliates) selected by the Calculation Agent, prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date; that if the brokers so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Federal Funds Rate determined as of such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date will be the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date.
provided, however,
(2) If "Federal Funds Open Rate" is the specified Federal Funds Rate on the face hereof, the Federal Funds Rate as of the applicable Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate on such date under the heading "Federal Funds" for the relevant Index Maturity and opposite the caption "Open" as such rate is displayed on Reuters on page 5 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page 5"), or, if such rate does not appear on Reuters Page 5 by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the Federal Funds Rate for the Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date will be the rate for that day displayed on FFPREBON Index page on Bloomberg L.P. ("Bloomberg"), which is the Fed Funds Opening Rate as reported by Prebon Yamane (or a successor) on Bloomberg. If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page 5 or is not displayed on FFPREBON Index page on Bloomberg or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Federal Funds Rate on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight United States dollar federal funds arranged by three leading brokers of United States dollar federal funds transactions in New York City (which may include the Agents or their affiliates) selected by the
 
Calculation Agent prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date; that if the brokers so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Federal Funds Rate determined as of such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date will be the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date.
provided, however,
(3) If "Federal Funds Target Rate" is the specified Federal Funds Rate on the face hereof, the Federal Funds Rate as of the applicable Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate on such date as displayed on the FDTR Index page on Bloomberg. If such rate does not appear on the FDTR Index page on Bloomberg by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the Federal Funds Rate for such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date will be the rate for that day appearing on Reuters Page USFFTARGET= (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page USFFTARGET="). If such rate does not appear on the FDTR Index page on Bloomberg or is not displayed on Reuters Page USFFTARGET= by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Federal Funds Rate on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight United States dollar federal funds arranged by three leading brokers of United States dollar federal funds transactions in New York City (which may include the Agents or their affiliates) selected by the Calculation Agent prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date.
Determination of LIBOR
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof with respect to any Interest Period is LIBOR, this Note is a "LIBOR Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to this Note for any Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period shall be LIBOR as adjusted by the Spread and/or the Spread Multiplier, if any, as specified on the face hereof, as determined on the applicable LIBOR Interest Determination Date. LIBOR Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any.
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," "LIBOR" will be determined by the Calculation Agent with respect to each LIBOR Interest Determination Date in accordance with the following provisions:
(1) With respect to a LIBOR Interest Determination Date, LIBOR will be the rate for deposits in the Designated LIBOR Currency having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as such rate is displayed on Reuters on page LIBOR01 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service for the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks for the Designated LIBOR Currency) ("Reuters Page LIBOR01") as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date. If no such rate so appears, LIBOR on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be determined in accordance with the provisions described in clause (2) below.
(2) With respect to a LIBOR Interest Determination Date on which no rate is displayed on Reuters Page LIBOR01 as specified in clause (1) above, the Calculation Agent shall request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks (which may include affiliates of the Agents) in the London interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in the Designated LIBOR Currency for the period of the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, commencing on the related Interest Reset Date, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in the Designated LIBOR Currency in such market at such time. If at least two such quotations are so provided, then LIBOR on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean calculated by the Calculation Agent of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, then LIBOR on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean calculated by the Calculation Agent of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., in the applicable Principal Financial Center (as defined below), on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date by three major banks (which may include affiliates of the Agents) in such Principal Financial Center selected by the Calculation Agent for loans in the Designated LIBOR Currency to leading European banks, having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in the Designated LIBOR Currency in such market at such time; that if the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence,
provided, however,
 
LIBOR determined as of such LIBOR Interest Determination Date shall be LIBOR in effect on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date.

EURIBOR Rate Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any.
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," EURIBOR means, with respect to any EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, a base rate equal to the interest rate for deposits in euro designated as "EURIBOR" and sponsored jointly by the European Banking Federation and ACI  the Financial Market Association, or any company established by the joint sponsors for purposes of compiling and publishing that rate. EURIBOR will be determined in the following manner:
(1) EURIBOR will be the offered rate for deposits in euro having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, beginning on the second euro Business Day after such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, as that rate appears on Reuters Page EURIBOR 01 as of 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date.
(2) If the rate described above does not appear on Reuters Page EURIBOR 01, EURIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates, at approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, at which deposits of the following kind are offered to prime banks in the euro-zone interbank market by the principal euro-zone office of each of four major banks in that market selected by the Calculation Agent: euro deposits having such EURIBOR Index Maturity, beginning on such EURIBOR Interest Reset Date, and in a representative amount. The Calculation Agent will request that the principal euro-zone office of each of these banks provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two quotations are provided, EURIBOR for such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations.
(3) If fewer than two quotations are provided as described above, EURIBOR for such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for loans of the following kind to leading euro-zone banks quoted, at approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time on that EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, by three major banks in the euro-zone selected by the Calculation Agent: loans of euro having such EURIBOR Index Maturity, beginning on such EURIBOR Interest Reset Date, and in an amount that is representative of a single transaction in euro in that market at the time.
(4) If fewer than three banks selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as described above, EURIBOR for the new Interest Period will be EURIBOR in effect for the prior Interest Period. If the initial Base Rate has been in effect for the prior Interest Period, however, it will remain in effect for the new Interest Period.
Determination of Prime Rate
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof with respect to any Interest Period is the Prime Rate, this Note is a "Prime Rate Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to this Note for any
 
Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period shall be the Prime Rate as adjusted by the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any, as specified on the face hereof, as determined on the applicable Prime Rate Interest Determination Date.

If such rate is not yet published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update, or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Prime Rate shall be the arithmetic mean calculated by the Calculation Agent of the rates of interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on Reuters on page USPRIME1 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major United States banks) ("Reuters Page USPRIME1") as such bank's prime rate or base lending rate as of 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date. If fewer than four such rates so appear on the Reuters Page USPRIME1 for such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Prime Rate shall be the arithmetic mean calculated by the Calculation Agent of the prime rates or base lending rates quoted on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by a 360-day year as of the close of business on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date by three major banks (which may include affiliates of the Agents) in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent; that if the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Prime Rate determined as of such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date will be the Prime Rate in effect on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date.
provided, however,
"Reuters Page USPRIME1" means the display on the Reuters 3000 Xtra Service (or any successor service) on the "USPRIME1 Page" (or such other page as may replace the USPRIME1 Page on such service) for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major U.S. banks.

If the CD Rate cannot be determined in this manner, the following procedures will apply:
(1) If the rate described above is not published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the relevant Calculation Date, then the CD Rate will be the rate on that CD Rate Interest Determination Date for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit having the specified Index Maturity as published in H.15 Daily Update, or other recognized electronic sources used for the purpose of displaying the applicable rate, under the caption "CDs (Secondary Market)."
(2) If by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the applicable Calculation Date, that rate is not published in either H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source, the CD Rate for that CD Rate Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on that CD Rate Interest Determination Date, of three leading non-bank dealers in negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit in New York City, which may include one or more of the Agents or their affiliates, selected by the Calculation Agent, after consultation with us, for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit of major U.S. money market banks for negotiable certificates of deposit with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time.
 
(3) If the dealer(s) selected as described above by the Calculation Agent are not quoting rates as set forth above, the CD Rate for that CD interest rate determination date will be the CD Rate in effect for the immediately preceding interest reset period, or if there was no interest reset period, then the rate of interest payable will be the Initial Interest Rate.

If such rate is not so published in the related H.15 Daily Update or another recognized source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, the Treasury Rate on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the Auction rate of such Treasury Bills as announced by the United States Department of the Treasury. In the event that such Auction rate is not so announced by the United States Department of the Treasury on such Calculation Date, or if no such Auction is held, then the Treasury Rate on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the rate on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date of Treasury Bills having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as published in H.15(519) under the caption "U.S. government securities/treasury bills/secondary market" or, if not yet published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, the rate on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date of such Treasury Bills as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "U.S. government securities/treasury bills (secondary market)." If such rate is not yet published in the H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Treasury Rate on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid rates, as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date, of the three leading primary United States government securities dealers (which may include the Agents or their affiliates) selected by the Calculation Agent, for the issue of Treasury Bills with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof; that if the dealers so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Treasury Rate determined as of such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date will be the Treasury Rate in effect on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date.
provided, however,
The "Bond Equivalent Yield" means a yield (expressed as a percentage) calculated in accordance with the following formula:
 
where "D" refers to the applicable per annum rate for Treasury Bills quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal, "N" refers to 365 or 366, as the case may be, and "M" refers to the actual number of days in the applicable Interest Reset Period.
 
Determination of CMT Rate
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof with respect to any Interest Period is the CMT Rate, this Note is a "CMT Rate Note" with respect to such Interest Period and the interest rate with respect to this Note for any Interest Reset Date relating to such Interest Period shall be the CMT Rate as adjusted by the Spread and/or the Spread Multiplier, if any, as specified on the face hereof, as determined on the applicable CMT Rate Interest Determination Date. CMT Rate Notes will be subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate, if any.
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," with respect to any CMT Rate Interest Determination Date:
(1) If "Reuters Page FRBCMT" is the specified CMT Reuters Page on the face hereof, the CMT Rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as set forth in H.15(519) under the caption "Treasury constant maturities," as such yield is displayed on Reuters (or any successor service) on page FRBCMT (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page FRBCMT") for such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date. If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page FRBCMT, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof and for such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date as set forth in H.15(519) under the caption "Treasury constant maturities." If such rate does not appear in H.15(519), the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate for the period of the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as may then be published by either the Federal Reserve Board or the United States Department of the Treasury that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to the rate that would otherwise have been published in H.15(519). If the Federal Reserve Board or the United States Department of the Treasury does not publish a yield on United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof for such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices at approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three leading primary United States government securities dealers in New York City (which may include the Agents or their affiliates) (each, a "Reference Dealer") selected by the Calculation Agent from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity equal to the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, a remaining term to maturity no more than one year shorter than such Index Maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time. If fewer than three prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, a remaining term to maturity closest to such Index Maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time. If two such United States Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof have remaining terms to maturity equally close to such Index Maturity, the quotes for the treasury security with the shorter original term to maturity will be used. If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor the lowest of such quotations shall be eliminated; that if fewer than three such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate determined as of such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the CMT Rate in effect on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date.
provided, however,
(2) If "Reuters Page FEDCMT" is the specified CMT Reuters Page on the face hereof, the CMT Rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the one-week or one-month, as
 
specified on the face hereof, average yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as set forth in H.15(519) opposite the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," as such yield is displayed on Reuters on page FEDCMT (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page FEDCMT") for the week or month, as applicable, ended immediately preceding the week or month, as applicable, in which such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date falls. If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page FEDCMT, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the one-week or one-month, as specified on the face hereof, average yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof for the week or month, as applicable, preceding such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date as set forth in H.15(519) opposite the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities." If such rate does not appear in H.15(519), the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the one-week or one-month, as specified on the face hereof, average yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as otherwise announced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the week or month, as applicable, ended immediately preceding the week or month, as applicable, in which such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date falls. If the Federal Reserve Bank of New York does not publish a one-week or one-month, as specified on the face hereof, average yield on United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof for the applicable week or month, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices at approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity equal to the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, a remaining term to maturity of no more than one year shorter than such Index Maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time. If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date calculated by the Calculation Agent based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor the lowest of such quotation shall be eliminated. If fewer than three prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity longer than the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, a remaining term to maturity closest to such Index Maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time. If two United States Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof have remaining terms to maturity equally close to such Index Maturity, the quotes for the Treasury security with the shorter original term to maturity will be used. If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date calculated by the Calculation Agent based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor lowest of such quotations shall be eliminated; that if fewer than three such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate determined as of such CMT Rate determination date shall be the CMT Rate in effect on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date.
provided, however,
Redemption
If possible Redemption Dates or periods within which Redemption Dates may occur and the related Redemption Prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount of this Note) are set forth on the face hereof under "Redemption Terms", unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, this Note is subject to redemption prior to the Maturity Date upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice mailed to the Person in whose name this Note is registered at such address as shall appear in the Security Register of the Company, on any Redemption Date so specified or occurring within any period so specified, as a whole or in part, at the election of the Company, at the applicable Redemption Price so specified, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date; that installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable in the case of any such redemption to the holder of this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) at the close of
provided, however,
 
business on the relevant Record Dates referred to above, all in accordance with the terms hereof and as provided in the Indenture. If less than all of the Notes of like tenor and terms are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select the Notes to be redeemed by a method that the Trustee deems fair and appropriate. In the event of redemption of less than all of the principal of this Note, a new Note of this series and of like tenor and terms of an authorized denomination for the unredeemed portion of this Note will be issued in the name of the holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, under "Redemption Terms", this Note is not subject to any sinking fund, and the Company will not be obligated to redeem, purchase or repay this Note pursuant to a sinking fund or analogous provision or at the option of the holder.
Miscellaneous Provisions
The Company's obligation to make any payment of principal, premium or interest on the indebtedness evidenced by the Notes, including this Note, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Indenture referred to above, is subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the principal of and any premium and interest due on all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, as defined in the Indenture. As more specifically provided in the Indenture, upon any distribution of assets of the Company after any dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization, the holders of Senior Indebtedness are entitled to receive payment in full of principal and any premium and interest due on Senior Indebtedness before the holders of the Notes, including the holder of this Note, are entitled to receive any payment on account of the principal of and any premium or interest on such Notes (except that a holder of a Note may receive payment in shares of stock in a reorganization or adjustment in certain circumstances specified in the Indenture). Certain dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization events specified in the Indenture will not be deemed to be a dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization for this purpose. The Company may not pay principal of, or any premium or interest on, the Notes and may not acquire any Notes for cash or property other than the Company's capital stock if (1) a default on Senior Indebtedness occurs and is continuing that permits holders of such Senior Indebtedness to accelerate its maturity; and (2) such default is the subject of judicial proceedings or the Company receives written notice of such default from a representative of the holders of the Senior Indebtedness. If the Company receives a notice in accordance with the preceding sentence, a similar notice received within 360 days thereafter relating to the same default on the same issue of Senior Indebtedness shall not be effective for such purpose. The Company may resume payments on the Notes, including this Note, and may acquire them when (1) such default is cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist or the Senior Indebtedness to which such default relates shall have been paid in full in cash or cash equivalents; or (2) if such default is not the subject of judicial proceedings, 120 days pass after the Company receives such written notice (subject to any other prohibitions in the Indenture on such payment or acquisition).
Each holder of indebtedness evidenced by this Note, by accepting the same, agrees to and shall be bound by the subordination provisions of the Indenture, including those summarized herein, and authorizes and expressly directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination of such indebtedness and this Note and appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes as provided in the Indenture.
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the events that constitute Events of Default with respect to this Note shall be as set forth in the Indenture. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the events that constitute Acceleration Events with respect to this Note shall be as set forth in the Indenture. If an Acceleration Event with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of all the Notes may (subject to the conditions set forth in the Indenture) be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of Securities Outstanding under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected, although certain modifications cannot be made without the consent of the holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby. The Indenture also permits the Company and the Trustee to modify the Indenture in certain circumstances without the consent of the holders of any Securities at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the holders of all Notes, prior to any acceleration of the principal of the Notes, to waive any past default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences, except a default under a
 
covenant that cannot be modified without the consent of each holder of a Note affected thereby. In addition, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may waive all defaults and rescind a declaration of acceleration of the Notes if certain conditions are satisfied. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
Subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company set forth in this Note and as provided in the Indenture referred to above, no reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall impair, as between the Company and a holder of this Note, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed or shall affect the relative rights of the holders of the Notes and creditors of the Company other than the holders of the Senior Indebtedness or shall prevent the Trustee or a holder of this Note from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under the Indenture. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall impair or affect, without the consent of a holder of this Note, the right of such holder to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note on or after the respective Stated Maturities, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates against the Company.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security Register of the Company, upon due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Note are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by the holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of this series and of like tenor and terms and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
Unless otherwise set forth on the face hereof under "Other Terms," the Notes are issuable only in fully registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 or any amount in excess of $1,000 which is an integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations and of like tenor and terms of the same series, as requested by the holder surrendering the same.
No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered in the Security Register as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
This Note may have such additional or different terms as are set forth on the face hereof under "Other Terms" as provided for or permitted in the Indenture or the Officers' Certificate. Any terms so set forth shall be deemed to modify and/or supersede, as necessary, any other terms set forth in this Note.
This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
Unless otherwise defined herein, all terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture or Officers' Certificate shall have the respective meanings assigned to them in the Indenture or Officers' Certificate.

FOR PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 1273 AND 1275 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, THE AMOUNT OF ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT ON THIS NOTE IS THE PERCENTAGE OF ITS PRINCIPAL AMOUNT SET FORTH ABOVE AND THE YIELD TO MATURITY IS THE PERCENTAGE SET FORTH ABOVE.
a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of North Carolina (herein called the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to or registered assigns, the principal sum of on the Maturity Date shown above.

The principal of this Note shall not bear interest except in the case of a default in payment of principal upon acceleration, upon redemption or at the Maturity Date, and in such case the overdue principal of this Note shall bear interest at a rate which is equivalent to the Yield to Maturity stated above (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), which shall accrue from the Maturity Date or the date payment is due upon acceleration or redemption, as the case may be, to the date payment of such principal has been made or duly provided for. Interest on any overdue principal shall be payable upon demand. Any such interest on any overdue principal that is not so paid on demand shall bear interest at the same rate as the interest on the overdue principal (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), which shall accrue from the date of such demand for payment to the date payment of such interest has been made or duly provided for, and such interest shall also be payable on demand. In the event that any Maturity Date is not a Business Day, the principal otherwise payable on such date will be paid on the next day that is a Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Maturity Date, and no interest will accrue for the period from and after such Maturity Date to such next following Business Day. In the event that any Redemption Date is not a Business Day, such Redemption Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, and no interest will accrue for the period from and after that Redemption Date to such next succeeding Business Day. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, payment of

provided, however
The principal of and any premium and interest on this Note are payable by the Company in U.S. dollars, unless a different Specified Currency is indicated on the face hereof. If the Specified Currency for this Note is other than U.S. dollars, the Company will (unless otherwise specified on the face hereof) arrange to convert all payments in respect of this Note into U.S. dollars. If this Note has a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars, the amount of any U.S. dollar payment will be based on the bid quoted by the exchange rate agent for the purchase of U.S. dollars with the Specified Currency for settlement on the payment date and on the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to the holder of this Note scheduled to receive such payments. The bid quotation will be as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on the second day preceding the applicable payment date on which banks are open for business in London and New York City. If this bid quotation is not available, such exchange rate agent will obtain a bid quotation from a leading foreign exchange bank in London or New York City selected by such exchange rate agent. If these bids are not available, payment of the aggregate amount due to all holders on the payment date will be in the Specified Currency. All currency exchange costs will be borne by the holder of this Note by deductions from such payments due such holder.
If this Note has a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars, the holder may (if so indicated on the face hereof) elect to receive all payments in respect of this Note in the Specified Currency by delivery of a written notice to the applicable Paying Agent not later than 15 calendar days prior to the applicable payment date. That election will remain in effect until revoked by written notice to the Paying Agent received no later than 15 calendar days prior to the applicable payment date.
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse side hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by or on behalf of the Trustee referred to below by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.
 
 
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of the Company's unsecured, subordinated medium-term notes, Series B due nine months or more from the date of issue (herein called the "Notes"), issued or to be issued under the Indenture Regarding Subordinated Securities, dated as of May 24, 1996, as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 23, 2003, by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 24, 2004 and by the Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 4, 2009 (as so amended, and as may be further amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association (as successor to the corporate trust business of State Street Bank and Trust Company), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture, including all indentures supplemental thereto, along with the Officers' Certificate and Company Order (the "Officers' Certificate"), dated May 4, 2009, with respect to, among other things, the establishment of the Notes, reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee, the Holders of Senior Indebtedness and the holders of the Notes and the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. In accordance with the Indenture and Officers' Certificate, the Notes may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption and repayment provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and events of default, and may otherwise vary as therein provided or permitted. The Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of Notes that the Company may issue.
If possible Redemption Dates or periods within which Redemption Dates may occur and the related Redemption Prices (unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," expressed as percentages of the Amortized Face Amount of this Note) are set forth on the face hereof under "Redemption Terms", unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, this Note is subject to redemption prior to the Maturity Date upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice mailed to the Person in whose name this Note is registered at such address as shall appear in the Security Register of the Company, on any Redemption Date so specified or occurring within any period so specified, as a whole or in part, at the election of the Company, at the applicable Redemption Price so specified. If less than all of the Notes of like tenor and terms are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select the Notes to be redeemed by a method that the Trustee deems fair and appropriate. In the event of redemption of less than all of the principal of this Note, a new Note of this series and of like tenor and terms of an authorized denomination for the unredeemed portion of this Note will be issued in the name of the holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, under "Redemption Terms", this Note is not subject to any sinking fund, and the Company will not be obligated to redeem, purchase or repay this Note pursuant to a sinking fund or analogous provision or at the option of the holder.
The Company's obligation to make any payment of principal, premium or interest on the indebtedness evidenced by the Notes, including this Note, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Indenture referred to above, is subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the principal of and any premium and interest due on all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, as defined in the Indenture. As more specifically provided in the Indenture, upon any distribution of assets of the Company after any dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization, the holders of Senior Indebtedness are entitled to receive payment in full of principal and any premium and interest due on Senior Indebtedness before the holders of the Notes, including the holder of this Note, are entitled to receive any payment on account of the principal of and any premium or interest on such Notes (except that a holder of a Note may receive payment in shares of stock in a reorganization or adjustment in certain circumstances specified in the Indenture). Certain dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization events specified in the Indenture will not be deemed to be a dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization for this purpose. The Company may not pay principal of, or any premium or interest on, the Notes and may not acquire any Notes for cash or property other than the Company's capital stock if (1) a default on Senior Indebtedness occurs and is continuing that permits holders of such Senior Indebtedness to accelerate its maturity; and (2) such default is the subject of judicial proceedings or the Company receives written notice of such default from a representative of the holders of the Senior Indebtedness. If the Company receives a notice in accordance with the preceding sentence, a similar notice received within 360 days thereafter relating to the same default on the
 
same issue of Senior Indebtedness shall not be effective for such purpose. The Company may resume payments on the Notes, including this Note, and may acquire them when (1) such default is cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist or the Senior Indebtedness to which such default relates shall have been paid in full in cash or cash equivalents; or (2) if such default is not the subject of judicial proceedings, 120 days pass after the Company receives such written notice (subject to any other prohibitions in the Indenture on such payment or acquisition).
Each holder of indebtedness evidenced by this Note, by accepting the same, agrees to and shall be bound by the subordination provisions of the Indenture, including those summarized herein, and authorizes and expressly directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination of such indebtedness and this Note and appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes as provided in the Indenture.
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the events that constitute Events of Default with respect to this Note shall be as set forth in the Indenture. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the events that constitute Acceleration Events with respect to this Note shall be as set forth in the Indenture. If an Acceleration Event with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, a lesser amount than the principal amount due at the Stated Maturity may (subject to the conditions set forth in the Indenture) be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. Upon payment (i) of the amount of principal so declared due and payable and (ii) of interest on any overdue principal and overdue interest (in each case to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), all of the Company's obligations in respect of the payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on this Note shall terminate.
The amount due and payable on this Note in the event that the principal amount hereof is declared due and payable prior to the Stated Maturity hereof or in the event that this Note is redeemed shall, unless otherwise indicated on the face hereof under "Other Terms," be the Amortized Face Amount (as defined below) of this Note or, in the case of redemption, the specified percentage of the Amortized Face Amount of this Note on the date such payment is due and payable as determined by the Company, plus, in each case, any accrued but unpaid "qualified stated interest" payments (as defined in the Treasury Regulations regarding original issue discount issued by the Treasury Department (the "Regulations")).
The "Amortized Face Amount" of this Note shall be the amount equal to the sum of (i) the issue price (as defined below) of this Note and (ii) that portion of the difference between the issue price and the principal amount of this Note that has been amortized at the Stated Yield (as defined below) of this Note (computed in accordance with Section 1272(a)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and Section 1.1275-1(b) of the Regulations, in each case as in effect on the issue date of this Note) at the date as of which the Amortized Face Amount is calculated. In no event can the Amortized Face Amount exceed the principal amount of this Note due at the Stated Maturity hereof. As used in the preceding sentence, the term "issue price" means the principal amount of this Note due at the Stated Maturity hereof less the Original Issue Discount of this Note specified on the face hereof. The term "Stated Yield" of this Note means the Yield to Maturity specified on the face hereof for the period from the Original Issue Date of this Note specified on the face hereof, to the Stated Maturity hereof based on the issue price and stated redemption price at the maturity hereof.
The Indenture permits the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of Securities Outstanding under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected, although certain modifications cannot be made without the consent of the holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby. The Indenture also permits the Company and the Trustee to modify the Indenture in certain circumstances without the consent of the holders of any Securities at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the holders of all Notes, prior to any acceleration of the principal of the Notes, to waive any past default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences, except a default under a covenant that cannot be modified without the consent of each holder of a Note affected thereby. In addition, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may waive all defaults and rescind a declaration of acceleration of the Notes if certain conditions are satisfied. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Note and of any
 
Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
In determining whether the holders of the requisite principal amount of the Outstanding Notes have given any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver under the Indenture or whether a quorum is present at a meeting of holders of Notes, the principal amount of any Original Issue Discount Note that shall be deemed to be Outstanding shall be the amount of the principal thereof that would be due and payable as of the date of such determination upon acceleration of the Maturity thereof.
Subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company set forth in this Note and as provided in the Indenture referred to above, no reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall impair, as between the Company and a holder of this Note, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed or shall affect the relative rights of the holders of the Notes and creditors of the Company other than the holders of the Senior Indebtedness or shall prevent the Trustee or a holder of this Note from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under the Indenture. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall impair or affect, without the consent of a holder of this Note, the right of such holder to receive payment of the principal of and any premium on this Note on or after the respective Stated Maturities, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates against the Company.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security Register of the Company, upon due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of (and premium, if any) on this Note are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by the holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of this series and of like tenor and terms and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
Unless otherwise set forth on the face hereof under "Other Terms," the Notes are issuable only in fully registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 or any amount in excess of $1,000 which is an integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations and of like tenor and terms of the same series, as requested by the holder surrendering the same.
No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

payable on the Maturity Date of this Note or any applicable Redemption Date shall be payable to the Person to whom principal shall be payable. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the holder hereof on such Regular Record Date and may be paid in accordance with the Indenture (i) to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice of which shall be given to the holder of this Note not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date; or (ii) in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by any such exchange, if such manner of payment is deemed practicable by the Trustee. In the event that any Maturity Date or Redemption Date is not a Business Day, the principal otherwise payable on such date will be paid on the next day that is a Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Maturity Date or Redemption Date, as applicable, and no interest will accrue for the period from and after such Maturity Date or Redemption Date to such next following Business Day. In the event that any Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, and no interest will accrue with respect to the payment due on such Interest Payment Date for the period from and after that Interest Payment Date to such next succeeding Business Day.

Interest on this Note shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
provided, however
The principal of and any premium and interest on this Note are payable by the Company in U.S. dollars, unless a different Specified Currency is indicated on the face hereof. If the Specified Currency for this Note is other than U.S. dollars, the Company will (unless otherwise specified on the face hereof) arrange to convert all payments in respect of this Note into U.S. dollars. If this Note has a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars, the amount of any U.S. dollar payment will be based on the bid quoted by the exchange rate agent for the purchase of U.S. dollars with the Specified Currency for settlement on the payment date and on the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to the holder of this Note scheduled to receive such payments. The bid quotation will be as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on the second day preceding the applicable payment date on which banks are open for business in London and New York City. If this bid quotation is not available, such exchange rate agent will obtain a bid quotation from a leading foreign exchange bank in London or New York City selected by such exchange rate agent. If these bids are not available, payment of the aggregate amount due to all holders on the payment date will be in the Specified Currency. All currency exchange costs will be borne by the holder of this Note by deductions from such payments due such holder.
If this Note has a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars, the holder may (if so indicated on the face hereof) elect to receive all payments in respect of this Note in the Specified Currency by delivery of a written notice to the applicable Paying Agent not later than 15 calendar days prior to the applicable payment date. That election will remain in effect until revoked by written notice to the Paying Agent received no later than fifteen calendar days prior to the applicable payment date.
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse side hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by or on behalf of the Trustee referred to below by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.
 
 
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of the Company's unsecured, subordinated medium-term notes, Series B due nine months or more from the date of issue (herein called the "Notes"), issued or to be issued under the Indenture Regarding Subordinated Securities dated as of May 24, 1996, as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 23, 2003, by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 24, 2004 and by the Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 4, 2009 (as so amended, and as may be further amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association (as successor to the corporate trust business of State Street Bank and Trust Company), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture, including all indentures supplemental thereto, along with the Officers' Certificate and Company Order (the "Officers' Certificate"), dated May 4, 2009, with respect to, among other things, the establishment of the Notes, reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee, the Holders of Senior Indebtedness and the holders of the Notes and the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. In accordance with the Indenture and Officers' Certificate, the Notes may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption and repayment provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and events of default, and may otherwise vary as therein provided or permitted. The Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of Notes that the Company may issue.
If possible Redemption Dates or periods within which Redemption Dates may occur and the related Redemption Prices (unless otherwise specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms," expressed as percentages of the principal amount of this Note if this Note is an Original Issue Discount Note for federal income tax purposes only as shown on the face hereof and as percentages of the Amortized Face Amount of this Note if this Note is an Original Issue Discount Note subject to the "Special Provisions" below as shown on the face hereof) are set forth on the face hereof under "Redemption Terms", unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, this Note is subject to redemption prior to the Maturity Date upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice mailed to the Person in whose name this Note is registered at such address as shall appear in the Security Register of the Company, on any Redemption Date so specified or occurring within any period so specified, as a whole or in part, at the election of the Company, at the applicable Redemption Price so specified, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date, , that installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable in the case of any such redemption to the holder of this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates referred to on the face hereof, all in accordance with the terms hereof and as provided in the Indenture. If less than all of the Notes of like tenor and terms are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select the Notes to be redeemed by a method that the Trustee deems fair and appropriate. In the event of redemption of less than all of the principal of this Note, a new Note of this series and of like tenor and terms of an authorized denomination for the unredeemed portion of this Note will be issued in the name of the holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, under "Redemption Terms", this Note is not subject to any sinking fund, and the Company will not be obligated to redeem, purchase or repay this Note pursuant to a sinking fund or analogous provision or at the option of the holder.
provided, however
The Company's obligation to make any payment of principal, premium or interest on the indebtedness evidenced by the Notes, including this Note, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Indenture referred to above, is subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the principal of and any premium and interest due on all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, as defined in the Indenture. As more specifically provided in the Indenture, upon any distribution of assets of the Company after any dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization, the holders of Senior Indebtedness are entitled to receive payment in full of principal and any premium and interest due on Senior Indebtedness before the holders of the Notes, including the holder of this Note, are entitled to receive any payment on account of the principal of and any premium or interest on such Notes (except that a holder of a Note may receive payment in shares of stock in a reorganization or adjustment in certain circumstances specified in the Indenture). Certain dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization events specified in the Indenture will not be deemed to be a dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization
 
for this purpose. The Company may not pay principal of, or any premium or interest on, the Notes and may not acquire any Notes for cash or property other than the Company's capital stock if (1) a default on Senior Indebtedness occurs and is continuing that permits holders of such Senior Indebtedness to accelerate its maturity; and (2) such default is the subject of judicial proceedings or the Company receives written notice of such default from a representative of the holders of the Senior Indebtedness. If the Company receives a notice in accordance with the preceding sentence, a similar notice received within 360 days thereafter relating to the same default on the same issue of Senior Indebtedness shall not be effective for such purpose. The Company may resume payments on the Notes, including this Note, and may acquire them when (1) such default is cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist or the Senior Indebtedness to which such default relates shall have been paid in full in cash or cash equivalents; or (2) if such default is not the subject of judicial proceedings, 120 days pass after the Company receives such written notice (subject to any other prohibitions in the Indenture on such payment or acquisition).
Each holder of indebtedness evidenced by this Note, by accepting the same, agrees to and shall be bound by the subordination provisions of the Indenture, including those summarized herein, and authorizes and expressly directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination of such indebtedness and this Note and appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes as provided in the Indenture.
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the events that constitute Events of Default with respect to this Note shall be as set forth in the Indenture. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the events that constitute Acceleration Events with respect to this Note shall be as set forth in the Indenture. If an Acceleration Event with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, a lesser amount than the principal amount due at the Stated Maturity may (subject to the conditions set forth in the Indenture) be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. Upon payment (i) of the amount of principal so declared due and payable and (ii) of interest on any overdue principal and overdue interest (in each case to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), all of the Company's obligations in respect of the payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on this Note shall terminate.
The Indenture permits the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of Securities Outstanding under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected, although certain modifications cannot be made without the consent of the holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby. The Indenture also permits the Company and the Trustee to modify the Indenture in certain circumstances without the consent of the holders of any Securities at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the holders of all Notes, prior to any acceleration of the principal of the Notes, to waive any past default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences, except a default under a covenant that cannot be modified without the consent of each holder of a Note affected thereby. In addition, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may waive all defaults and rescind a declaration of acceleration of the Notes if certain conditions are satisfied. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
In determining whether the holders of the requisite principal amount of the Outstanding Notes have given any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver under the Indenture or whether a quorum is present at a meeting of holders of Notes, the principal amount of any Original Issue Discount Note that shall be deemed to be Outstanding shall be the amount of the principal thereof that would be due and payable as of the date of such determination upon acceleration of the Maturity thereof.
Subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company set forth in this Note and as provided in the Indenture referred to above, no reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall impair, as between the Company and a holder of this Note, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed or shall affect the relative rights of the holders of the Notes and creditors of the Company other than the holders of the Senior Indebtedness or shall prevent the Trustee or a
 
holder of this Note from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under the Indenture. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall impair or affect, without the consent of a holder of this Note, the right of such holder to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note on or after the respective Stated Maturities, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates against the Company.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security Register of the Company, upon due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Note are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by the holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of this series and of like tenor and terms and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
Unless otherwise set forth on the face hereof under "Other Terms," the Notes are issuable only in fully registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 or any amount in excess of $1,000 which is an integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations and of like tenor and terms of the same series, as requested by the holder surrendering the same.
No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered in the Security Register as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
This Note may have such additional or different terms as are set forth on the face hereof under "Other Terms" as provided for or permitted in the Indenture or the Officers' Certificate. Any terms so set forth shall be deemed to modify and/or supersede, as necessary, any other terms set forth in this Note.
This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
Unless otherwise defined herein, all terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture or Officers' Certificate shall have the respective meanings assigned to them in the Indenture or Officers' Certificate.
Unless otherwise indicated on the face hereof under "Other Terms," if this Note is an Original Issue Discount Fixed Rate Note subject to these Special Provisions, as indicated on the face hereof, the amount due and payable on this Note in the event that the principal amount hereof is declared due and payable prior to the Stated Maturity hereof or in the event that this Note is redeemed shall be the Amortized Face Amount (as defined below) of this Note or, in the case of redemption, the specified percentage of the Amortized Face Amount of this Note on the date such payment is due and payable as determined by the Company, plus, in each case, any accrued but unpaid "qualified stated interest" payments (as defined in the Treasury Regulations regarding original issue discount issued by the Treasury Department (the "Regulations")).
The "Amortized Face Amount" of this Note shall be the amount equal to the sum of (i) the issue price (as defined below) of this Note and (ii) that portion of the difference between the issue price and the principal amount of this Note that has been amortized at the Stated Yield (as defined below) of this Note (computed in accordance with Section 1272(a)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and Section 1.1275-1(b) of the Regulations, in each case as in effect on the issue date of this Note) at the date as of which the Amortized Face Amount is calculated. In no event can the Amortized Face Amount exceed the principal amount of this Note due at the Stated Maturity hereof. As used in the preceding sentence, the term "issue price" means the principal amount of this Note
 
due at the Stated Maturity hereof less the Original Issue Discount of this Note specified on the face hereof. The term "Stated Yield" of this Note means the Yield to Maturity specified on the face hereof for the period from the Original Issue Date of this Note specified on the face hereof, to the Stated Maturity hereof based on the issue price and stated redemption price at maturity hereof.

REFERENCE IS HEREBY MADE TO THE FURTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS MASTER GLOBAL NOTE SET FORTH ON THE REVERSE HEREOF.
This Master Global Note is a valid and binding obligation of the Issuer.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Issuer has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.
 
 
 
This Master Global Note evidences certain indebtedness (the "Debt Obligations") of the Issuer, which shall form a part of the Issuer's unsecured, subordinated medium-term notes, Series B due nine months or more from the date of issue (such series being referred to as "Series B" and such notes being referred to as the "Series B Notes"), all issued or to be issued under and pursuant to an Indenture Regarding Subordinated Securities dated as of May 24, 1996, as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 23, 2003, by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 24, 2004 and by the Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 4, 2009 (as so amended, and as may be further amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Indenture"), duly executed and delivered by the Issuer to U.S. Bank National Association (as successor to the corporate trust business of State Street Bank and Trust Company), as trustee (the "Trustee"), to which Indenture, including all indentures supplemental thereto, along with the Issuer's Officers' Certificate and Company Order (the "Officers' Certificate"), dated May 4, 2009, with respect to, among other things, the establishment of the Series B Notes, reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Issuer, the Trustee, the holders of Senior Indebtedness and the holders of the Debt Obligations. In accordance with the Indenture and Officers' Certificate, the Debt Obligations and other Series B Notes may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption and repayment provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase, or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and events of default, and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture or Officers' Certificate provided or permitted. The Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of Series B Notes, including the Debt Obligations as evidenced by this Master Global Note, that the Issuer may issue under this Series B.
Capitalized terms used herein that are not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture or the Officers' Certificate.
The Issuer's obligation to make any payment of principal, premium or interest on the indebtedness evidenced by the Series B Notes, including this Master Global Note, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Indenture referred to above, is subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the principal of and any premium and interest due on all Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer, as defined in the Indenture. As more specifically provided in the Indenture, upon any distribution of assets of the Issuer after any dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization, the holders of Senior Indebtedness are entitled to receive payment in full of principal and any premium and interest due on Senior Indebtedness before the holders of the Series B Notes, including the holders of this Master Global Note and the Debt Obligations evidenced hereby, are entitled to receive any payment on account of the principal of and any premium or interest on such Series B Notes, including the Debt Obligations (except that holders of the Series B Notes, including the Debt Obligations, may receive payment in shares of stock in a reorganization or adjustment in certain circumstances specified in the Indenture). Certain dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization events specified in the Indenture will not be deemed to be a dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization for this purpose. The Issuer may not pay principal of, or any premium or interest on, the Series B Notes, including the Debt Obligations, and may not acquire any Series B Notes, including the Debt Obligations, for cash or property other than the Issuer's capital stock if (1) a default on Senior Indebtedness occurs and is continuing that permits holders of such Senior Indebtedness to accelerate its maturity; and (2) such default is the subject of judicial proceedings or the Issuer receives written notice of such default from a representative of the holders of the Senior Indebtedness. If the Issuer receives a notice in accordance with the preceding sentence, a similar notice received within 360 days thereafter relating to the same default on the same issue of Senior Indebtedness shall not be effective for such purpose. The Issuer may resume payments on the Series B Notes, including the Debt Obligations, and may acquire them when (1) such default is cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist or the Senior Indebtedness to which such default relates shall have been paid in full in cash or cash equivalents; or (2) if such default is not the subject of judicial proceedings, 120 days pass after the Issuer receives such written notice (subject to any other prohibitions in the Indenture on such payment or acquisition).
Each holder of a Debt Obligation evidenced by this Master Global Note, by accepting the same, agrees to and shall be bound by the subordination provisions of the Indenture, including those summarized herein, and authorizes and expressly directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination of such Debt Obligation and this Master Global Note and appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes as provided in the Indenture.
 
Subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer set forth in this Master Global Note and as provided in the Indenture referred to above, no reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Master Global Note or of the Indenture shall impair, as between the Issuer and a holder of this Master Global Note or the Debt Obligations evidenced hereby, the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on each Debt Obligation at the times, places, and rates, and in the coin or currency herein prescribed or shall affect the relative rights of the holders of the Series B Notes and creditors of the Issuer other than the holders of the Senior Indebtedness or shall prevent the Trustee or a holder of this Master Global Note from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under the Indenture. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Master Global Note or of the Indenture shall impair or affect, without the consent of a holder of this Master Global Note, the right of such holder to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and interest on each Debt Obligation on or after the respective Stated Maturities, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates against the Issuer.
At the request of the registered owner, the Issuer shall promptly issue and deliver one or more separate note certificates evidencing each Debt Obligation evidenced by this Master Global Note. As of the date any such note certificate or certificates are issued, the Debt Obligations which are evidenced thereby shall no longer be evidenced by this Master Global Note.
Beneficial interests in the Debt Obligations evidenced by this Master Global Note are exchangeable for definitive Series B Notes in registered form, of like tenor and terms and of an equal aggregate principal amount, only if (a) (i) The Depository Trust Company, as depositary (the "Depositary"), notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for this Master Global Note, or (ii) if at any time the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and in either case, a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 90 days after receiving notice or becoming aware the Depositary is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary or is no longer so registered; (b) the Issuer in its sole discretion elects to issue definitive notes; or (c) after the occurrence of an Event of Default relating to a Debt Obligation evidenced by this Master Global Note, beneficial owners representing a majority in principal amount of such Debt Obligation advise the Depositary or other clearing system(s) through its participants to cease acting as depositary for such Debt Obligation evidenced by this Master Global Note. Any beneficial interests in such Debt Obligation that are exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be exchangeable in whole for definitive Series B Notes in registered form, of like tenor and terms and of an equal aggregate principal amount, in minimum denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Such definitive notes shall be registered in the name or names of such person or persons as the Depositary shall instruct the registrar.
Prior to due presentment of this Master Global Note for registration of transfer, the Issuer, the Trustee or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may treat the holder in whose name this Master Global Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Master Global Note be overdue, and neither the Issuer, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary except as required by applicable law.

SUCH FURTHER PROVISIONS SHALL FOR ALL PURPOSES HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS THOUGH FULLY SET FORTH AT THIS PLACE.

In accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Officers' Certificate, the Debt Obligations and other Series B Notes may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption and repayment provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase, or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and events of default, and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture or the Officers' Certificate provided or permitted. The Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of Series B Notes, including the Debt Obligations evidenced by this Master Global Note, that the Issuer may issue under this Series B.
This Master Global Note may have such additional or different terms as are set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement(s) as provided for or permitted in the Indenture or the Officers' Certificate. Any terms so set forth shall be deemed to modify and/or supersede, as necessary, any other terms set forth in this Master Global Note.
The Issuer's obligation to make any payment of principal, premium or interest on the indebtedness evidenced by this Master Global Note, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Indenture referred to above, is subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the principal of and any premium and interest due on all Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer, as defined in the Indenture. As more specifically provided in the Indenture, upon any distribution of assets of the Issuer after any dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization, the holders of Senior Indebtedness are entitled to receive payment in full of principal and any premium and interest due on Senior Indebtedness before the holders of the Debt Obligations are entitled to receive any payment on account of the principal of and any premium or interest on such Debt Obligations (except that holders of the Debt Obligations may receive payment in shares of stock in a reorganization or adjustment in certain circumstances specified in the Indenture). Certain dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization events specified in the Indenture will not be deemed to be a dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization for this purpose. The Issuer may not pay principal of, or any premium or interest on, the Debt Obligations and may not acquire any Debt Obligations for cash

If the Issuer receives a notice in accordance with the preceding sentence, a similar notice received within 360 days thereafter relating to the same default on the same issue of Senior Indebtedness shall not be effective for such purpose. The Issuer may resume payments on the Debt Obligations and may acquire them when (1) such default is cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist or the Senior Indebtedness to which such default relates shall have been paid in full in cash or cash equivalents; or (2) if such default is not the subject of judicial proceedings, 120 days pass after the Issuer receives such written notice (subject to any other prohibitions in the Indenture on such payment or acquisition).

Section 3. Payments of Principal and Interest.
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Issuer shall pay the principal of each Debt Obligation, together with any premium thereon, on the Maturity date of each Debt Obligation or upon any applicable Redemption Date, and shall pay interest thereon from the original issue date of such Debt Obligation (the "Original Issue Date") or such other date specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement or, except as otherwise specified below, from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, on each applicable Interest Payment Date, commencing with the Interest Payment Date immediately following the Original Issue Date or such other date specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, at the applicable rate, until the principal of the Debt Obligation is paid or made available for payment; provided, however, that if the Original Issue Date is between a Regular Record Date and an Interest Payment Date, the initial interest payment will be made on the Interest Payment Date following the next succeeding Regular Record Date to the registered holder on such next succeeding Regular Record Date. The interest so payable and punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Master Global Note (or one or more predecessor Master Global Notes) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date related to the Interest Payment Date, which, unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, shall be the day (whether or not a Business Day) 15 calendar days preceding each Interest Payment Date; provided, however, that interest payable on the Maturity date of any Debt Obligation or any applicable Redemption Date shall be payable to the Person to whom principal shall be payable. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the holder of this Master Global Note on such Regular Record Date and may be paid in accordance with the Indenture (i) to the Person in whose name this Master Global Note (or one or more predecessor Series B Notes) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice of which shall be given to the holder of this Master Global Note not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date; or (ii) in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Series B Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by any such exchange, if such manner of payment is deemed practicable by the Trustee. In the event that any Maturity date or Redemption Date is not a Business Day, the principal otherwise payable on such date will be paid on the next day that is a Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Maturity date or Redemption Date, as applicable, and no interest will accrue for the period from and after such Maturity date or Redemption Date to such next following Business Day. In the event that any Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day and no interest will accrue for the period from and after the scheduled Interest Payment Date, provided that, for LIBOR Debt Obligations and EURIBOR Debt Obligations, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. Unless otherwise specified in an applicable Pricing Supplement, payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Master Global Note due on the Maturity date or any applicable Redemption Date will be made in immediately available funds to the Depositary or its nominee, or registered assigns, as the registered owner of this Master Global Note representing the Debt Obligations; provided, however, that the Issuer may, at its option, pay principal and any premium and interest with respect to any Registered Note by mailing a check to the address of the Person entitled to payment as it
 
appears on the Security Register, except that a holder of this Master Global Note holding $10,000,000 (or the equivalent of $10,000,000 in a currency other than U.S. dollars) or more in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Obligations of like tenor and terms shall be entitled to receive payments by wire transfer of immediately available funds if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received in writing by the Trustee or the applicable Paying Agent not later than ten Business Days prior to the applicable payment date.
The principal of and any premium and interest on the Debt Obligations under this Master Global Note are payable by the Issuer in U.S. dollars, unless the applicable Pricing Supplement specifies otherwise. If the specified currency is other than U.S. dollars, the Issuer will (unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement) arrange to convert all payments in respect of the applicable Debt Obligations under this Master Global Note into U.S. dollars. The amount of any U.S. dollar payment in respect of a Debt Obligation having a specified currency other than U.S. dollars will be based on the bid quoted by the exchange rate agent for the purchase of U.S. dollars with the specified currency for settlement on the payment date and on the aggregate amount of the specified currency payable to the holder of this Master Global Note scheduled to receive such payments. The bid quotation will be as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on the second day preceding the applicable payment date on which banks are open for business in London and New York City. If this bid quotation is not available, such exchange rate agent will obtain a bid quotation from a leading foreign exchange bank in London or New York City selected by such exchange rate agent. If these bids are not available, payment of the aggregate amount due to the holder on the payment date will be in the specified currency. All currency exchange costs will be borne by the holder of this Master Global Note by deductions from such payments due such holder.
If the specified currency is other than U.S. dollars, the holder may (if so indicated in the applicable Pricing Supplement) elect to receive all payments in respect of applicable Debt Obligations under this Master Global Note in the specified currency by delivery of a written notice to the applicable Paying Agent not later than fifteen calendar days prior to the applicable payment date. That election will remain in effect until revoked by written notice to the Paying Agent received no later than fifteen calendar days prior to the applicable payment date.
Section 4. Redemption.
If possible Redemption Dates or periods within which Redemption Dates may occur and the related Redemption Prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount of the applicable Debt Obligations) are set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement, unless the applicable Pricing Supplement specifies otherwise, such Debt Obligations are subject to redemption prior to the Maturity date upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice mailed to the Person in whose name this Master Global Note is registered at such address as shall appear in the Security Register of the Issuer, on any Redemption Date so specified or occurring within any period so specified, as a whole or in part, at the election of the Issuer, at the applicable Redemption Price so specified, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date, provided, however, that installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable in the case of any such redemption to the holder of this Master Global Note (or one or more predecessor Series B Notes) at the close of business on the relevant record dates referred to above, all in accordance with the terms hereof and as provided in the Indenture. If less than all of the Debt Obligations with similar terms are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select the Debt Obligations to be redeemed by a method that the Trustee deems fair and appropriate. Unless the applicable Pricing Supplement specifies otherwise, the Issuer will not be obligated to redeem, purchase or repay Debt Obligations at the option of the holder.
Section 5. Sinking Funds.
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Debt Obligations under this Master Global Note are not subject to any sinking fund or analogous provision.
Section 6. Principal Amount For Indenture Purposes.
For the purpose of determining whether holders of the requisite amount of the Series B Notes, including the Debt Obligations as evidenced by this Master Global Note, outstanding under the Indenture have made a demand, given a notice or waiver or taken any other action, the outstanding principal amount of this Master Global Note shall be deemed to be the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Debt Obligations as evidenced by this Master Global Note.
 
Section 7. Modification and Waivers.
The Indenture permits the modification of the rights and obligations of the Issuer and the rights of the holders of Securities Outstanding under the Indenture at any time by the Issuer and the Trustee with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected, although certain modifications cannot be made without the consent of the holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby. The Indenture also permits the Issuer and the Trustee to modify the Indenture in certain circumstances without the consent of the holders of any Securities at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Series B Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the holders of all Series B Notes, prior to any acceleration of the principal of such Series B Notes, to waive any past default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences, except a default under a covenant that cannot be modified without the consent of each holder of a Series B Note affected thereby. In addition, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Series B Notes may waive all defaults and rescind a declaration of acceleration of the Series B Notes if certain conditions are satisfied. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Master Global Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Master Global Note and of any Master Global Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Master Global Note.
Subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer set forth in this Master Global Note and as provided in the Indenture referred to above, no reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Master Global Note or of the Indenture shall impair, as between the Issuer and a holder of this Master Global Note or the Debt Obligations evidenced hereby, the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on each Debt Obligation at the times, places, and rates, and in the coin or currency herein prescribed or shall affect the relative rights of the holders of the Series B Notes and creditors of the Issuer other than the holders of the Senior Indebtedness or shall prevent the Trustee or a holder of this Master Global Note from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under the Indenture. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Master Global Note or of the Indenture shall impair or affect, without the consent of a holder of this Master Global Note, the right of such holder to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and interest on each Debt Obligation on or after the respective Stated Maturities, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates against the Issuer.
Section 8. Authorized Form and Denominations.
Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Debt Obligations are issuable only in fully registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 or any amount in excess of $1,000 which is an integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Debt Obligations are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Debt Obligations of other authorized denominations and of like tenor and terms of the same series, as requested by the holder surrendering the same.
No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer, the Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Master Global Note is registered in the Security Register as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Master Global Note be overdue, and neither the Issuer, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
