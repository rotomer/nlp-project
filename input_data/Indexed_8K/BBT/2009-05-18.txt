In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 9(a) hereof, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 9(b) hereof, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company.

(d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in Section 8 is for any reason held to be unavailable in accordance with its terms, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the Company and the Underwriters with respect to the Shares that were the subject of the claim for indemnification in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other.
 
The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Shares as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if Underwriters failed to give the notice required under Section 9(c) hereof, then the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute to such aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such liabilities, claims, damages and expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 9(d) were determined pro rata (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation, which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9(d). The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 9(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9(d), the Underwriters shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares referred to in the second sentence of this Section 9(d) that were offered and sold to the public through the Underwriters exceeds the amount of any damages that the Underwriters have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled under this Section 9(d) to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 9(d), each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each Underwriter's Affiliates and selling agents shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each of the directors of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9(d) are several in proportion to the principal amount of Shares set forth opposite their respective names in hereto and not joint.
Schedule II
10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Shares which it has agreed to purchase hereunder at a Time of Delivery, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for the Representatives or another party or other parties to purchase such
 
Shares on the terms contained herein. If within 36 hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Shares, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Shares on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, the Representatives notify the Company that the Representatives have so arranged for the purchase of such Shares, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Shares, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone such Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the Representatives' opinion may thereby be made necessary.

Undersigned's Shares
The foregoing restriction is expressly agreed to preclude the undersigned from engaging in any hedging or other transaction which is designed to or which reasonably could be expected to lead to or result in a sale or disposition of the Undersigned's Shares even if such Shares would be disposed of by someone other than the undersigned and whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of Common Stock or other securities, in cash or otherwise. Such prohibited hedging or other transactions would include without limitation any short sale or any purchase, sale or grant of any right (including without limitation any put or call option) with respect to any of the Undersigned's Shares or with respect to any security that includes, relates to, or derives any significant part of its value from such Shares.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the undersigned may transfer the Undersigned's Shares (i) as a gift or gifts, provided that the donee or donees thereof agree to be bound in writing by the restrictions set forth herein, (ii) to any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of the undersigned or the immediate family of the undersigned, provided that the trustee of the trust agrees to be bound in writing by the restrictions set forth herein, and provided further that any such transfer shall not involve a disposition for value, (iii) to any corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership or general partnership of which all of the equity interest is owned by the undersigned, or the immediate family of the undersigned and/or one or more trusts described in clause (ii) above, (iv) pursuant to a pledge in effect on the date hereof of Shares or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, Shares as security for a margin account pursuant to the terms of such account, (v) if the transfer of the Undersigned's Shares occurs by operation of law, such as rules of intestate succession or statutes governing the effects of a merger, (vi) in payment of the exercise price for options to purchase Shares outstanding on the date hereof, to the Company, or for payment of taxes required to be paid upon the vesting of restricted Shares, in each case pursuant to the terms of the Company's equity incentive plans, or (vii) with the prior written consent of the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters. For purposes of this Lock-Up Agreement, "immediate family" shall mean any relationship by blood, marriage or adoption, not more remote than first cousin. The undersigned now has, and, except as contemplated by this paragraph, for the duration of this Lock-Up Agreement will have, good and marketable title to the Undersigned's Shares, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, and claims whatsoever except for any such liens, encumbrances and claims existing on the date of this Lock-Up Agreement. The undersigned also agrees and consents to the entry of stop transfer instructions with the Company's transfer agent and registrar against the transfer of the Undersigned's Shares except in compliance with the foregoing restrictions.

The undersigned understands that the Company and the Underwriters are relying upon this Lock-Up Agreement in proceeding toward consummation of the offering. The undersigned further understands that this Lock-Up Agreement is irrevocable and shall be binding upon the undersigned's heirs, legal representatives, successors, and assigns.
It is further understood that, if the Company notifies the Underwriters that it does not intend to proceed with the offering, if the Underwriting Agreement does not become effective, or if the Underwriting Agreement (other than the provisions thereof which survive termination) shall terminate or be terminated prior to payment for and delivery of the Shares, the undersigned will be released automatically and immediately from its obligations under this Lock-Up Agreement.
This Lock-Up Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to the conflict of laws provisions thereof.
