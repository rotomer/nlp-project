ITEM 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Effective August 14, 2009, Branch Bank assumed all deposits and acquired certain assets and liabilities of Colonial Bank, an Alabama state-chartered bank headquartered in Montgomery, Alabama ("Colonial Bank"), from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"), as receiver for Colonial Bank (the "Acquisition"), pursuant to the terms of a purchase and assumption agreement entered into by Branch Bank and the FDIC on August 14, 2009 (the "Agreement").
Under the terms of the Agreement, Branch Bank acquired approximately $21.8 billion in assets, including approximately $14.2 billion in loans held and other real estate owned by Colonial Bank, $4.0 billion of marketable securities, $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents (excluding cash paid by the FDIC to complete the Acquisition) and $2.1 billion of other assets. Branch Bank also assumed approximately $23.7 billion in liabilities, including approximately $20.1 billion in customer deposits, $3.3 billion in liabilities to the Federal Home Loan Bank and $263 million in securities repurchase obligations. No other assets were acquired or liabilities assumed from Colonial Bank or its parent entity, Colonial BancGroup, Inc. The deposits were acquired at a premium of 2.77% (except for brokered deposits, CDARS and any market place or similar subscription services deposits, which were acquired without a premium) and certain loans were acquired at a discount to Colonial Bank's historic book value as of June 30, 2009 of approximately $4.5 billion, subject to customary adjustments. In connection with the Acquisition, the FDIC will make a payment to Branch Bank in the amount of approximately $3.5 billion, subject to a customary post-closing adjustment based upon the final closing date balance sheet for Colonial Bank. The terms of the Agreement provide for the FDIC to indemnify Branch Bank against claims with respect to liabilities and assets of Colonial Bank or any of its affiliates not assumed or otherwise purchased by Branch Bank and with respect to claims made by shareholders of Colonial BancGroup, Inc.
In connection with the Acquisition, Branch Bank entered into loss sharing agreements with the FDIC that collectively cover approximately $3.5 billion of single family residential mortgage loans and other real estate owned and approximately $10.8 billion of construction, commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans and securities and other commercial assets (referred to collectively as "covered assets"). Certain other assets of Colonial Bank were acquired by Branch Bank and valued at approximately $5.9 billion that are not covered by loss sharing agreements with the FDIC. These assets include approximately $3.8 billion of marketable securities purchased at fair market value and approximately $220 million of consumer loans (other than single-family residential mortgage loans).
Pursuant to the terms of the loss sharing agreements, the FDIC's obligation to reimburse Branch Bank for losses with respect to covered assets begins with the first dollar of loss incurred. The FDIC will reimburse Branch Bank for 80% of losses of up to $5 billion with respect to covered assets. The FDIC will reimburse Branch Bank for 95% of losses in excess of $5 billion with respect to covered assets. Branch Bank will reimburse the FDIC for 80% of recoveries with respect to losses for which the FDIC paid Branch Bank 80% reimbursement under the loss sharing agreements, and for 95% of recoveries with respect to losses for which the FDIC paid Branch Bank 95% reimbursement under the loss sharing agreements. The loss sharing
agreement applicable to single family residential mortgage loans provides for FDIC loss sharing and Branch Bank reimbursement to the FDIC, in each case as described above, for ten years. The loss sharing agreement applicable to commercial loans and securities provides for FDIC loss sharing for five years and Branch Bank reimbursement to the FDIC for eight years, in each case as described above.
In addition, on October 15, 2019 (the "True-Up Measurement Date"), Branch Bank has agreed to pay to the FDIC 55% of the excess, if any, of (1) $1 billion less (2) the sum of (a) 25% of (i) the aggregate of all of the payments made or payable to Branch Bank under the Shared-Loss Agreements minus (ii) the aggregate of all of the payments made or payable to the FDIC under the Shared-Loss Agreements plus (b) 20% of the sum of the period servicing amounts for every consecutive twelve-month period prior to and ending on the True-Up Measurement Date in respect of each of the shared loss agreements during which the applicable shared loss agreement is in effect (with such period servicing amounts to equal, for any twelve-month period with respect to which respect to each of the shared loss agreements during which such shared loss agreement is in effect, the product of the simple average of the principal amount of shared loss loans and shared loss assets (other than the shared-loss securities) at the beginning and end of such period and 2%).

Brokered deposit accounts are accounts for which the "depositor of record" is an agent, nominee, or custodian who deposits funds for a principal or principals to whom "pass-through" deposit insurance coverage may be extended. The FDIC separates brokered deposit accounts into 2 categories: 1) Depository Organization (DO) Brokered Deposits and 2) Non-Depository Organization (Non-DO) Brokered Deposits. This distinction is made by the FDIC to facilitate our role as Receiver and Insurer. These terms will not appear on other "brokered deposit" reports generated by the institution.
Non-DO Brokered Deposits pass to the Assuming Bank, but are excluded from Assumed Deposits when the deposit premium is calculated. Please see the attached "Schedule 7 Non-DO Broker Deposit Detail Report" for a listing of these accounts. This list will be updated post closing with balances as of Bank Closing date.

Payments with Respect to Shared-Loss Assets
(i) After the Shared Loss Payment Trigger is reached, not later than fifteen (15) days after the date on which the Receiver receives the Monthly Certificate, the Receiver shall pay to the Assuming Bank, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to eighty percent (80%) of the Monthly Shared-Loss Amount reported on the Monthly Certificate.

Losses Under the Stated Threshold
 
(ii) In the event that the sum of the Cumulative Loss Amount under this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement and the Stated Loss Amount under the Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement equals or exceeds the Stated Threshold, the loss/recovery sharing percentages set forth herein shall change from 80/20 to 95/5 and thereafter the Receiver shall pay to the Assuming Bank, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to ninety-five percent (95%) of the Monthly Shared-Loss Amount reported on the Monthly Certificate.

Auditor Report; Right to Audit
(a) Within ninety (90) days after the end of each fiscal year during which the Receiver makes any payment to the Assuming Bank under this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement, the Assuming Bank shall deliver to the Receiver a report signed by its independent
 
public accountants stating that they have reviewed the terms of this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement and that, in the course of their annual audit of the Assuming Bank's books and records, nothing has come to their attention suggesting that any computations required to be made by the Assuming Bank during such fiscal year pursuant to this Article II were not made by the Assuming Bank in accordance herewith. In the event that the Assuming Bank cannot comply with the preceding sentence, it shall promptly submit to the Receiver corrected computations together with a report signed by its independent public accountants stating that, after giving effect to such corrected computations, nothing has come to their attention suggesting that any computations required to be made by the Assuming Bank during such year pursuant to this Article II were not made by the Assuming Bank in accordance herewith. In such event, the Assuming Bank and the Receiver shall make all such accounting adjustments and payments as may be necessary to give effect to each correction reflected in such corrected computations, retroactive to the date on which the corresponding incorrect computation was made.
(b) The Receiver or the FDIC in its corporate capacity ("Corporation") may perform an audit or audits to determine the Assuming Bank's compliance with the provisions of this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement, including this Article II, by providing not less than ten (10) Business Days' prior written notice. Assuming Bank shall provide access to pertinent records and proximate working space in Assuming Bank's facilities. The scope and duration of any such audit shall be within the reasonable discretion of the Receiver or the Corporation, but shall in no event be administered in a manner that unreasonably interferes with the operation of the Assuming Bank's business. The Receiver or the Corporation, as the case may be, shall bear the expense of any such audit. In the event that any corrections are necessary as a result of such an audit or audits, the Assuming Bank and the Receiver shall make such accounting adjustments and payments as may be necessary to give retroactive effect to such corrections.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Article II, the Receiver, upon the direction of the Director (or designee) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Division of Resolutions and Receiverships, may withhold payment for any amounts included in a Monthly Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.1, if in its good faith and reasonable judgment there is a reasonable basis under the requirements of this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement for denying the eligibility of an item for which reimbursement or payment is sought under such Section. In such event, the Receiver shall provide a written notice to the Assuming Bank detailing the grounds for withholding such payment. At such time as the Assuming Bank demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Receiver, in its reasonable judgment, that the grounds for such withholding of payment, or portion of payment, no longer exist or have been cured, then the Receiver shall pay the Assuming Bank the amount withheld which the Receiver determines is eligible for payment, within fifteen (15) Business Days.

Tax Ruling
The Receiver shall be relieved of its obligations with respect to a Shared-Loss Loan upon payment of a Foreclosure Loss amount or a Short Sale Loss amount with respect to such Single Family Shared-Loss Loan or upon the sale without FDIC consent of a Single Family Shared-Loss Loan by Assuming Bank to a person or entity that is not an Affiliate, and any loss on such sale shall be a Portfolio Loss. The Assuming Bank shall provide the Receiver with timely notice of any such sale. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a sale of the Single Family Shared-Loss Loan, for purposes of this Section 2.7, shall not be deemed to have occurred as the result of (i) any change in the ownership or control of Assuming Bank or the transfer of any or all of the Single Family Shared-Loss Loan(s) to any Affiliate of Assuming Bank, (ii) a merger by Assuming Bank with or into any other entity, (iii) a sale by Assuming Bank of all or substantially all of its assets.

The Assuming Bank shall be responsible to the Receiver in the performance of its duties hereunder and shall provide to the Receiver such reports as the Receiver reasonably deems advisable, including but not limited to the reports required by Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 3.3 hereof, and shall permit the Receiver to monitor the Assuming Bank's performance of its duties hereunder.

(i) manage and administer each Shared-Loss Loan in accordance with Assuming Bank's usual and prudent business and banking practices and Customary Servicing Procedures;
(ii) exercise its best business judgment in managing, administering and collecting amounts owed on the Shared-Loss Loans;
(iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to maximize Recoveries with respect to Losses on Shared-Loss Loans without regard to the effect of maximizing collections on assets held by the Assuming Bank or any of its Affiliates that are not Shared-Loss Loans;
 
(iv) retain sufficient staff (in Assuming Bank's discretion) to perform its duties hereunder; and
(v) other than as provided in Section 2.1(a), comply with the terms of the Modification Guidelines for any Single Family Shared-Loss Loans meeting the requirements set forth therein. For the avoidance of doubt, the Assuming Bank may propose exceptions to Exhibit 5 (the FDIC Loan Modification Program) for a group of Loans with similar characteristics, with the objectives of (1) minimizing the loss to the Assuming Bank and the FDIC and (2) maximizing the opportunity for qualified homeowners to remain in their homes with affordable mortgage payments.
(b) Any transaction with or between any Affiliate of the Assuming Bank with respect to any Shared-Loss Loan including, without limitation, the execution of any contract pursuant to which any Affiliate of the Assuming Bank will manage, administer or collect any of the Shared-Loss Loans will be provided to FDIC for informational purposes and if such transaction is not entered into on an arm's length basis on commercially reasonable terms such transaction shall be subject to the prior written approval of the Receiver.
The Assuming Bank shall establish and maintain such records as may be appropriate to account for the Single Family Shared-Loss Loans in such form and detail as the Receiver may reasonably require, and to enable the Assuming Bank to prepare and deliver to the Receiver such reports as the Receiver may from time to time request regarding the Single Family Shared-Loss Loans and the Monthly Certificates required by Section 2.1 of this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement.

Related Loans
(a) Assuming Bank shall use its best efforts to determine which loans are "Related Loans", as hereinafter defined. The Assuming Bank shall not manage, administer or collect any "Related Loan" in any manner that would have the effect of increasing the amount of any collections with respect to the Related Loan to the detriment of the Shared-Loss Loan to which such loan is related. A "Related Loan" means any loan or extension of credit held by the Assuming Bank at any time on or prior to the end of the Final Shared-Loss Month that is made to an Obligor of a Shared-Loss Loan.
(b) The Assuming Bank shall prepare and deliver to the Receiver with the Monthly Certificates for the calendar months ending June 30 and December 31, a schedule of all Related Loans on the Accounting Records of the Assuming Bank as of the end of each such semi-annual period.

such direction. Upon request of the Receiver, the Assuming Bank will advise the Receiver as to the status of any such legal action. The Assuming Bank shall immediately notify the Receiver of any judgment in litigation involving any of the aforesaid special powers or rights.
The Assuming Bank may perform any of its obligations and/or exercise any of its rights under this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement through or by one or more Third Party Servicers, who may take actions and make expenditures as if any such Third Party Servicer was the Assuming Bank hereunder (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such expenses incurred by any such Third Party Servicer on behalf of the Assuming Bank shall be included in calculating Losses to the extent such expenses would be included in such calculation if the expenses were incurred by Assuming Bank); provided, however, that the use thereof by the Assuming Bank shall not release the Assuming Bank of any obligation or liability hereunder.
3.6 .
Third Party Servicer
The Assuming Bank shall have the right, with the consent of the Receiver, to liquidate for cash consideration, from time to time in one or more transactions, all or a portion of Shared-Loss Loans held by the Assuming Bank at any time prior to the Termination Date ("Portfolio Sales"). If the Assuming Bank exercises its option under this Section 4.1, it must give sixty (60) days notice in writing to the Receiver setting forth the details and schedule for the Portfolio Sale, which shall be conducted by means of sealed bid sales to third parties, not including any of the Assuming Bank's affiliates, contractors, or any affiliates of the Assuming Bank's contractors. Sales of Restructured Loans shall be sold in a separate pool from Shared-Loss Loans that have not been restructured. Other proposals for the sale of a Shared-Loss Loan or Shared-Loss Loans submitted by the Assuming Bank will be considered by the Receiver on a case-by-case basis.
4.1 .
Assuming Bank Portfolio Sales of Remaining Shared-Loss Loans
In the event that the Assuming Bank does not conduct a Portfolio Sale pursuant to Section 4.1, the Receiver shall have the right, exercisable in its sole and absolute discretion, to require the Assuming Bank to liquidate for cash consideration, any Shared-Loss Loans held by the Assuming Bank at any time after the date that is six months prior to the Termination Date. If the Receiver exercises its option under this Section 4.2, it must give notice in writing to the Assuming Bank, setting forth the time period within which the Assuming Bank shall be required to liquidate the Shared-Loss Loans. The Assuming Bank will comply with the Receiver's notice and must liquidate the Shared-Loss Loans as soon as reasonably practicable by means of sealed bid sales to third parties, not including any of the Assuming Bank's affiliates, contractors, or any affiliates of the Assuming Bank's contractors. The selection of any financial advisor or other third party broker or sales agent retained for the liquidation of the remaining Shared-Loss Loans pursuant to this Section shall be subject to the prior approval of the Receiver, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.
4.2 .
Assuming Bank's Liquidation of Remaining Shared-Loss Loans
For Shared-Loss Loans that are not Restructured Loans, gain or loss on the sales under Section 4.1 or Section 4.2 will be calculated as the sale price received by the Assuming Bank less the unpaid principal balance of the remaining Shared-Loss Loans. For any Restructured Loan included in the sale gain or loss on sale will be calculated as (a) the sale price received by the Assuming Bank less (b) the net

Dispute Resolution Procedures
(a) In the event a dispute arises about the interpretation, application, calculation of Loss, or calculation of payments or otherwise with respect to this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement ("SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item"), then the Receiver and the Assuming Bank shall make every attempt in good faith to resolve such items within sixty (60) days following the receipt of a written description of the SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item, with notification of the possibility of taking the matter to arbitration (the date on which such 60-day period expires, or any extension of such period as the parties hereto may mutually agree to in writing, herein called the "Resolution Deadline Date"). If the Receiver and the Assuming Bank resolve all such items to their mutual satisfaction by the Resolution Deadline Date, then within thirty (30) days following such resolution, any payment due as a result of such resolution shall be made arising from the settlement of the SF Shared-Loss Dispute.
(b) If the Receiver and the Assuming Bank fail to resolve any outstanding SF Shared-Loss Dispute Items by the Resolution Deadline Date, then either party may notify the other of its intent to submit the SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item to arbitration pursuant to the provisions of this Article VII. Failure of either party to submit pursuant to paragraph (c) hereof any unresolved SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item to arbitration within thirty (30) days following the Resolution Deadline Date (the date on which such thirty (30) day period expires is herein called the "Arbitration Deadline Date") shall extinguish that party's right to submit the non-submitted SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item to arbitration, and constitute a waiver of the submitting party's right to dispute such non-submitted SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item (but not a waiver of any similar claim which may arise in the future).
(c) If a SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item is submitted to arbitration, it shall be governed by the rules of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA"), except as otherwise provided herein. Either party may submit a matter for arbitration by delivering a notice, prior to the Arbitration Deadline Date, to the other party in writing setting forth:
(i) A brief description of each SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item submitted for arbitration;
 
(ii) A statement of the moving party's position with respect to each SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item submitted for arbitration;
(iii) The value sought by the moving party, or other relief requested regarding each SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item submitted for arbitration, to the extent reasonably calculable; and
(iv) The name and address of the arbiter selected by the moving party (the "Moving Arbiter"), who shall be a neutral, as determined by the AAA.
Failure to adequately include any information above shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the parties right to arbitrate so long as after notification of such failure the moving party cures such failure as promptly as reasonably practicable.
(d) The non-moving party shall, within thirty (30) days following receipt of a notice of arbitration pursuant to this Section 6.1, deliver a notice to the moving party setting forth:
(i) The name and address of the arbiter selected by the non-moving party (the "Respondent Arbiter"), who shall be a neutral, as determined by the AAA;
(ii) A statement of the position of the respondent with respect to each Dispute Item; and
(iii) The ultimate resolution sought by the respondent or other relief, if any, the respondent deems is due the moving party with respect to each SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item.
Failure to adequately include any information above shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the non-moving party's right to defend such arbitration so long as after notification of such failure the non-moving party cures such failure as promptly as reasonably practicable
(e) The Moving Arbiter and Respondent Arbiter shall select a third arbiter from a list furnished by the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA"). In accordance with the rules of the AAA, the three (3) arbiters shall constitute the arbitration panel for resolution of each SF Loss-Share Dispute Item. The concurrence of any two (2) arbiters shall be deemed to be the decision of the arbiters for all purposes hereunder. The arbitration shall proceed on such time schedule and in accordance with the Rules of Commercial Arbitration of the AAA then in effect, as modified by this Section 7.1. The arbitration proceedings shall take place at such location as the parties thereto may mutually agree, but if they cannot agree, then they will take place at the offices of the Corporation in Washington, DC, or Arlington, Virginia.
(f) The Receiver and Assuming Bank shall facilitate the resolution of each outstanding SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item by making available in a prompt and timely manner to one another and to the arbiters for examination and copying, as appropriate, all documents, books, and records under their respective control and that would be discoverable under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
 
(g) The arbiters designated pursuant to subsections (c), (d) and (e) hereof shall select, with respect to each Dispute Item submitted to arbitration pursuant to this Section 7.1, either (i) the position and relief submitted by the Assuming Bank with respect to each SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item, or (ii) the position and relief submitted by the Receiver with respect to each SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item, in either case as set forth in its respective notice of arbitration. The arbiters shall have no authority to select a value for each Dispute Item other than the determination set forth in Section 7.1(c) and Section 7.1(d). The arbitration shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties.
(h) Any amounts ultimately determined to be payable pursuant to such award shall bear interest at the Settlement Interest Rate from and including the date specified for the arbiters decisions specified in this Section 7.1, without regard to any extension of the finality of such award, to but not including the date paid. All payments required to be made under this Section 7.1 shall be made by wire transfer.
(i) For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any notice of a SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item(s) is provided prior to the Termination Date, the terms of this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement shall remain in effect with respect to the Single Family Shared-Loss Loans that are the subject of such SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item(s) until such time as any such dispute is finally resolved.
The aggregate fees and expenses of the arbiters shall be shall be borne equally by the parties. The parties shall the aggregate fees and expenses within thirty (30) days after receipt of the written decision of the arbiters (unless the arbiters agree in writing on some other payment schedule).

Objective
The objective of this FDIC Mortgage Loan Modification Program ("Program") is to modify the terms of certain residential mortgage loans so as to improve affordability, increase the probability of performance, allow borrowers to remain in their homes and increase the value of the loans to the FDIC and assignees. The Program provides for the modification of Qualifying Loans (as defined below) by reducing the borrower's monthly housing debt to income ratio ("DTI Ratio") to no more than 31% at the time of the modification and eliminating adjustable interest rate and negative amortization features.
Qualifying Mortgage Loans
In order for a mortgage loan to be a Qualifying Loan it must meet all of the following criteria, which must be confirmed by the lender:
 
 
 
Modification Process
The lender shall undertake a review of its mortgage loan portfolio to identify Qualifying Loans. For each Qualifying Loan, the lender shall determine the net present value of the modified loan and, if it will exceed the net present value of the foreclosed collateral upon disposition, then the Qualifying Loan shall be modified so as to reduce the borrower's monthly DTI Ratio to no more than 31% at the time of the modification. To achieve this, the lender shall use a combination of interest rate reduction, term extension and principal forbearance, as necessary.
The borrower's monthly DTI Ratio shall be a percentage calculated by dividing the borrower's monthly income by the borrower's monthly housing payment (including principal, interest, taxes and insurance). For these purposes, (1) the borrower's monthly income shall be the amount of the borrower's (along with any co-borrowers') documented and verified gross monthly income, and (2) the borrower's monthly housing payment shall be the amount required to pay monthly principal and interest plus one-twelfth of the then current annual amount required to pay real property taxes and homeowner's insurance with respect to the collateral.
In order to calculate the monthly principal payment, the lender shall capitalize to the outstanding principal balance of the Qualifying Loan the amount of all delinquent interest, delinquent taxes, past due insurance premiums, third party fees and (without duplication) escrow advances (such amount, the "Capitalized Balance").
In order to achieve the goal of reducing the DTI Ratio to 31%, the lender shall take the following steps in the following order of priority with respect to each Qualifying Loan:
 
 
 
 
Special Note:
The net present value calculation used to determine whether a loan should be modified based on the modification process above is distinct and different from the net present value calculation used to determine the covered loss if the loan is modified. Please refer only to the net present value calculation described in this exhibit for the modification process, with its separate assumptions, when determining whether to provide a modification to a borrower. Separate assumptions may include, without limitation, Assuming Bank's determination of a probability of default without modification, a probability of default with modification, home price forecasts, prepayment speeds, and event timing. These assumptions are applied to different projected cash flows over the term of the loan, such as the projected cash flow of the loan performing or defaulting without modification and the projected cash flow of the loan performing or defaulting with modification.
By contrast, the net present value for determining the covered loss is based on a 10 year period. While the assumptions in the net present value calculation used in the modification process may change, the net present value calculation for determining the covered loss remains constant.
Related Junior Lien Mortgage Loans
In cases where the lender holds a junior lien mortgage loan that is collateralized by the same property that collateralizes a Qualifying Loan that is modified as described above, the junior lien mortgage loan shall also be modified to enhance overall affordability to the borrower. At a minimum, the lender shall reduce the interest rate on the junior lien mortgage loan to no more than 2% per annum. Further modifications may be made at the lender's discretion as needed to support affordability and performance of the modified first lien Qualifying Loan.
 
This agreement for reimbursement of loss sharing expenses on certain loans and other assets (the "Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement") shall apply when the Assuming Bank purchases Shared-Loss Assets as that term is defined herein. The terms hereof shall modify and supplement, as necessary, the terms of the Purchase and Assumption Agreement to which this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement is attached as Exhibit 4.15B and incorporated therein. To the extent any inconsistencies may arise between the terms of the Purchase and Assumption Agreement and this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement with respect to the subject matter of this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement, the terms of this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement shall control. References in this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement to a particular Section shall be deemed to refer to a Section in this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement unless the context indicates that a Section of the Purchase and Assumption Agreement is intended.
Capitalized terms used in this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement that are not defined in this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement are defined in the Purchase and Assumption Agreement In addition to the terms defined above, defined below are certain additional terms relating to loss-sharing, as used in this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement.

The Assuming Bank shall specify, in the Quarterly Certificate for the final Recovery Quarter, the aggregate amount for all Recovery Quarters only, as of the end of, and including, the final Recovery Quarter of (A) Recoveries plus SLS Net Realized Gains and reversals of OTTI Loss on Shared-Loss Securities ("Aggregate Recovery Period Recoveries"), (B) Recovery Expenses ("Aggregate Recovery Expenses"), and (C)  those Recovery Expenses that have been actually "offset" against Aggregate Recovery Period Recoveries (including those so "offset" in that final Recovery Quarter) ("Aggregate Offset Recovery Expenses"); as used in this sentence, the term "offset" means the amount that has been applied to reduce gross Recoveries in any Recovery Quarter pursuant to the methodology set forth in this Section 2.1(b)(ii). If, at the end of the final Recovery Quarter the amount of Aggregate Recovery Expenses exceeds the amount of Aggregate Recovery Period Recoveries, the Receiver shall have no obligation to pay to the Assuming Bank all or any portion of such excess. Subsequent to the Assuming Bank's calculation of the Recovery Amount (if any) for the final Recovery Quarter, the Assuming Bank shall also show on the Quarterly Certificate for the final Recovery Quarter the results of the following three mathematical calculations: (i) Aggregate Recovery Period Recoveries Aggregate Offset Recovery Expenses; (ii) Aggregate Recovery Expenses Aggregate Offset Recovery Expenses; and (iii) the of the two amounts calculated in (i) and (ii) immediately above ("Additional Recovery Expenses") 80% (the amount so calculated in (iii) being defined as the "Additional Recovery Expense Amount"). If the Additional Recovery Expense Amount is greater than zero, then the Assuming Bank may request in the Quarterly Certificate for the final Recovery Quarter that the Receiver reimburse the Assuming Bank the amount of the Additional Recovery Expense Amount and the Receiver shall pay to the Assuming Bank the Additional Recovery Expense Amount within fifteen (15) days after the date on which the Receiver receives that Quarterly Certificate. On the Quarterly Certificate for the final Recovery Quarter only, the Assuming Bank may include, in addition to any Recovery Expenses for that Recovery Quarter that were paid by or on behalf of the Assuming Bank in that Recovery Quarter, those Recovery Expenses that: (a) were incurred prior to or during the final Recovery Quarter, (b) had been included in any Quarterly Certificate for any Recovery Quarter because they had not been actually paid by or on behalf of the Assuming Bank (in accordance with the terms of this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement) during any Recovery Quarter, (c) were actually paid by or on behalf of the Assuming Bank (in accordance with the terms of this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement) prior to the date the Assuming Bank is required to deliver that final Quarterly Certificate to the Receiver under the terms of Section 2.1(a)(ii).

(iii) With respect to each Shared-Loss Quarter and Recovery Quarter, collections by or on behalf of the Assuming Bank on any charge-off effected by the Failed Bank prior to Bank Closing on an Asset other than a Shared-Loss Asset or Shared-Loss Securities shall be reported as Recoveries under this
 
Section 2.1 only to the extent such collections exceed the Book Value of such Asset, if any. For any Shared-Loss Quarter or Recovery Quarter in which collections by or on behalf of the Assuming Bank on such Asset are applied to both Book Value and to a charge-off effected by the Failed Bank prior to Bank Closing, the amount of expenditures incurred by or on behalf of the Assuming Bank attributable to the collection of any such Asset, that shall be considered a Reimbursable Expense or a Recovery Expense under this Section 2.1 will be limited to a proportion of such expenditures which is equal to the proportion derived by dividing (A) the amount of collections on such Asset applied to a charge-off effected by the Failed Bank prior to Bank Closing, by (B) the total collections on such Assets.
(iv) If the Assuming Bank has duly specified an amount of Reimbursable Expenses on the Quarterly Certificate for the first Recovery Quarter as described above in the last sentence of Section 2.1(a)(ii), then, not later than fifteen (15) days after the date on which the Receiver receives that Quarterly Certificate, the Receiver shall pay to the Assuming Bank an amount equal to eighty percent (80%) (or, if the Cumulative Loss Amount under the Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement plus the cumulative Shared-Loss Amount for all Shared-Loss Quarters equals or exceeds the Stated Threshold, ninety-five percent (95%)) of the amount of such Reimbursable Expenses.
(v) If the First Loss Tranche as determined under the Purchase and Assumption Agreement is a positive number, Receiver has no obligation to make payment for any Shared Loss Quarters until the Shared Loss Payment Trigger is satisfied.
(vi) Payments from the Receiver with respect to this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement are administrative expenses of the Receiver. To the extent the Receiver needs funds for shared-loss payments respect to this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement, the Receiver shall request funds under the Master Loan and Security Agreement, as amended ("MLSA"), from FDIC in its corporate capacity. The Receiver will not agree to any amendment of the MLSA that would prevent the Receiver from drawing on the MLSA to fund shared-loss payments.
The Receiver shall not be required to make any payments pursuant to this Section 2.1 with respect to any Charge-Off of a Shared-Loss Asset that the Receiver or the Corporation determines, based upon the Examination Criteria, should not have been effected by the Assuming Bank; provided, (x) the Receiver must provide notice to the Assuming Bank detailing the grounds for not making such payment, (y) the Receiver must provide the Assuming Bank with a reasonable opportunity to cure any such deficiency and (z) (1) to the extent curable, if cured, the Receiver shall make payment with respect to any properly effected Charge-Off and (2) to the extent not curable, the Receiver shall make a payment as to all Charge-Offs (or portion of Charge-Offs) that were effected which would have been payable as a Charge-Off if the Assuming Bank had properly effected such Charge-Off. In the event that the Receiver does not make any payments with respect to any Charge-Off of a Shared-Loss Asset pursuant to this Section 2.1 or determines that a payment was improperly made, the Assuming Bank and the Receiver shall, upon final resolution, make such accounting adjustments and payments as may be necessary to give retroactive effect to such corrections.

Limitation on Shared-Loss Payment
No Shared-Loss Loan shall be treated as a Shared-Loss Asset pursuant to this Section 2.1 (i) if the Assuming Bank sells or otherwise transfers such Shared-Loss Loan or any interest therein (whether with or without recourse) to any Person, (ii) after the Assuming Bank makes any additional advance, commitment or increase in the amount of a commitment with respect to such Shared-Loss Loan that does not constitute a Permitted Advance or a Shared-Loss Loan Commitment Advance, (iii) after the Assuming Bank makes any amendment, modification, renewal or extension to such Shared-Loss Loan that does not constitute a Permitted Amendment, or (iv) after the Assuming Bank has

Option to Purchase
(i) In the event that the Assuming Bank determines that there is a substantial likelihood that continued efforts to collect a Shared-Loss Asset or an Asset for which a charge-off was effected by the Failed Bank with, in either case, a Legal Balance of $1,000,000 or more on the Accounting Records of the Assuming Bank will result in an expenditure, after Bank Closing, of funds by on behalf of the Assuming Bank to a third party for a specified purpose (the expenditure of which, in its best judgment, will maximize collections), which do not constitute Reimbursable Expenses or Recovery Expenses, and such expenses will exceed ten percent (10%) of the then book value thereof as reflected on the Accounting Records of the Assuming Bank, the Assuming Bank shall (i) promptly so notify the Receiver and (ii) request that such expenditure be treated as a Reimbursable Expense or Recovery Expense for purposes of this Section 2.1. (Where the Assuming Bank determines that there is a substantial likelihood that the previously mentioned situation exists with respect to continued efforts to collect a Shared-Loss Asset or an Asset for which a charge-off was effected by the Failed Bank with, in either case, a Legal Balance of less than $1,000,000 on the Accounting Records of the Assuming Bank, the Assuming Bank may so notify the Receiver and request that such expenditure be treated as a Reimbursable Expense or Recovery Expense.) Within thirty (30) days after its receipt of such a notice, the Receiver will advise the Assuming Bank of its consent or denial, that such expenditures shall be treated as a Reimbursable Expense or Recovery Expense, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the failure of the Receiver to give its consent with respect to such expenditures, the Assuming Bank shall continue to administer such Shared-Loss Asset in accordance with Section 2.2, except that the Assuming Bank shall not be required to make such expenditures. At any time after its receipt of such a notice and on or prior to the Termination Date the Receiver shall have the right to purchase such Shared-Loss Asset or Asset as provided in Section 2.1(e)(iii), notwithstanding any consent by the Receiver with respect to such expenditure.
(ii) During the period prior to the Termination Date, the Assuming Bank shall notify the Receiver within fifteen (15) days after any of the following becomes fully or partially charged-off:
(A) a Shared-Loss Loan having a Legal Balance (or, in the case of more than one (1) Shared-Loss Loan made to the same Obligor, a combined Legal Balance) of $1,000,000 or more in circumstances in which the legal claim against the relevant Obligor survives; or
(B) a Shared-Loss Loan to a director, an "executive officer" as defined in 12 C.F.R. 215.2(d), a "principal shareholder" as defined in 12 C.F.R. 215.2(l), or an Affiliate of the Assuming Bank.
(iii) If the Receiver determines in its discretion that the Assuming Bank is not diligently pursuing collection efforts with respect to any Shared-Loss Asset which has been fully or partially charged-off or written-down (including any Shared-Loss Asset which is identified or required to be identified in a notice pursuant to Section 2.1(e)(ii)) or any Asset for which there exists a Failed Bank Charge-Off/Write-Down, the Receiver may at its option, exercisable at any time on or prior to the Termination Date, require the
 
Assuming Bank to assign, transfer and convey such Shared-Loss Asset or Asset to and for the sole benefit of the Receiver for a price equal to the Shared-Loss Asset Repurchase Price thereof less the Related Liability Amount with respect to any Related Liabilities related to such Shared-Loss Asset or Asset.
(iv) Not later than ten (10) days after the date upon which the Assuming Bank receives notice of the Receiver's intention to purchase or require the assignment of any Shared-Loss Asset or Asset pursuant to Section 2.1(e)(i) or (iii), the Assuming Bank shall transfer to the Receiver such Shared-Loss Asset or Asset and any Credit Files relating thereto and shall take all such other actions as may be necessary and appropriate to adequately effect the transfer of such Shared-Loss Asset or Asset from the Assuming Bank to the Receiver. Not later than fifteen (15) days after the date upon which the Receiver receives such Shared-Loss Asset or Asset and any Credit Files relating thereto, the Receiver shall pay to the Assuming Bank an amount equal to the Shared-Loss Asset Repurchase Price of such Shared-Loss Asset or Asset less the Related Liability Amount.
(v) The Receiver shall assume all Related Liabilities with respect to any Shared-Loss Asset or Asset set forth in the notice described in Section 2.1(e)(iv).

Dispute Resolution
(i) (A) Any dispute as to whether a Charge-Off of a Shared-Loss Asset was made in accordance with Examination Criteria shall be resolved by the Assuming Bank's Chartering Authority. (B) With respect to any other dispute arising under the terms of this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement which the parties hereto cannot resolve after having negotiated such matter, in good faith, for a thirty (30) day period, other than a dispute the Corporation is not permitted to submit to arbitration under the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996 ("ADRA"), as amended, such other dispute shall be resolved by determination of a review board (a "Review Board") established pursuant to Section 2.1(f). Any Review Board under this Section 2.1(f) shall follow the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act and shall follow the provisions of the ADRA. (C) Any determination by the Assuming Bank's Chartering Authority or by a Review Board shall be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto and not subject to further dispute, and judgment may be entered on said determination in accordance with applicable arbitration law in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
(ii) A Review Board shall consist of three (3) members, each of whom shall have such expertise as the Corporation and the Assuming Bank agree is relevant. As appropriate, the Receiver or the Corporation (the "FDIC Party") will select one member, one member will be selected by the Assuming Bank and the third member (the "Neutral Member") will be selected by the other two members. The member of the Review Board selected by a party may be removed at any time by such party upon two (2) days' written notice to the other party of the selection of a replacement member. The Neutral Member may be removed by unanimous action of the members appointed by the FDIC Party and the Assuming Bank after two (2) days' prior written notice to the FDIC Party and the Assuming Bank of the selection of a replacement Neutral Member. In addition, if a Neutral Member fails for any reason to serve or continue to serve on the Review Board, the other remaining members shall so notify the parties to the dispute and the Neutral Member in writing that such Neutral Member will be replaced, and the Neutral Member shall thereafter be replaced by the unanimous action of the other remaining members within twenty (20) business days of that notification.
(iii) No dispute may be submitted to a Review Board by any of the parties to this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement unless such party has provided to the other party a written notice of dispute ("Notice of Dispute"). During the forty-five (45)-day period following the providing of a Notice of Dispute, the parties to the dispute will make every effort in good faith to resolve the dispute by mutual agreement. As part of these good faith efforts, the parties should consider the use of less formal dispute
 
resolution techniques, as judged appropriate by each party in its sole discretion. Such techniques may include, but are not limited to, mediation, settlement conference, and early neutral evaluation. If the parties have not agreed to a resolution of the dispute by the end of such forty-five (45)-day period, then, subject to the discretion of the Corporation and the written consent of the Assuming Bank as set forth in Section 2.1(f)(i)(B) above, on the first day following the end of such period, the FDIC Party and the Assuming Bank shall notify each other of its selection of its member of the Review Board and such members shall be instructed to promptly select the Neutral Member of the Review Board. If the members appointed by the FDIC Party and the Assuming Bank are unable to promptly agree upon the initial selection of the Neutral Member, or a timely replacement Neutral Member as set forth in Section 2.1(f)(ii) above, the two appointed members shall apply to the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), and such Neutral Member shall be appointed in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA.
(iv) The resolution of a dispute pursuant to this Section 2.1(f) shall be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA to the extent that such rules are not inconsistent with this Section 2.1(f). The Review Board may modify the procedures set forth in such rules from time to time with the prior approval of the FDIC Party and the Assuming Bank.
(v) Within fifteen (15) days after the last to occur of the final written submissions of both parties, the presentation of witnesses, if any, and oral presentations, if any, the Review Board shall adopt the position of one of the parties and shall present to the parties a written award regarding the dispute. The determination of any two (2) members of a Review Board will constitute the determination of such Review Board.
(vi) The FDIC Party and the Assuming Bank will each pay the fees and expenses of the member of the Review Board selected by it. The FDIC Party and Assuming Bank will share equally the fees and expenses of the Neutral Member. No such fees or expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Assuming Bank shall be subject to reimbursement by the FDIC Party under this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement or otherwise.
(vii) Each party will bear all costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with the submission of any dispute to a Review Board. No such costs or expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Assuming Bank shall be subject to reimbursement by the FDIC Party under this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement or otherwise. The Review Board shall have no authority to award costs or expenses incurred by either party to these proceedings.
(viii) Any dispute resolution proceeding held pursuant to this Section 2.1(f) shall not be public. In addition, each party and each member of any Review Board shall strictly maintain the confidentiality of all issues, disputes, arguments, positions and interpretations of any such proceeding, as well as all information, attachments, enclosures, exhibits, summaries, compilations, studies, analyses, notes, documents, statements, schedules and other similar items associated therewith, except as the parties agree in writing or such disclosure is required pursuant to law, rule or regulation. Pursuant to ADRA, dispute resolution communications may not be disclosed either by the parties or by any member of the Review board unless:
(1) all parties to the dispute resolution proceeding agree in writing;
(2) the communication has already been made public;
(3) the communication is required by statute, rule or regulation to be made public; or
(4) a court determines that such testimony or disclosure is necessary to prevent a manifest injustice, help establish a violation of the law or prevent harm to the public health or safety, or
 
of sufficient magnitude in the particular case to outweigh the integrity of dispute resolution proceedings in general by reducing the confidence of parties in future cases that their communications will remain confidential.
(ix) Any dispute resolution proceeding pursuant to this Section 2.1(f) (whether as a matter of good faith negotiations, by resort to a Review Board, or otherwise) is a compromise negotiation for purposes of the Federal Rules of Evidence and state rules of evidence. The parties agree that all proceedings, including any statement made or document prepared by any party, attorney or other participants are privileged and shall not be disclosed in any subsequent proceeding or document or construed for any purpose as an admission against interest. Any document submitted and any statements made during any dispute resolution proceeding are for settlement purposes only. The parties further agree not to subpoena any of the members of the Review Board or any documents submitted to the Review Board. In no event will the Neutral Member voluntarily testify on behalf of any party.
(x) No decision, interpretation, determination, analysis, statement, award or other pronouncement of any Review Board shall constitute precedent as regards any subsequent proceeding (whether or not such proceeding involves dispute resolution under this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement) nor shall any Review Board be bound to follow any decision, interpretation, determination, analysis, statement, award or other pronouncement rendered by any previous Review Board or any other previous dispute resolution panel which may have convened in connection with a transaction involving other failed financial institutions or Federal assistance transactions.
(xi) The parties may extend any period of time in this Section 2.1(f) by mutual agreement. Notwithstanding anything above to the contrary, no dispute shall be submitted to a Review Board until each member of the Review Board, and any substitute member, if applicable, agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section 2.1(f) as applicable to members of a Review Board. Prior to the commencement of the Review Board proceedings, or, in the case of a substitute Neutral Member, prior to the re-commencement of such proceedings subsequent to that substitution, the Neutral Member shall provide a written oath of impartiality.
(xii) For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event any notice of dispute is provided to a party under this Section 2.1(g) prior to the Termination Date, the terms of this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement shall remain in effect with respect to any such items set forth in such notice until such time as any such dispute with respect to such item is finally resolved.
The Assuming Bank shall at all times prior to the Termination Date comply with the Rules Regarding the Administration of Shared-Loss Assets as set forth in Article III of this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement.

Auditor Report; Right to Audit
(a) Within ninety (90) days after the end of each fiscal year from and including the fiscal year during which Bank Closing falls to and including the calendar year during which the Termination Date falls, the Assuming Bank shall deliver to the Corporation and to the Receiver a report signed by its independent public accountants stating that they have reviewed the terms of this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement and that, in the course of their annual audit of the Assuming Bank's books and records, nothing has come to their attention suggesting that any computations required to be made by the Assuming Bank during such calendar year by this Article II were not made by the Assuming Bank in accordance herewith. In the event that the Assuming Bank cannot comply with the preceding sentence, it shall promptly submit to the Receiver corrected computations together with a report signed by its independent public accountants stating
 
that, after giving effect to such corrected computations, nothing has come to their attention suggesting that any computations required to be made by the Assuming Bank during such year by this Article II were not made by the Assuming Bank in accordance herewith. In such event, the Assuming Bank and the Receiver shall make all such accounting adjustments and payments as may be necessary to give effect to each correction reflected in such corrected computations, retroactive to the date on which the corresponding incorrect computation was made.
(b) The Assuming Bank shall perform on an annual basis an internal audit of its compliance with the provisions of this Article II and shall provide the Receiver and the Corporation with copies of the internal audit reports and access to internal audit workpapers related to such internal audit.
(c) The Receiver or the Corporation may perform an audit to determine the Assuming Bank's compliance with the provisions of this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement, including this Article II, at any time by providing not less than ten (10) Business Days prior written notice. The scope and duration of any such audit shall be within the discretion of the Receiver or the Corporation, as the case may be, but shall in no event be administered in a manner that unreasonably interferes with the operation of the Assuming Bank's business. The Receiver or the Corporation, as the case may be, shall bear the expense of any such audit. In the event that any corrections are necessary as a result of such an audit, the Assuming Bank and the Receiver shall make such accounting adjustments and payments as may be necessary to give retroactive effect to such corrections.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Article II, the Receiver, upon the direction of the Director (or designee) of the Corporation's Division of Resolutions and Receiverships, may withhold payment for any amounts included in a Quarterly Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.1, if, in its judgment, there is a reasonable basis under the terms of this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement for denying the eligibility of an item for which reimbursement or payment is sought under such Section. In such event, the Receiver shall provide a written notice to the Assuming Bank detailing the grounds for withholding such payment. At such time as the Assuming Bank demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Receiver that the grounds for such withholding of payment, or portion of payment, no longer exist or have been cured, then the Receiver shall pay the Assuming Bank the amount withheld which the Receiver determines is eligible for payment, within fifteen (15) Business Days. In the event the Receiver or the Assuming Bank elects to submit the issue of the eligibility of the item for reimbursement or payment for determination under the dispute resolution procedures of Section 2.1(f), then (i) if the dispute is settled by the mutual agreement of the parties in accordance with Section 2.1(f)(iii), the Receiver shall pay the amount withheld (to the extent so agreed) within fifteen (15) Business Days from the date upon which the dispute is determined by the parties to be resolved by mutual agreement, and (ii) if the dispute is resolved by the determination of a Review Board, the Receiver shall pay the amount withheld (to the extent so determined) within fifteen (15) Business Days from the date upon which the Receiver is notified of the determination by the Review Board of its obligation to make such payment. Any payment by the Receiver pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall be made together with interest on the amount thereof from the date the payment was agreed or determined otherwise to be due, at the interest rate per annum determined by the Receiver to be equal to the coupon equivalent of the three (3)-month U.S. Treasury Bill Rate in effect as of the first Business Day of each Calendar Quarter during which such interest accrues as reported in the Federal Reserve Board's Statistical Release for Selected Interest Rates H.15 opposite the caption "Auction Average - 3-Month" or, if not so reported for such day, for the next preceding Business Day for which such rate was so reported.

Withholdings
The Assuming Bank shall at all times during the term of this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement keep books and records which fairly present all dealings and transactions carried out in connection with its business and affairs. Except as otherwise provided for in the Purchase and Assumption Agreement or this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement, all financial books and
2.5 .
Books and Records
 
records shall be kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied for the periods involved and in a manner such that information necessary to determine compliance with any requirement of the Purchase and Assumption Agreement or this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement will be readily obtainable, and in a manner such that the purposes of the Purchase and Assumption Agreement or this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement may be effectively accomplished. Without the prior written approval of the Corporation, the Assuming Bank shall not make any change in its accounting principles adversely affecting the value of the Shared-Loss Assets except as required by a change in generally accepted accounting principles. The Assuming Bank shall notify the Corporation of any change in its accounting principles affecting the Shared-Loss Assets which it believes are required by a change in generally accepted accounting principles.
The Assuming Bank shall promptly provide to the Corporation such other information, including financial statements and computations, relating to the performance of the provisions of the Purchase and Assumption Agreement or otherwise relating to its business and affairs or this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement, as the Corporation or the Receiver may request from time to time.
2.6 .
Information
The Assuming Bank shall not at any time, without the Corporation's prior written consent, seek a private letter ruling or other determination from the Internal Revenue Service or otherwise seek to qualify for any special tax treatment or benefits associated with any payments made by the Corporation pursuant to the Purchase and Assumption Agreement or this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement.

Exhibit 99.1
Aug. 14, 2009
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
BB&T acquires deposits and certain assets of Colonial Bank in FDIC-assisted deal
Strategically compelling and financially attractive transaction enhances BB&T's franchise in key markets, CEO says
 BB&T Corporation (NYSE: BBT) late this afternoon said it has acquired the banking operations of Colonial Bank of Montgomery, Ala. BB&T has acquired $22 billion in net assets and assumed $20 billion in deposits in the transaction. The FDIC and BB&T have entered into a loss sharing agreement covering substantially all acquired loans and securities.
WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.
The acquisition, BB&T's largest in its 137-year history, creates the nation's eighth largest financial holding company by deposits. It moves BB&T to the No. 4 market share in Alabama and No. 5 in Florida, two key markets in the Southeast. Its No. 4 position in Georgia will not change. BB&T's goal is to be in the top five in deposit market share in all of its markets.
"Today's announcement represents an exciting growth opportunity for BB&T," said BB&T Chief Executive Officer Kelly King. "We're gaining solid market shares in great markets in Alabama, Florida and Georgia. And it comes with minimal asset risk to BB&T because of our loss sharing agreement with the FDIC."
The announcement follows a decision by Alabama regulators to close Colonial Bank and name the FDIC as receiver. Under the terms of the agreement, BB&T has assumed all of Colonial Bank's deposit accounts, whether or not insured by the FDIC. BB&T will not acquire any of the assets or assume any obligations of Colonial's holding company or select assets and liabilities of Colonial Bank, including any relating to Taylor, Bean and Whitaker Mortgage Corporation.
Also excluded are assets and liabilities the FDIC determines are related to fraudulent or criminal activities. BB&T is indemnified by the FDIC for any liabilities not expressly assumed in the transaction, including those related to fraudulent, criminal or inappropriate activities of Colonial.
More than 425 BB&T employees will work side-by-side with Colonial employees and their clients during the transition. All of Colonial's 354 banking offices in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Texas and Nevada will reopen as branches of BB&T, one of the strongest capitalized banks in the nation. Depositors will continue to be insured by the FDIC to the same extent as before the acquisition.
Over the weekend, Colonial branches that run normal Saturday hours will be open. Depositors can also access their money by writing checks or using ATM or debit cards. Checks drawn on the bank will continue to be processed.
Colonial clients soon will have access to BB&T's existing network of more than 1,500 ATMs in 11 Southeastern and mid-Atlantic states and Washington, D.C.
"For our valued new clients, this will be a seamless transition effective immediately," King said. "As far as clients are concerned, it's simply a combination of two banks. There will be no interruption in service and clients should expect business as usual."
Colonial had plans to sell its 22 branches in Texas and 22 branches in Nevada. BB&T officials said they'll make a final decision on those branches at a later date.
Founded in 1981, Colonial has more than 4,500 employees and is one of the 30 largest financial holding companies in the nation.
King said that BB&T emerged as a top candidate for the failed institution because of BB&T's ongoing strength during the financial crisis. BB&T was one of the first 10 institutions to pay back the government's investment through the Troubled Asset Relief Program.
BB&T soon will begin communicating "the BB&T story" to Colonial clients, employees and communities, King said. "BB&T has been a strong and stable company over the past 137 years. We want our new clients and communities to know that we're here for them, their deposits are completely safe and secure, and we're committed to providing them the BB&T brand of highly personalized service."
BB&T will create new community bank regions in Birmingham and Montgomery and two in Florida. BB&T is organized as a series of community banks, which allows for decision-making to be kept close to the client. BB&T currently operates 33 community bank regions, each with its own president and senior credit team.
 
"Through our decentralized operating structure, we'll offer Colonial clients the BB&T community bank feel from the same familiar faces they're used to banking with," King said. "But we'll also offer the wide array of banking, insurance, investments and many other financial services you'd expect from one of the nation's largest financial holding companies."
BB&T was advised in the transaction by Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.
BB&T participated in a previous FDIC-aided transaction in December when it paid $112,000 to assume $515 million in deposits from the former Haven Trust Bank of Duluth, Ga. It also received $55 million in assets consisting primarily of cash and marketable securities in that deal.
BB&T will provide more information about the Colonial transaction at www.bbt.com/investor prior to market opening on Monday.
With $152.4 billion in assets, Winston-Salem, N.C.-based BB&T Corporation was the nation's 10th largest financial holding company by assets and operated more than 1,500 financial centers in 11 states and Washington, D.C., at June 30. More information about the company is available at BBT.com.
