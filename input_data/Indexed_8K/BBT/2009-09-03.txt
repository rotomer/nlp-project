All extensions of credit made to Ms. Powell by BB&T were made in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with others not related to BB&T, and did not involve more than normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.
