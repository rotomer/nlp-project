BB&T reports 2
nd
quarter EPS totaling $.30, up 50%; Earnings per share total $.33 excluding merger charges
BB&T disposes of $682 million in problem assets
     
WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.
-- BB&T Corporation (NYSE: BBT) today reported earnings for the second quarter of 2010. Net income available to common shareholders totaled $210 million, or $.30 per diluted common share, compared with $121 million, or $.20 per diluted common share, earned during the second quarter of 2009. These results reflect increases of 73.6% and 50.0%, respectively. Results include $38 million, or $.03 per share, of merger-related charges.
     
"BB&T's core businesses continued to produce solid results in the second quarter," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kelly S. King. "In particular, we have seen a pick up in lending, with $17.5 billion in originations this quarter compared to $15.4 billion in the first quarter. This growth is led by prime auto, C&I and prime mortgage. We also grew net revenues 6.4% on an annualized basis compared to the first quarter excluding securities gains and FDIC loss share income.
     
"In addition, we successfully implemented a strategy to accelerate our disposition of problem assets," said King. "Our primary goals for the strategy are to reduce the company's exposure to nonperforming assets and reduce or eliminate any delay exiting the credit cycle. Our long-term plan has always been to sell problem assets as pricing improved. Early in the second quarter, we reached an inflection point and have seen more bidders and more acceptable valuations for problem assets. As a result, we disposed of $682 million of problem assets, lowering our balance sheet risk and making significant progress in meeting the goals of the strategy.
     
"Finally, this quarter we successfully completed the systems conversion of Colonial, the largest in our history. It was potentially the best execution of any acquisition in our history, as we have received an overwhelmingly positive response from clients and employees of Colonial."
Quarterly Highlights Include:
     
BB&T responds to financial industry reform legislation
     
This week the President signed sweeping legislation that will significantly affect America's financial system. While BB&T supports many components of the legislation, we are also concerned about the uncertainty it creates and the potential for unintended consequences.
     
"In terms of the legislation's impact on BB&T, our business model is still that of a traditional commercial bank, so many of the provisions will have little or no impact on us," said King. "While we will initially have moderately higher costs and reduced revenues in some areas, we will effectively implement the provisions of the law and we expect little effect on our long-term performance. We do expect some changes in the products and services that we offer, and will minimize any impact to our clients. We continue to make as many good loans as possible and are dedicated to financing economic growth in our markets."
Acquired loan assessment indicates continued outperformance
     
After completing its second quarter assessment of cash flows on acquired loans, BB&T determined that the loans continue to outperform prior estimates. The assessment, combined with the results of the first quarter assessment, resulted in additional interest income of $100 million recorded in the second quarter. The increase results primarily from improving expectations for cash flows. The assessment also revealed minimal additional impairment in certain loans, offset by recoveries in other loans resulting in a $2 million reversal of provision for loan and lease losses. Approximately 80% of both the additional accretion and provision reversal are offset through the FDIC receivable and noninterest income due to the provisions of the FDIC loss sharing agreements.
Noninterest revenues increased 4.6%
     
Noninterest income increased $46 million, or 4.6%, in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period last year primarily due to a $200 million increase in securities gains, offset by a $74 million decrease in mortgage banking revenues and a $78 million reduction in noninterest income to reflect the 80% reduction in expected receivables from the FDIC due to better acquired loan performance.
     
BB&T earned $110 million in mortgage-related revenue in the second quarter of 2010, an increase of 94.6%, on an annualized basis, compared with the first quarter of 2010, but a decrease of 40.2% compared to the second quarter last year. The increase in mortgage banking income from the first quarter is primarily due to increased refinance activity created by a favorable interest rate environment. BB&T originated $5.0 billion of mortgage loans during the second quarter of 2010 compared to $4.8 billion in originations in the first quarter and $8.5 billion in the second quarter last year.
     
BB&T insurance operations produced record quarterly revenues of $287 million in the second quarter of 2010, up 2.1% compared with the second quarter of 2009. Insurance income increased 53.9% on an annualized basis compared to the first quarter this year.
's
     Checkcard fees and other nondeposit fees and commissions increased 22.8% and 18.9%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2009. The increase in checkcard fees was primarily due to increased usage by new and existing clients. The growth in nondeposit fees and commissions was primarily the result of increased commercial lending related revenues. Service charges on deposit accounts totaled $164 million in the second quarter of 2010, a decrease of 2.4% compared to the same quarter of 2009. The decrease in service charges was primarily due to a change in BB&T's overdraft policies. Trust and investment advisory revenue increased 18.2% for this same period due to improved market conditions and an increase in assets under management led by Sterling Capital Management.
     
Other noninterest income totaled ($2 million) during the second quarter of 2010, compared with $42 million for the same period of 2009. Other income decreased $19 million as a result of market-related decreases in trading assets for post-employment benefits that are offset by a similar decrease in personnel expense and $20 million for client derivative losses and lower trading gains at Scott & Stringfellow.
Noninterest expenses increase primarily due to the Colonial acquisition and higher credit costs
     
BB&T's noninterest expenses increased $319 million, or 27.0%, in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. The increase included $180 million of additional maintenance costs, net losses from sales and write-downs in the value of foreclosed properties; $39 million in merger-related charges; and $36 million as a result of a gain on extinguishment of debt recorded in the second quarter of 2009. These increases were partially offset by declines of $19 million for post-employment benefits expense that are offset by a reduction in noninterest income; $15 million for pension plan expense and a $71 million charge related to the FDIC special assessment that was incurred in the second quarter last year. Excluding these items and expenses related to the Colonial acquisition of approximately $125 million, noninterest expenses were up approximately 4% compared to the second quarter of last year.

       Regulatory capital ratios are preliminary
     
This news release contains performance measures determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). BB&T's management uses these "non-GAAP" measures in their analysis of the corporation's performance. BB&T's
management uses these measures to evaluate the underlying performance and efficiency of its operations. It believes that these non-GAAP measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of results with prior periods as well as demonstrating the effects of significant gains and charges in the current period. The company believes that a meaningful analysis of its financial performance requires an understanding of the factors un derlying that performance. BB&T's management believes that investors may use these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze financial performance without the impact of unusual items that may obscure trends in the company's underlying performance. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Tangible common equity and Tier 1 common equity ratios are non-GAAP measures. BB&T uses the Tier 1 common equity definition used in the SCAP assessment to calculate these ratios. BB&T's management uses these measures to assess the quality of capital and believes that investors may find them useful in their analysis of the corporation. These capital measures are not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures that may be presented by other companies. Asset quality ratios have been adjusted to remove the impact of acquir ed loans and foreclosed property covered by the FDIC loss sharing agreements as management believes their inclusion results in distortion of those ratios and may not be comparable to other periods presented or to other portfolios that were not impacted by purchase accounting.
     
This news release contains certain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address issues that involve significant risks, uncertainties, estimates and assumptions made by management. Actual results may differ materially from current projections. Please refer to BB&T's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a summary of important factors that may affect BB&T's forward-looking statements. BB&T undertakes no obligation to revise these statements following the date of this news release.

This
presentation contains financial information determined
by
methods
other than in
accordance
with
accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of
America ("GAAP")
.
BB&T's management
uses these "non-
GAAP" measures
in their
analysis
of the
Corporation's performance. BB&T's management believes
that these non-GAAP
financial measures provide
a
greater understanding
of
ongoing operations
and
enhance c omparability
of results with prior
periods
as well as
demonstrating
the effects of
significant
gains and
charges
in the
current period.
The
Company believes
that a
meaningful analysis
of its
financial performance requires
an
understanding
of the factors
underlying
that
performance. BB&T's management believes
that
investors
may use these non-GAAP
financial measures
to
analyze financial performance without
the impact of
unusual
items that may
obscure
trends in the
Company's underlying performance.
These
disclosures
should not be
viewed
as a
substitute
for
operating
results
determined
in
accordance
with
GAAP,
nor are they
necessarily comparable
to non-GAAP
performance measures
that may be
presented
by other
comp anies. BB&T's management
uses these
measures
to
evaluate
the
underlying performance
and
efficiency
of its
operations. BB&T's management believes
these
measures
reflect core trends of the
business, excluding purchase accounting amortization
that will cease in the future, while the
acquired business
will
remain. Tangible common
equity and Tier 1
common
equity ratios are Non-GAAP
measures.
BB&T uses the Tier 1
common
equity
definition
used in the SCAP
assessment
to
calculate
these ratios.
BB&T's management
uses these
measures
to
assess
the quality of capital and
believes
that
investors
may find them useful in their
analysis
of the
Corporation.
These capital
measures
are not
necessarily comparable
to similar capital
measures
that may be
presented
by other
companies.
Asset quality ratios have been
adjusted
to
remove
the impact of
acquired
loans and
foreclosed property covered
by the FDIC loss
sharing agreements
as
management believes
their
inclusion
results in
distortion
of those ratios and may not be
comparable
to other
periods presented
or to other
portfolios
that were not
impacted
by
purchase accounting.
A
reconciliation
of these non-GAAP
measures
to the most
directly comparable
GAAP
measure
is
included
on the
Investor Relations section
of
BB&T's website
(
www.bbt.
com/investor
) and as an
appendix
to this
presentation.
