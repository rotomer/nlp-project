BB&T Corporation (the "Company") maintains a Non-Qualified Defined Benefit Plan and a Target Pension Plan (together, the "Non-Qualified Plans"), each of which provides supplemental retirement benefits to participants to the extent that the benefits payable under the Company's tax-qualified Pension Plan (the "Pension Plan") are curtailed by application of limitations contained in the tax code.  Each of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table in the Company's 2010 proxy statement (the "Named Executive Officers") participates in a Non-Qualified Plan.
     
On December 14, 2010, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted amendments to each of the Non-Qualified Plans which are effective as of January 1, 2011 (the "Amendments").  The Amendments increase the lump sum death benefit payable to the surviving beneficiary of a participant who dies while an active employee from the actuarial equivalent of the survivor portion of a 50% joint and survivor annuity under the plan's formula to the survivor portion of a 100% joint and survivor annuity under the plan's formula.  Each Named Executive Officer's estimated in-service death benefit following the Amendments is approximately double the in-service death benefit under the Non-Qualified Plans prior to the Amendments, however, the precise amount of the increases vary based upon each participant's ac crued benefits under the applicable Non-Qualified Plan.
