FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
BB&T among the first large banks to increase dividend
Maintains one of the strongest payouts to shareholders in the industry
Declares 6.7% increase and special 1-cent dividend for first quarter
WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.
 The board of directors of BB&T Corporation (NYSE: BBT) today declared a 1-cent increase in the 2011 second-quarter dividend, as well as a special 1-cent dividend. After a review of BB&Ts capital plan and projections under very rigorous scenarios, the Federal Reserve today did not object to BB&Ts request to raise the dividend.
The total second-quarter dividend is $0.16 plus the $0.01 special dividend per common share. At this quarterly rate, the annual dividend is equivalent to $0.64 per common share. The $0.16 regular dividend represents a 6.7% increase over last years dividend.
BB&T is pleased to provide this increase in our dividend and to be in the first group allowed to increase the dividend, said Chairman and CEO Kelly King. We continue to be one of the strongest capitalized institutions in the industry and we believe this action confirms that strength.
We are proud to have maintained the fourth highest dividend yield among S&P 500 banks. We view this as a good first step to further increases in the future, said King.
The dividends will be paid May 2, 2011, to shareholders of record as of April 8, 2011. BB&T has one of the strongest dividend payouts in the country for banks and has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1903. The company has approximately 694 million shares outstanding.
