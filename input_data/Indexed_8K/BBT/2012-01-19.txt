FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
BB&Ts 4
th
quarter EPS totals $0.55, up 83% Earnings up 88% to $391 million
2011 earnings total $1.3 billion, up 58%
     
WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. -- BB&T Corporation (NYSE: BBT) today reported fourth quarter net income available to common shareholders of $391 million, an increase of 88% compared to $208 million reported in the fourth quarter 2010. Earnings per diluted common share totaled $0.55, an increase of 83%, compared to $0.30 earned in the fourth quarter last year.
     
For 2011, net income available to common shareholders was $1.3 billion, or $1.83 per diluted common share, compared with $816 million, or $1.16 per diluted common share, earned in 2010. This reflects an increase of 58% for both net income available for common shareholders and earnings per share.
     
The year 2011 was an outstanding year for BB&T considering the challenges facing the economy and financial services industry, said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kelly S. King. We met essentially all of our strategic objectives, and are successfully emerging from the credit cycle. We are also very pleased to report a strong performance for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our fourth quarter net income available to common shareholders of $391 million reflects our strongest quarterly earnings since mid 2008. The increase was driven by improved revenues, accelerating loan growth and much improved credit quality. Adjusted revenues totaled $2.3 billion this quarter, up an annualized 12% compared to last quarter.
     
BB&Ts loan growth continues to accelerate, King said. Average loans held for investment grew an annualized 7%, and, excluding our covered and residential ADC portfolios,
increased an annualized 10%. We are very optimistic about our loan growth, as production pipelines remain robust.
     
BB&T had another strong quarter growing deposits and improving our deposit mix, King said. Average deposits increased 24% on an annualized basis compared to the third quarter, and noninterest-bearing deposits and interest checking increased 31% and 10%, respectively. We made further progress on our strategy to reduce the cost of interest-bearing deposits. The cost this quarter was 0.56% compared with 0.65% last quarter.
     
We announced last quarter an effort to drive foreclosed property balances lower by implementing a more aggressive disposition strategy, said King. This effort proved very successful, as our OREO balances, excluding covered foreclosed property, declined 41% and nonperforming assets declined 17% by the end of the quarter.
     
Given our strong momentum in growing revenues, loans and deposits, combined with our outlook for significantly lower credit costs and focus on efficiency, we are very optimistic about 2012, said King.

Fourth Quarter 2011 compared to Fourth Quarter 2010
     
Consolidated net income available to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2011 of $391 million was up 88.0% compared to $208 million earned during the same period in 2010. On a diluted per common share basis, earnings for the fourth quarter of 2011 were $0.55, up 83.3% compared to $0.30 for the same period in 2010. BB&Ts results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2011 produced an annualized return on average assets of 0.93% and an annualized return on average common shareholders equity of 8.76% compared to prior year ratios of 0.54% and 4.88%, respectively.

Total revenues were $2.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011, up $78 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. The increase in total revenues was primarily due to $120 million of higher net interest income, primarily driven by lower borrowing and deposit costs. The net interest margin was 4.02%, down 2 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Noninterest income decreased $42 million. The decrease in noninterest income was largely attributable to a decrease of $46 million for FDIC loss share income due to the lower offset related to the provision for covered loans and the impact of cash flow reassessments. In addition, checkcard fees were lower $31 million primarily due to the implementation of the Durbin amendment and investment banking and brokerage fees were lower $22 million due to decreased activity. These decreases were partially offset by $51 million of fewer losses and writedowns on the commercial loans held for sale in connection with managements nonperforming loan disposition strategy.
     
Noninterest expenses were $1.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011, up $197 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. The increase in noninterest expenses was primarily due to a $184 million increase in foreclosed property expenses as management accelerated its strategy to reduce the inventory of foreclosed property.
     
The provision for credit losses, excluding covered loans, for the fourth quarter of 2011 declined $320 million, or 58.9%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, as improving credit quality resulted in lower provision expense. The provision for covered loans decreased $51 million, which was offset by a corresponding $41 million decrease in FDIC loss share income. Net charge-offs, excluding covered loans, for the fourth quarter of 2011 were $158 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2010. The level of nonperforming assets, loan delinquencies and the outlook for future credit losses improved significantly during 2011.
     
An $84 million provision for income taxes was recorded for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to $15 million for the fourth quarter of 2010. This resulted in an effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 of 17.4% compared to 6.5% for the prior years fourth quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to higher levels of pre-tax earnings in 2011 compared to 2010.
Fourth Quarter 2011 compared to Third Quarter 2011
     
Consolidated net income available to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2011 of $391 million was up $25 million, or an annualized 27.1% compared to $366 million earned during the third quarter of 2011. On a diluted per common share basis, earnings for the fourth quarter of 2011 were $0.55, up $0.03, or an annualized 22.9%, compared to the amount earned in the third quarter of 2011. BB&Ts results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2011 produced an annualized return on average assets of 0.93% and an annualized return on average common shareholders equity of 8.76% compared to prior quarter ratios of 0.89% and 8.30%, respectively.
     
Total revenues were $2.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011, up $267 million compared to the third quarter of 2011. The increase in total revenues was the result of higher noninterest
4
income and net interest income in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the prior quarter. Noninterest income was up $232 million compared to the third quarter of 2011. The increase in noninterest income included a $142 million increase in net securities gains due primarily to sales of securities in the current quarter, a $58 million increase in FDIC loss share income due to higher offset for the provision for covered loans and the cumulative effect of cash flow reassessments and $26 million in fewer losses and writedowns on problem commercial loans held for sale. These increases were partially offset by $36 million in lower Checkcard fees due to the implementation of the Durbin amendment. Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was up $35 million due to higher average earning asset balances in both loans and securities that were partially offset by a lower margin. The margin for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 4.02%, down 7 basis points from the third quarter.
     
The provision for credit losses, excluding covered loans, for the fourth quarter of 2011 declined $20 million compared to the third quarter of 2011 largely as a result of a reduction in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments due to improving credit trends. The provision for covered loans increased $42 million, which was offset by a corresponding $33 million increase in FDIC loss share income. Net charge-offs, excluding covered loans, for the fourth quarter of 2011 were $14 million higher than the third quarter of 2011.
     
Noninterest expenses were $1.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011, up $201 million compared to the third quarter of 2011. The increase in noninterest expenses was primarily due to a $178 million increase in foreclosed property expenses as management accelerated its strategy to reduce the inventory of foreclosed property.
     
The provision for income taxes was $84 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to $68 million for the third quarter of 2011. This produced an effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 of 17.4% compared to 15.5% for the prior quarter. The current quarter included income tax benefits of $12 million for changes to the deferred tax rate and state income tax return to provision adjustments. The prior quarter included a $26 million tax benefit related to the sale of leveraged leases.

(1) Presents amounts related to covered and acquired loans, covered securities and the FDIC loss sharing asset recognized in the Colonial acquisition. Excludes all amounts related to other assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition.
Fourth Quarter 2011 compared to Fourth Quarter 2010
     
Interest income for the fourth quarter of 2011 on loans and securities acquired in the Colonial acquisition decreased $35 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Interest income on acquired loans decreased $28 million reflecting lower average loan balances partially offset by higher yields due to the cumulative impact of changes to expected cash flows based on the quarterly cash flow reassessment process required by acquisition accounting. The yield on covered and other acquired loans for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 19.11% compared to 16.71% in 2010. At December 31, 2011, the accretable yield balance on these loans was $1.8 billion. Accretable yield represents the excess of expected future cash flows above the current net carrying amount of loans and will be recognized into income over the remaining life of the covered and acquired loans. Interest income related to covered securities decreased $7 million due primarily to security duration adjustments in 2010.
     
The provision for covered loans was $49 million in the current quarter, a decrease of $51 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. The fourth quarter of 2011 reassessment showed decreases in expected cash flows in certain loan pools that were partially offset by recoveries in other previously impaired loan pools. These decreases in 2011 were less than those estimated in the fourth quarter 2010 reassessment.
     
FDIC loss share income, net was a negative $46 million for the fourth quarter of 2011. Of the $46 million, $71 million was negative accretion attributable to the offset for the cumulative impact of cash flow reassessments for acquired loans, $14 million was due to loss sharing on interest income accretion for covered securities reduced by $39 million related to the 80% offset
6
of provision for covered loans. The negative accretion related to the improvement in credit losses is recognized on a level yield basis over the life of the related FDIC loss share asset, which has a shorter weighted average life than the corresponding loans.
Fourth Quarter 2011 compared to Third Quarter 2011
     
Interest income on loans and securities acquired in the Colonial acquisition was $31 million lower in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the third quarter. The yield on covered and other acquired loans for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 19.11%, down slightly compared to 20.41% in the earlier quarter as a result of the fourth quarter reassessment.
     
The provision for covered loans was $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. This was offset by a corresponding $39 million increase in FDIC loss share income.
     
FDIC loss share income, net improved $58 million due to the provision for covered loans offset and the cumulative impact of cash flow reassessments.

Fourth Quarter 2011 compared to Fourth Quarter 2010
     
Noninterest income was $922 million for fourth quarter of 2011 compared to $964 million for the fourth quarter of 2010. Investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions decreased $22 million, or 22.7%, largely as a result of a record quarter in 2010. Checkcard fees declined $31 million, or 42.5%, compared to the same period of 2010 due primarily to the implementation of the Durbin amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 on October 1, 2011. FDIC loss share income decreased $46 million
7
primarily as a result of cash flow reassessments and the offset to the provision for covered loans. Net securities gains increased $4 million compared to the prior year quarter, $20 million from higher gains on securities sold less $16 million in higher other-than-temporary impairments. Other income improved $45 million primarily as a result of fewer losses and writedowns recorded on commercial loans held for sale in connection with managements nonperforming loan disposition strategy that was substantially completed during the third quarter of 2011. Other income also included $13 million of additional income from partnership and other investments and a reduction of $13 million on assets associated with certain post-employment benefits, which is offset by lower personnel costs.
Fourth Quarter 2011 compared to Third Quarter 2011
     
Noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2011 was up $232 million compared to the third quarter of 2011. Insurance income increased $13 million, or an annualized 21.4%, compared to the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to a seasonally stronger fourth quarter. Mortgage banking income was up $12 million compared to the prior quarter due to a $20 million increase from higher gains on mortgages sold, partially offset by $8 million of lower gains from positive hedge performance of the mortgage servicing asset. Checkcard fees decreased $36 million due to the Durbin amendment. FDIC loss share income was better $58 million compared to the third quarter of 2011 primarily as a result of the impact of cash flow reassessments and the offset to the provision for covered loans. Securities gains were $142 million higher due to $137 million in higher gains on securities sold and $5 million in other-than-temporary impairment in the current quarter compared to the prior quarter. Other income increased $48 million compared to the third quarter of 2011. The increase in other income includes lower losses and writedowns of $26 million on commercial loans held for sale and $13 million of higher income on assets for certain post-employment benefits, which is offset in personnel costs. In addition, other income increased $7 million due to higher income from partnership and other investments.

Noninterest expense was $1.6 billion for fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of $197 million, or 13.9%, compared to the same quarter of 2010. Personnel expense was flat compared to the same quarter of last year. This included an increase of $17 million in salaries primarily due to hiring and customary salary increases and a decrease of $13 million related to certain post-employment benefits that were offset through lower noninterest income. Foreclosed property expense increased $184 million, or 113.6%, largely due to an increase in writedowns and losses as management accelerated a more aggressive approach to reduce foreclosed real estate. Regulatory charges decreased $13 million, or 22.0%, as a result of improved credit quality which has led to lower deposit insurance premiums. Merger-related and restructuring charges were $16 million, an increase of $12 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, due primarily to charges associated with managements expense optimization efforts and costs related to the BankAtlantic acquisition. Other expenses were up slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. This includes an $11 million charge for an increase to the indemnification reserve related to the 2008 sale of Visa stock, partially offset by a net reduction in other expenses.
Fourth Quarter 2011 compared to Third Quarter 2011
     
Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2011 was up $201 million compared to the third quarter of 2011. Personnel expense increased $8 million, or an annualized 4.7%.

managements expense optimization efforts and costs related to the BankAtlantic acquisition. Other expenses were down $9 million, or an annualized 16.5%, compared to the prior quarter.
The improvement includes a $16 million reduction related to a loss on sale of leveraged leases that occurred in the third quarter of 2011. This improvement was partially offset by an $11 million charge in the current quarter for an increase to the indemnification reserve related to the 2008 sale of Visa stock.
 
Fourth Quarter 2011 compared to Fourth Quarter 2010
     
Average loans held for investment for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $105.8 billion, up $3.4 billion compared to the corresponding period of 2010. The growth in average loans and leases was broad-based and across all of the major lending portfolios. Average commercial and industrial loans increased $2.5 billion, or 7.6%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. The growth in average commercial and industrial loans reflects managements focused efforts at growing this component of the loan portfolio. Average commercial real estate  residential ADC and commercial real estate  other declined 37.0% and 7.0%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 as management has intentionally lowered exposures to higher-risk real estate lending during the economic downturn. Average mortgage loans increased $3.1 billion, or 18.1%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, due to the decision to retain a portion of the 10 to 15 year fixed-rate and adjustable rate mortgage production beginning in the third quarter of 2010. Average loans originated in other lending subsidiaries were up $690 million, or 8.7%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, as the majority of these specialized businesses experienced growth.

Average loans held for investment for the fourth quarter of 2011 was up $1.9 billion, or an annualized 7.3%, compared to the third quarter of 2011. The growth in average loans accelerated during the fourth quarter and was broad-based across most of the major lending portfolios. Average commercial and industrial loans and leases increased $952 million, or an annualized 11.0%, compared to the third quarter of 2011, due to focused efforts to grow this component of the loan portfolio and strong growth from mortgage warehouse lending, which was up $395 million compared to the third quarter of 2011. Average commercial real estate  residential ADC and commercial real estate  other declined an annualized 42.8% and 8.2%, respectively, compared to third quarter of 2011 due to managements objective of diversifying the mix of the commercial lending portfolio and lowering exposure to higher-risk real estate lending.

Fourth Quarter 2011 compared to Fourth Quarter 2010
     
Average deposits for the fourth quarter of 2011 increased $16.3 billion, or 15.5%, compared to the same period in 2010.

Certificates and other time deposits also increased $4.2 billion while the cost for these products declined 73 basis points. Partially offsetting the growth in these categories was a decline of $3.3 billion in foreign-office deposits as the strong deposit growth reduced the need for these types of funding sources. Growth in noninterest-bearing deposits was led by commercial accounts, which contributed $3.0 billion of the growth in this category. In addition, noninterest-bearing deposits for retail accounts and public funds grew $646 million and $630 million, respectively. Growth in interest-bearing domestic deposits was also led by commercial accounts, which contributed $13.6 billion of the growth in this category, followed by public funds, which grew $3.0 billion.

Certificates and other time deposits also increased $2.2 billion, or an annualized 28.3%, while cost for these products declined 17 basis points. The increase in deposits was primarily related to commercial accounts, which contributed $1.3 billion of the growth in noninterest-bearing deposits and $4.6 billion of the growth in interest-bearing deposits. Overall the costs of interest-bearing deposits decreased 9 basis points during the fourth quarter of 2011.

Community Banking
     
BB&Ts Community Banking segment serves individual and business clients by offering a variety of loan and deposit products and other financial services. The segment is primarily responsible for acquiring and maintaining client relationships.
     
Net income for the Community Banking segment was $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of $58 million over the fourth quarter of 2010, and a $128 million decrease from the prior quarter. The increase in net income over the same period in 2010 was primarily due to a $342 million decrease in the allocated provision for loan and lease losses, reflecting improved credit quality in the segments commercial and retail loan portfolios. Lower provision expenses were offset by an increase of $129 million in noninterest expense, which was driven by increased writedowns and losses on sales of foreclosed commercial real estate. Net interest income and intersegment net interest income, which includes funds transfer pricing, decreased $48 million driven by lower intersegment credits applied on deposits related to the decline in the liquidity premiums from the prior year. In addition, noninterest income declined by $41 million, primarily due to lower debit card interchange fees. The provision for taxes in the Community Banking segment increased $36 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, due to higher income before taxes.
     
The decrease in net income over the prior quarter was primarily due to a $192 million increase in noninterest expenses, as a result of the $196 million increase in losses on foreclosed property, partially offset by a $76 million decrease in the provision for income taxes.
Residential Mortgage Banking
     
BB&Ts Residential Mortgage Banking segment retains and services mortgage loans originated by the Community Banking segment as well as those purchased from various correspondent originators. Mortgage loan products include fixed and adjustable-rate government and conventional loans for the purpose of constructing, purchasing, or refinancing residential properties. Substantially all of the properties are owner-occupied.
13
     
Residential Mortgage Banking generated net income of $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, a $36 million increase over the fourth quarter of 2010, and a $19 million increase over the prior quarter. The increase in common quarter net income was primarily due to a $70 million decrease in the allocated provision for loan and lease losses as a result of improved credit quality performance in the segments residential mortgage loan portfolio and the sale of problem loans in the second quarter of 2011. Offsetting lower provision expenses was a $14 million increase in noninterest expense and a $4 million decrease in noninterest income. The $14 million increase in noninterest expense was primarily driven by higher loss provisions for mortgage loans sold and higher foreclosure expenses associated with the investor-owned portfolio. The $4 million decrease in noninterest income was primarily the result of higher MSR fair value decay attributed to lower interest rates. In addition, the provision for income taxes was $21 million higher than in the prior year.
     
The increase in net income over the prior quarter was primarily due to a $17 million decrease in the allocated provision for loan and lease losses and a $12 million increase in net interest income and intersegment net interest income, driven by strong linked quarter annualized loan growth. This was offset by a $10 million increase in the provision for income taxes.
Dealer Financial Services
     
BB&Ts Dealer Financial Services segment primarily originates loans to consumers for the purchase of automobiles. These loans are originated on an indirect basis through approved franchised and independent automobile dealers throughout BB&Ts market area and on a national basis through Regional Acceptance Corporation. Dealer Financial Services also originates loans for the purchase of recreational and marine vehicles.
     
Net income for the Dealer Financial Services segment was $48 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of $2 million over the fourth quarter of 2010, and a $10 million decrease from the prior quarter. The increase in net income over the same period in 2010 was primarily due to a $15 million increase in net interest income and intersegment net interest income, as Regional Acceptance Corporation generated higher margins on new originations in its loan portfolio due to lower cost of funding as interest rates have remained low and relatively stable. The allocated provision for loan and lease losses increased $13 million as a result of growth in Regional Acceptance Corporations delinquent accounts and nonperforming assets, which have risen from recent lows to more historical levels.
     
The decrease in net income over the prior quarter was primarily due to an $18 million increase in the allocated provision for loan and lease losses. Provision expense growth was driven by Regional Acceptance Corporation as a result of normal seasonal increases in charge-offs and delinquent account levels.
Specialized Lending
     
BB&Ts Specialized Lending segment consists of businesses that provide specialty finance alternatives to commercial and consumer clients including: commercial finance, mortgage warehouse lending, tax-exempt financing for local governments and special-purpose districts,
14
equipment leasing, full-service commercial mortgage banking, commercial and retail insurance premium finance, dealer-based financing of equipment for consumers and small businesses, and direct consumer finance.
     
Specialized Lending generated net income of $63 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of $9 million over the fourth quarter of 2010 and the prior quarter. The increase in net income over the prior years quarter was primarily due to a $4 million increase in net interest income and intersegment net interest income and a $5 million increase in noninterest income.

BB&Ts insurance agency / brokerage network is the 7th largest in the world. BB&T Insurance Services provides property and casualty, life, and heath insurance to business and individual clients.

l
     
Insurance Services generated net income of $26 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of $1 million over the fourth quarter of 2010 and $16 million above prior quarter results. Despite soft market pricing conditions, insurance revenue performance improved on a linked quarter and year-over-year basis. Growth was primarily driven by McGriff, Seibels, & Williams corporate brokerage platform. BB&T Insurance also closed three acquisitions in the fourth quarter: Precept Group, a full-service employee benefits consulting and administrative solutions firm with offices in Irvine and San Ramon, California; Liberty Benefit Insurance Services, a full-service employee benefits broker located in San Jose, California; and Atlantic Risk Management Corporation, a commercial property and casualty and employee benefits broker located in Columbia, Maryland.
     
The increase in net income over the prior quarter was primarily due to an $18 million increase in noninterest income and an $11 million decrease in noninterest expenses, offset by an $8 million increase in the provision for income taxes. The increase in noninterest income was primarily attributable to seasonality and acquisitions closing in the fourth quarter.

Financial Services generated net income of $84 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of $26 million over the fourth quarter of 2010, and a $10 million increase over the prior quarter. The increase in net income as compared to the same period in 2010 was primarily due to a $24 million increase in net interest income and intersegment net interest income and an $8 million decrease in the allocated provision for loan and lease losses. The higher interest income is captured primarily through the intersegment net interest income due to the significant growth in deposit balances and related interest expense offsetting the increase in interest income associated with the growth in loan balances. Also captured within the net intersegment interest income for Financial Services is the net interest margin for the loans and deposits assigned to the Wealth Management Division that are housed in the Community Bank.
     
The higher loan loss provision in the prior year was driven by record loan growth during the quarter. Driving net interest income and intersegment net interest income increases was Corporate Banking, which generated significant loan portfolio growth through new and expanded client relationships. Corporate Bankings loan growth of 49.8% over the fourth quarter of 2010 was achieved through both geographic expansion and the addition of industry sector expertise.
     
The increase in net income over the prior quarter was primarily due to an $11 million increase in net interest income and intersegment net interest income and a $12 million increase in noninterest income, associated with continued strong linked quarter loan growth in Capital Markets, Corporate Banking and the Wealth Management Division. This income was offset by a $9 million increase in the allocated provision for loan and lease losses.

(1) Current quarter regulatory capital ratios are preliminary.
(2) Tangible common equity and Tier 1 common equity ratios are Non-GAAP measures. BB&T uses the Tier 1 common equity definition used in the SCAP assessment to calculate these ratios. See the calculations and management's reasons for using these measures on page 20 of the Quarterly Performance Summary.
     
BB&Ts capital levels at December 31, 2011 remained strong. The Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio were 12.4% and 9.7%, respectively, compared to 12.6% and 9.8%, respectively, at September 30, 2011. The slight decline in these ratios was largely driven by strong balance sheet growth during the quarter. BB&T declared total dividends of $0.16 during the fourth quarter of 2011. The $0.16 quarterly dividend reflects a dividend payout ratio of 29% for the current quarter.
     
BB&Ts Tier 1 common capital ratio under the currently proposed Basel III capital standards was estimated to be 8.8% at December 31, 2011 unchanged compared to the ratio at September 30, 2011.
 
(1) Excludes amounts related to covered assets and government guaranteed loans. See footnotes related to Credit Quality beginning on page 16 of the Quarterly Performance Summary for additional information.
     
Asset quality improved significantly during the fourth quarter of 2011. Total nonperforming assets decreased $519 million, or 17.5%, compared to September 30, 2011 due to a $408 million
17
decline in foreclosed property. This is the seventh consecutive quarterly decline in nonperforming assets and the amount is the lowest since the fourth quarter of 2008.
     
Total performing troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), excluding loans guaranteed by the government, were $1.1 billion at December 31, 2011, an increase of $42 million, or 3.9%, compared to September 30, 2011. Residential mortgage TDRs represented the majority of the increase compared to September 30, 2011, which was primarily due to a recent related to trial modifications.
regulatory interpretation
     
Loan delinquencies were relatively stable during the fourth quarter of 2011. Loans 30-89 days past due and still accruing, excluding loans guaranteed by the government, totaled $1.1 billion at December 31, 2011, an increase of $75 million compared to September 30, 2011 principally due to normal seasonal increases in retail loans. Loans 90 days past due and still accruing, excluding loans guaranteed by the government, were $202 million at December 31, 2011, an increase of $15 million compared to September 30, 2011.
     
Net charge-offs during the fourth quarter of 2011 were 1.46% of average loans and leases, excluding covered loans, compared to 1.44% during the third quarter of 2011 and 2.15% during the fourth quarter of 2010. Net charge-offs were $393 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, which includes $13 million in charge-offs associated with covered loans.
     
As of December 31, 2011, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 2.05% of total loans and leases held for investment, excluding covered loans, compared to 2.25% at September 30, 2011, and 2.63% at December 31, 2010. The decline in the allowance as a percentage of total loans reflects the improvement in the overall quality of the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan and lease losses was 113% of nonperforming loans and leases held for investment, excluding covered loans, essentially flat compared to 115% at September 30, 2011.
BB&T expands through acquisitions

The agreement excludes nonperforming and other criticized assets and is accretive to earnings per share.

This news release contains financial information and performance measures determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). BB&Ts management uses these non-GAAP measures in their analysis of the corporations performance. BB&Ts management uses these measures to evaluate the underlying performance and efficiency of its operations. It believes that these non-GAAP measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of results with prior periods as well as demonstrating the effects of significant gains and charges in the current period. The company believes that a meaningful analysis of its financial performance requires an understanding of the factors underlying that performance. BB&Ts management believes that investors may use these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze financial performance without the impact of unusual items that may obscure trends in the companys underlying performance. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Tangible common equity and Tier 1 common equity ratios are non-GAAP measures. BB&T uses the Tier 1 common equity definition used in the SCAP assessment to calculate these ratios. BB&T's management uses these measures to assess the quality of capital and believes that investors may find them useful in their analysis of the corporation. These capital measures are not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures that may be presented by other companies. Asset quality ratios have been adjusted to remove the impact of acquired loans and foreclosed property covered by the FDIC loss sharing agreements as management believes their inclusion results in distortion of those ratios and may not be comparable to other periods presented or to other portfolios that were not impacted by purchase accounting.
