FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
BB&T increases dividend 25%
Declares 4-cent quarterly increase per share for 2012
     
WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.
 The board of directors of BB&T Corporation (NYSE: BBT) today declared a 2012 second-quarter dividend of $0.20 per share, a 4-cent increase from the $0.16 dividend previously announced for the second quarter on Feb. 21, and from the dividend paid in the first quarter. At this quarterly rate, the annual dividend is equivalent to $0.80 per common share. The $0.20 dividend represents a 25% increase over last years quarterly dividend.
     
After a review of BB&Ts 2012 capital plan and projections under a hypothetical economic scenario that is more adverse than actually expected, the Federal Reserve today did not object to any of BB&Ts requests related to capital actions in 2012. BB&Ts performance was among industry leaders in recent years, as BB&T did not report a net loss in any quarter during the economic downturn, maintaining strong levels of capital and liquidity.
     
We are pleased to provide this substantial dividend increase to our shareholders and are committed to a robust dividend payout, said Chairman and CEO Kelly S. King. We continue to be one of the strongest capitalized institutions in the industry and believe our 2012 capital actions confirm that strength and our commitment to our shareholders. BB&T also remains among industry leaders in dividend yield among S&P 500 banks.
     
The Federal Reserve also did not object to BB&Ts plans to redeem $3.2 billion of trust preferred securities beginning in 2012 without issuing any replacement capital. BB&T has also successfully deployed capital in 2012 through the planned acquisitions of BankAtlantic, which will add $2.1 billion in loans and $3.3 billion in core low-cost deposits, and Crump Insurance, which will add $300 million in noninterest revenues in its first full year following the acquisition. These transactions are both accretive to BB&Ts earnings, creating shareholder value.

The dividend will be paid May 1, 2012, to shareholders of record as of April 9, 2012. BB&T has one of the strongest dividend payouts in the country for banks and has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1903. The company has approximately 697 million shares outstanding.
