On April 2, 2012, BB&T Corporation (BB&T) submitted redemption notices to the property trustee for each trust listed below, which will result in the redemption of the trust preferred securities identified in the table below on the redemption date specified for each security. Each series of trust preferred securities is currently callable and the redemptions are being undertaken at the option of BB&T. Under applicable regulatory capital guidelines issued by bank regulatory agencies, upon notice of redemption, these trust preferred securities will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital for BB&T. These redemptions are consistent with the capital plan BB&T submitted to the Federal Reserve Board, and will be funded by general corporate reserves.
 
     
The holders of trust preferred securities of Mason-Dixon Capital Trust and MainStreet Capital Trust I will receive 103.021% and 102.670% of the principal amounts, respectively. The trust preferred securities of Premier Capital Trust I will be redeemed at 100% of the principal amount per security, which will be equal to the liquidation amount of $25 per trust preferred security, plus accrued and unpaid distributions to the redemption date.
