ITEM 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On February 21, 2012 the Compensation Committee (the Compensation Committee) of the Board of Directors of BB&T Corporation (BB&T or the Company) approved the BB&T Corporation 2012 Incentive Plan (the 2012 Plan), subject to the approval of the 2012 Plan by the shareholders at the Companys Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 24, 2012 (the Annual Meeting). As described in further detail below under Item 5.07, the 2012 Plan was approved by shareholders at the Annual Meeting. Participants in the 2012 Plan will include BB&Ts Executive Management team, which is the Companys top level of management and includes Kelly S. King, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and each of other Named Executive Officers included in the Summary Compensation Table in the Companys proxy statement for the Annual Meeting (the 2012 Proxy). For a description of the terms and conditions of the 2012 Plan, please refer to the section of the 2012 Proxy entitled PROPOSAL 2APPROVAL OF 2012 INCENTIVE PLAN, which section is incorporated herein by reference. The 2012 Proxy was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 12, 2012.
the
Also on February 21, 2012 and pursuant to the 2012 Plan, the Compensation Committee approved the Companys 2012 Annual Incentive Performance Awards (each, an Annual Incentive Award). Recipients of Annual Incentive Awards include Mr. King and each of the other Named Executive Officers. Annual Incentive Awards are cash awards to the Named Executive Officers and other key employees that are based on the achievement of performance goals established annually by the Compensation Committee. The 2012 Plan and the Annual Incentive Awards will replace the BB&T Corporation Short-Term Incentive Plan, or STIP awards. For 2012, the principal changes to the Annual Incentive Awards relative to prior year STIP awards are that (a) for return on assets purposes (i) BB&Ts performance will now be measured against its peer group on a current period basis and (ii) the awards will fund within a band of performance, subject to adjustment within the band at the Compensation Committees discretion and (b) for officers who are covered employees as determined by Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 162(m)), the awards will be paid out of a pool equal to 1.5% of BB&Ts 2012 pre-tax income. For a discussion of the 2011 STIP awards, please refer to the 2012 Proxy.
The size of each participants Annual Incentive Award is determined by establishing a target incentive award expressed as a percentage of the individuals base salary up to a maximum amount established by the Compensation Committee. Consistent with prior STIP awards, the Compensation Committee established corporate performance goals for the 2012 Annual Incentive Awards based on earnings per share (weighted at 66.7%) and return on assets (weighted at 33.3%). The earnings per share (EPS) performance target for the Annual Incentive Awards was generally established based on internal earnings expectations, with the threshold and maximum levels being 20% below and above, respectively, the target. Return on assets performance will be based on BB&Ts return on assets (ROA) relative to the ROA achieved by each company of its Peer Group (for these purposes, BB&Ts Peer Group consists of Comerica, Fifth Third, Huntington, KeyCorp, M&T, PNC, Regions, SunTrust, US Bancorp and Zions). In recent years, the STIP ROA performance metrics were established at the beginning of the annual performance period, based on the peer group ROA results for the most recently completed year, with BB&Ts ROA performance measured at the end of the awards annual performance period against such previously established peer group performance metrics. For the 2012 Annual Incentive Awards, the ROA component is based on BB&Ts ROA results for 2012 relative to the ROA of the Peer Group for the same annual period. See the table below for further illustration.
The 2012 Annual Incentive Awards are also different from prior years STIP awards with respect to the funding of the ROA component. Previously, the ROA component of STIP awards was earned and paid on a sliding scale, based on BB&Ts actual ROA performance against the previously established goals. As described in the table below, BB&Ts ROA performance as compared to the Peer Group will cause the ROA component of the 2012 Annual Incentive Awards to be funded (if at all) within the threshold, target or maximum level, subject to the Compensation Committees discretion to determine funding within such band of performance.
 
For 2012, BB&Ts officers who are covered employees as determined by Section 162(m) are Messrs. King, Henson, Brown and Starnes (the Covered Employees). Each of the Covered Employees is a Named Executive Officer (Mr. Bible, as BB&Ts Chief Financial Officer, is not a Covered Employee). The Annual Incentive Awards for the Covered Employees will be paid from a pool equal to 1.5% of BB&Ts 2012 income before taxes (pre-tax income) (the 162(m) Incentive Pool), pursuant to a percentage thereof assigned to each Covered Employee, subject to caps on the size of individual payments, and based upon payment targets and the achievement of performance goals (for 2012, the EPS and ROA performance goals discussed above) established by the Compensation Committee within 90 days of the beginning of the performance period. The Compensation Committee can exercise negative discretion (but not upward discretion) in determining the actual payment amounts to the Covered Employees.
As a result of payouts under the 2012 Plan, including the 2012 Annual Incentive Awards, being determined based upon the future performance of BB&T and its Peer Group, amounts payable under such arrangements are not determinable at this time.
