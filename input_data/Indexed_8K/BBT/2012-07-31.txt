(d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in Section 9 is for any reason held to be unavailable in accordance with its terms, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the Company and the Underwriters with respect to the Shares that were the subject of the claim for indemnification in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Shares as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if Underwriters failed to give the notice required under Section 9(c) hereof, then the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute to such aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such liabilities, claims, damages and expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity
 
to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 9(d) were determined pro rata (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation, which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9(d). The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 9(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9(d), the Underwriters shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares referred to in the second sentence of this Section 9(d) that were offered and sold to the public through the Underwriters exceeds the amount of any damages that the Underwriters have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled under this Section 9(d) to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 9(d), each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each Underwriter's Affiliates and selling agents shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each of the directors of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9(d) are several in proportion to the principal amount of Shares set forth opposite their respective names in hereto and not joint.

(a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Shares which it has agreed to purchase hereunder at a Time of Delivery, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for the Representatives or another party or other parties to purchase such Shares on the terms contained herein. If within 36 hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Shares, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Shares on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, the Representatives notify the Company that the Representatives have so arranged for the purchase of such Shares, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Shares, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone such Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the Representatives' opinion may thereby be made necessary.

(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Shares which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate number of all the Shares to be purchased at such Time of Delivery, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement (or, with respect to the Second Time of Delivery, the obligations of the Underwriters to purchase and of the Company to sell the Optional Shares) shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Shares.
12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, any the Shares are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out of pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Shares not so delivered, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
13. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representatives.
 
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the Representatives as the representatives at the addresses of the respective representatives in hereto; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to 200 West Second Street, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27101, attention of Robert J.

The election of the Preferred Directors will take place at any annual meeting of shareholders or any special meeting of the holders of Series E Preferred Stock and any other class or series of the Corporation's stock that ranks on parity with Series E Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and for which dividends have not been paid, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(c)(i) above, the secretary of the Corporation may, and upon the written request of any holder of Series E Preferred Stock (addressed to the secretary at the Corporation's principal office) must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the shareholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of shareholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series E Preferred Stock, and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series E Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and for which dividends have not been paid, for the election of the two directors to be elected by them as provided in Section 7(c)(iii) below. The Preferred Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter.
(ii) Election.
Notice for a special meeting will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Corporation's by-laws for a special meeting of the shareholders. If the secretary of the Corporation does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any holder of Series E Preferred Stock may (at the Corporation's expense) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(c)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Corporation. The Preferred Directors elected at any such special meeting will hold office until the next annual meeting of the Corporation's shareholders unless they have been previously terminated or removed pursuant to Section 7(c)(iv). In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by the vote of the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock (together with
(iii) Notice for Special Meeting.
 
holders of any other class of the Corporation's authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) to serve until the next annual meeting of the shareholders.
,
Whenever full dividends have been paid regularly on the Series E Preferred Stock and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series E Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, if any, for at least four consecutive Dividend Periods, then the right of the holders of Series E Preferred Stock to elect such additional two directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods). The terms of office of the Preferred Directors will immediately terminate and the number of directors constituting the Corporation's board of directors will be reduced accordingly. Any Preferred Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Corporation's authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) when they have the voting rights described in this Section 7(c).
(iv) Termination; Removal.
,
The holders of Series E Preferred Stock shall not have any rights to convert such Series E Preferred Stock into shares of any other class of capital stock of the Corporation.
Section 8. Conversion.
Notwithstanding anything set forth in the articles of incorporation or these Articles of Amendment to the contrary, the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, without the vote of the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock, may authorize and issue additional shares of Junior Stock, Parity Stock or, subject to the voting rights granted in Section 7(b), any class of securities ranking senior to the Series E Preferred Stock as to dividends and the distribution of assets upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.
Section 9. Rank.
Subject to the limitations imposed herein, the Corporation may purchase and sell Series E Preferred Stock from time to time to such extent, in such manner, and upon such terms as the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation may determine; , , that the Corporation shall not use any of its funds for any such purchase when there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Corporation is, or by such purchase would be, rendered insolvent.
Section 10. Repurchase.
provided
however
Shares of Series E Preferred Stock not issued or which have been issued and converted, redeemed or otherwise purchased or acquired by the Corporation shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock without designation as to series.
Section 11. Unissued or Reacquired Shares.
 
Shares of Series E Preferred Stock are not subject to the operation of a sinking fund.
Section 12. No Sinking Fund.
3. The amendment to the articles of incorporation contained herein was duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation on June 26, 2012 and the Executive and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation on June 26, 2012 and July 24, 2012.
4. The amendment to the articles of incorporation contained herein does not require shareholder approval pursuant to Section 55-6-02 of the North Carolina Business Corporation Act because it creates a new series of shares of a class that has no outstanding shares and does not affect a series of a class of shares in one or more of the ways described in Section 55-10-04 of the North Carolina Business Corporation Act.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, BB&T Corporation has caused these Articles of Amendment to be signed by Hal S. Johnson, its Executive Vice President and Treasurer, this 24 day of July, 2012.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, the Corporation may from time to time deposit shares of Series E Preferred Stock under this Deposit Agreement by delivery to the Depositary of a certificate or certificates for such shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be deposited, properly endorsed or accompanied, if required by the Depositary, by a duly executed instrument of transfer or endorsement, in form satisfactory to the Depositary, together with all such certifications as may be required by the Depositary in accordance with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement and an executed Officer's Certificate attaching the Articles of Amendment and all other information required to be set forth therein, and together with a written order of the Corporation directing the Depositary to execute and deliver to, or upon the written order of, the person or persons stated in such order a Receipt or Receipts evidencing in the aggregate the number of Depositary Shares representing such deposited Series E Preferred Stock.

Upon surrender of a Receipt or Receipts at the Depositary's Office or at such other offices as it may designate for the purpose of effecting a split-up or combination of such Receipt or Receipts, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary shall execute a new Receipt or Receipts in the authorized denomination or denominations requested, evidencing the aggregate number of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipt or Receipts surrendered, and shall deliver such new Receipt or Receipts to or upon the order of the Holder of the Receipt or Receipts so surrendered.
Any Holder of a Receipt or Receipts may withdraw the number of whole shares of Series E Preferred Stock and all money and other property, if any, represented thereby by surrendering such Receipt or Receipts at the Depositary's Office or at such other offices as the Depositary may designate for such withdrawals. Thereafter, without unreasonable delay, the Depositary shall deliver to such Holder, or to the person or persons designated by such Holder as hereinafter provided, the number of whole shares of Series E Preferred Stock and all money and other property, if any, represented by the Receipt or Receipts so surrendered for withdrawal, but Holders of such whole shares of Series E Preferred Stock will not thereafter be entitled to deposit such Series E Preferred Stock hereunder or to receive a Receipt evidencing Depositary Shares therefor. If a Receipt delivered by the Holder to the Depositary in connection with such withdrawal shall evidence a number of Depositary Shares in excess of the number of Depositary Shares representing the number of whole shares of Series E Preferred Stock, Depositary shall at the same time, in addition to such number of whole shares of Series E Preferred Stock and such money and other property, if any, to be so withdrawn, deliver to such Holder, or subject to Section 2.3 upon his order, a new Receipt evidencing such excess number of Depositary Shares.
In no event will fractional shares of Series E Preferred Stock (or any cash payment in lieu thereof) be delivered by the Depositary. Delivery of the Series E Preferred Stock and money and other property, if any, being withdrawn may be made by the delivery of such certificates, documents of title and other instruments as the Depositary may deem appropriate.
If the Series E Preferred Stock and the money and other property, if any, being withdrawn are to be delivered to a person or persons other than the Record Holder of the related Receipt or Receipts being surrendered for withdrawal of such Series E Preferred Stock, such
 
Table of Contents
Holder shall execute and deliver to the Depositary a written order so directing the Depositary and the Depositary may require that the Receipt or Receipts surrendered by such Holder for withdrawal of such shares of Series E Preferred Stock be properly endorsed in blank or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer in blank.
Delivery of the Series E Preferred Stock and the money and other property, if any, represented by Receipts surrendered for withdrawal shall be made by the Depositary at the Depositary's Office, except that, at the request, risk and expense of the Holder surrendering such Receipt or Receipts and for the account of the Holder thereof, such delivery may be made at such other place as may be designated by such Holder.
Section 2.5. Limitations on Execution and Delivery, Transfer, Surrender and Exchange of Receipts.
As a condition precedent to the execution and delivery, registration of transfer, split-up, combination, surrender or exchange of any Receipt, the Depositary, any of the Depositary's Agents or the Corporation may require payment to it of a sum sufficient for the payment (or, in the event that the Depositary or the Corporation shall have made such payment, the reimbursement to it) of any charges or expenses payable by the Holder of a Receipt pursuant to Section 5.7, may require the production of evidence satisfactory to it as to the identity and genuineness of any signature (which evidence may include a signature guarantee from an eligible guarantor institution participating in a signature guarantee program approved by the Securities Transfer Association), and any other reasonable evidence of authority that may be required by the Depositary, and may also require compliance with such regulations, if any, as the Depositary or the Corporation may establish consistent with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement and/or applicable law.
The deposit of the Series E Preferred Stock may be refused, the delivery of Receipts against Series E Preferred Stock may be suspended, the registration of transfer of Receipts may be refused and the registration of transfer, surrender or exchange of outstanding Receipts may be suspended (i) during any period when the register of stockholders of the Corporation is closed or (ii) if any such action is deemed necessary or advisable by the Depositary, any of the Depositary's Agents or the Corporation at any time or from time to time because of any requirement of law or of any government or governmental body or commission or under any provision of this Deposit Agreement.
Section 2.6. Lost Receipts, etc.
In case any Receipt shall be mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen, the Depositary in its discretion may execute and deliver a Receipt of like form and tenor in exchange and substitution for such mutilated Receipt, or in lieu of and in substitution for such destroyed, lost or stolen Receipt, upon (i) the filing by the Holder thereof with the Depositary of evidence satisfactory to the Depositary of such destruction or loss or theft of such Receipt, of the authenticity thereof and of his or her ownership thereof and (ii) the Holder thereof furnishing of the Depositary with an affidavit and an indemnity or bond reasonably satisfactory to the Depositary. Such Holder shall also comply with such other reasonable regulations and pay such other
 
Table of Contents
reasonable charges as the Depositary may prescribe and as required by Section 8-405 of the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in the State of New York.
Section 2.7. Cancellation and Destruction of Surrendered Receipts.
All Receipts surrendered to the Depositary or any Depositary's Agent shall be cancelled by the Depositary. Except as prohibited by applicable law or regulation, the Depositary is authorized and directed to destroy all Receipts so cancelled.
Section 2.8. Redemption of Series E Preferred Stock.
Whenever the Corporation shall be permitted and shall elect to redeem shares of Series E Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms of the Articles of Amendment, it shall (unless otherwise agreed to in writing with the Depositary) give or cause to be given to the Depositary, not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date (as defined below), notice of the date of such proposed redemption of Series E Preferred Stock and of the number of such shares held by the Depositary to be so redeemed and the applicable redemption price, which notice shall be accompanied by a certificate from the Corporation stating that such redemption of Series E Preferred Stock is in accordance with the provisions of the Articles of Amendment. On the date of such redemption, provided that the Corporation shall then have paid or caused to be paid in full to the Depositary the Redemption Price (as such term is defined in the Articles of Amendment) of the Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed, in accordance with the provisions of the Articles of Amendment, the Depositary shall redeem the number of Depositary Shares representing such Series E Preferred Stock. Notice of the Corporation's redemption of Series E Preferred Stock and the proposed simultaneous redemption of the number of Depositary Shares representing the Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be (1) mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at the respective last addresses as they appear on the records of the Depositary, or (2) transmitted by such other method approved by the Depositary, in its reasonable discretion, in either case not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption of such Series E Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares (the "Redemption Date"), to the Record Holders of the Receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares to be so redeemed; but neither failure to mail or transmit any such notice of redemption of Depositary Shares to one or more such Holders nor any defect in any notice of redemption of Depositary Shares to one or more such Holders shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for redemption as to the other Holders. Each such notice shall be prepared by the Corporation and shall state: (i) the Redemption Date; (ii) the number of Depositary Shares to be redeemed and, if less than all the Depositary Shares held by any such Holder are to be redeemed, the number of such Depositary Shares held by such Holder to be so redeemed; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends in respect of the Series E Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such Redemption Date. In case less than all the outstanding Depositary Shares are to be redeemed, the Depositary Shares to be so redeemed shall be selected either pro rata or by lot or in such other manner as the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation may determine to be fair and equitable.

If fewer than all of the Depositary Shares evidenced by a Receipt are called for redemption, the Depositary will deliver to the Holder of such Receipt upon its surrender to the Depositary, together with the redemption payment, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares evidenced by such prior Receipt and not called for redemption.
Section 3.1. Filing Proofs, Articles of Amendments and Other Information.
Any Holder of a Receipt may be required from time to time to file such proof of residence, or other matters or other information, to execute such certificates and to make such representations and warranties as the Depositary or the Corporation may reasonably deem necessary or proper. The Depositary or the Corporation may withhold the delivery, or delay the registration of transfer or redemption, of any Receipt or the withdrawal of the Series E Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares and evidenced by a Receipt or the distribution of any dividend or other distribution or the sale of any rights or of the proceeds thereof until such proof or other information is filed or such certificates are executed or such representations and warranties are made.
Section 3.2. Payment of Taxes or Other Governmental Charges.

attempting by reasonable means to notify such Holder prior to such sale), and such dividends, interest payments or other distributions or the proceeds of any such sale may be applied to any payment of such charges or expenses, the Holder of such Receipt remaining liable for any deficiency.
Section 3.3. Warranty as to Series E Preferred Stock.

The Corporation hereby represents and warrants that the Receipts, when issued, will represent legal and valid interests in the Series E Preferred Stock. Such representation and warranty shall survive the deposit of the Series E Preferred Stock and the issuance of the Receipts.
Section 4.1. Cash Distributions.
Whenever Computershare shall receive any cash dividend or other cash distribution on the Series E Preferred Stock, Computershare shall, subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, distribute to Record Holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.4 such amounts of such dividend or distribution as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such Holders; provided, however, that in case the Corporation or Computershare shall be required to withhold and shall withhold from any cash dividend or other cash distribution in respect of the Series E Preferred Stock an amount on account of taxes, the amount made available for distribution or distributed in respect of Depositary Shares shall be reduced accordingly. Computershare shall distribute or make available for distribution, as the case may be, only such amount, however, as can be distributed without attributing to any Holder of Receipts a fraction of one cent, and any balance not so distributable shall be held by Computershare (without liability for interest thereon) and shall be added to and be treated as part of the next sum received by Computershare for distribution to Record Holders of Receipts then outstanding. Each Holder of a Receipt shall provide Computershare with its certified tax identification number on a properly completed Form W-8 or W-9, as may be applicable. Each Holder of a Receipt acknowledges that, in the event of non-compliance with the preceding sentence, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, may require withholding by Computershare of a portion of any of the distributions to be made hereunder.
The Corporation acknowledges that the bank accounts maintained by Computershare in connection with the services provided under this Agreement will be in Computershare's name and that Computershare may receive investment earnings in connection with the investment at Computershare's risk and for its benefit of funds held in those accounts from time to time. Neither the Corporation nor the record holders will receive interest on any deposits or funds held by Computershare hereunder.

Section 4.2. Distributions Other than Cash, Rights, Preferences or Privileges.
Whenever the Depositary shall receive any distribution other than cash, rights, preferences or privileges upon the Series E Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall, subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, distribute to Record Holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.4 such amounts of the securities or property received by it as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipts held by such Holders, in any manner that the Depositary may deem equitable and practicable for accomplishing such distribution. If in the opinion of the Depositary such distribution cannot be made proportionately among such Record Holders, or if for any other reason (including any requirement that the Corporation or the Depositary withhold an amount on account of taxes) the Depositary deems, after consultation with the Corporation, such distribution not to be feasible, the Depositary may, with the approval of the Corporation, adopt such method as it deems equitable and practicable for the purpose of effecting such distribution, including the sale (at public or private sale) of the securities or property thus received, or any part thereof, in a commercially reasonable manner. The net proceeds of any such sale shall, subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, be distributed or made available for distribution, as the case may be, by the Depositary to Record Holders of Receipts as provided by Section 4.1 in the case of a distribution received in cash. The Corporation shall not make any distribution of such securities or property to the Depositary and the Depositary shall not make any distribution of such securities or property to the Holders of Receipts unless the Corporation shall have provided an opinion of counsel stating that such securities or property have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered in connection with such distributions.
Section 4.3. Subscription Rights, Preferences or Privileges.
If the Corporation shall at any time offer or cause to be offered to the persons in whose names the Series E Preferred Stock is recorded on the books of the Corporation any rights, preferences or privileges to subscribe for or to purchase any securities or any rights, preferences or privileges of any other nature, such rights, preferences or privileges shall in each such instance be made available by the Depositary to the Record Holders of Receipts in such manner as the Corporation shall direct and the Depositary shall agree, either by the issue to such Record Holders of warrants representing such rights, preferences or privileges or by such other method as may be approved by the Corporation in its discretion with the acknowledgement of the Depositary; provided, however, that (i) if at the time of issue or offer of any such rights, preferences or privileges the Corporation determines that it is not lawful or (after consultation with the Depositary) not feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges available to Holders of Receipts by the issue of warrants or otherwise, or (ii) if and to the extent so instructed by Holders of Receipts who do not desire to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges, then the Corporation, in its discretion (with acknowledgement of the Depositary, in any case where the Corporation has determined that it is not feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges available), may, if applicable laws or the terms of such rights, preferences or privileges permit such transfer, sell such rights, preferences or privileges at public or private sale, at such place or places and upon such terms as it may deem proper. The net proceeds of any such sale shall, subject
 
Table of Contents
to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, be distributed by the Depositary to the Record Holders of Receipts entitled thereto as provided by Section 4.1 in the case of a distribution received in cash.
The Corporation shall notify the Depositary whether registration under the Securities Act of the securities to which any rights, preferences or privileges relate is required in order for Holders of Receipts to be offered or sold the securities to which such rights, preferences or privileges relate, and the Corporation agrees with the Depositary that it will file promptly a registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act with respect to such rights, preferences or privileges and securities and use its best efforts and take all steps available to it to cause such registration statement to become effective sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such Holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges. In no event shall the Depositary make available to the Holders of Receipts any right, preference or privilege to subscribe for or to purchase any securities unless and until such registration statement shall have become effective, or the Corporation shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel to the effect that the offering and sale of such securities to the Holders are exempt from registration under the provisions of the Securities Act.
The Corporation shall notify the Depositary whether any other action under the laws of any jurisdiction or any governmental or administrative authorization, consent or permit is required in order for such rights, preferences or privileges to be made available to Holders of Receipts, and the Corporation agrees with the Depositary that the Corporation will use its reasonable best efforts to take such action or obtain such authorization, consent or permit sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such Holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges.
Section 4.4. Notice of Dividends, etc.; Fixing Record Date for Holders of Receipts.
Whenever any cash dividend or other cash distribution shall become payable or any distribution other than cash shall be made, or if rights, preferences or privileges shall at any time be offered, with respect to the Series E Preferred Stock, or whenever the Depositary shall receive notice of any meeting at which holders of the Series E Preferred Stock are entitled to vote or of which holders of the Series E Preferred Stock are entitled to notice, or whenever the Depositary and the Corporation shall decide it is appropriate, the Depositary shall in each such instance fix a record date (which shall be the same date as the record date fixed by the Corporation with respect to or otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Series E Preferred Stock) for the determination of the Holders of Receipts who shall be entitled to receive such dividend, distribution, rights, preferences or privileges or the net proceeds of the sale thereof, or to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at any such meeting, or who shall be entitled to notice of such meeting or for any other appropriate reasons.
Section 4.5. Voting Rights.
Subject to the provisions of the Articles of Amendment, upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the Depositary shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail or transmit by such other method approved by the Depositary, in its reasonable discretion, to the Record Holders of Receipts a notice prepared
 
Table of Contents
by the Corporation which shall contain (i) such information as is contained in such notice of meeting and (ii) a statement that the Holders may, subject to any applicable restrictions, instruct the Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the amount of Series E Preferred Stock represented by their respective Depositary Shares (including an express indication that instructions may be given to the Depositary to give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by the Corporation) and a brief statement as to the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of the Holders of Receipts on the relevant record date, the Depositary shall endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such requests, the maximum number of whole shares of Series E Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by all Receipts as to which any particular voting instructions are received. The Corporation hereby agrees to take all reasonable action which may be deemed necessary by the Depositary in order to enable the Depositary to vote such Series E Preferred Stock or cause such Series E Preferred Stock to be voted. In the absence of specific instructions from Holders of Receipts, the Depositary will vote the Series E Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts of such Holders proportionately with votes cast pursuant to instructions received from the other Holders.
Section 4.6. Changes Affecting Deposited Securities and Reclassifications, Recapitalizations, etc.
Upon any change in par or stated value, split-up, combination or any other reclassification of the Series E Preferred Stock, subject to the provisions of the Articles of Amendment, or upon any recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation affecting the Corporation or to which it is a party, the Corporation may, in its discretion and with the acknowledgement of the Depositary, (i) make such adjustments as are certified by the Corporation in the fraction of an interest represented by one Depositary Share in one share of Series E Preferred Stock and in the ratio of the redemption price per Depositary Share to the Redemption Price (as such term is defined in the Articles of Amendment) per share of Series E Preferred Stock, in each case as may be necessary fully to reflect the effects of such change in par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of the Series E Preferred Stock, or of such recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation and (ii) treat any securities which shall be received by the Depositary in exchange for or upon conversion of or in respect of the Series E Preferred Stock as new deposited securities so received in exchange for or upon conversion or in respect of such Series E Preferred Stock. In any such case, the Corporation may, in its discretion and with the acknowledgement of the Depositary, execute and deliver additional Receipts or may call for the surrender of all outstanding Receipts to be exchanged for new Receipts specifically describing such new deposited securities. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, Holders of Receipts shall have the right from and after the effective date of any such change in par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of the Series E Preferred Stock or any such recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation to surrender such Receipts to the Depositary with instructions to convert, exchange or surrender the Series E Preferred Stock represented thereby only into or for, as the case may be, the kind and amount of shares and other securities and property and cash into which the Series E Preferred Stock represented by such Receipts might have been converted or for which such Series E Preferred Stock might have been exchanged or surrendered immediately prior to the effective date of such transaction.

If, at the request of a Holder of Receipts, the Depositary incurs charges or expenses for which the Corporation is not otherwise liable hereunder, such Holder will be liable for such charges and expenses; provided, however, that the Depositary may, at its sole option, require a Holder of a Receipt to prepay the Depositary any charge or expense the Depositary has been asked to incur at the request of such Holder of Receipts. The Depositary shall present its statement for charges and expenses to the Corporation at such intervals as the Corporation and the Depositary may agree using the Ariba invoicing system (or using such other system or means of presenting statements for charges and expenses as the Corporation and the Depositary may mutually agree from time to time hereafter).
Section 6.1. Amendment.
The form of the Receipts and any provisions of this Deposit Agreement may at any time and from time to time be amended by agreement between the Corporation and the Depositary in any respect which they may deem necessary or desirable; provided, however, that no such amendment which shall materially and adversely alter the rights of the Holders of Receipts shall be effective against the Holders of Receipts unless such amendment shall have been approved by the

Every Holder of an outstanding Receipt at the time any such amendment becomes effective shall be deemed, by continuing to hold such Receipt, to consent and agree to such amendment and to be bound by the Depositary Agreement as amended thereby. In no event shall any amendment impair the right, subject to the provisions of Sections 2.5 and 2.6 and Article III, of any owner of Depositary Shares to surrender any Receipt evidencing such Depositary Shares to the Depositary with instructions to deliver to the Holder the Series E Preferred Stock and all money and other property, if any, represented thereby, except in order to comply with mandatory provisions of applicable law or the rules and regulations of any governmental body, agency or commission, or applicable securities exchange.

Upon the termination of this Deposit Agreement, the Corporation shall be discharged from all obligations under this Deposit Agreement except for its obligations to the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent and any Registrar under Sections 5.6 and 5.7 (including as to any services of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent and any Registrar that are necessary following and in connection with the termination of this Deposit Agreement); provided further that Section 5.3, 5.6, 7.4, 7.7 and 7.10 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

In connection with such review, I have assumed (i) the genuineness of all signatures and the legal competence of all signatories; (ii) the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, and the conformity to authentic originals of all documents submitted to me as certified or photostatic copies; (iii) the legal capacity for all purposes relevant hereto of all natural persons and, with respect to all parties to agreements or instruments relevant hereto other than the Company, that such parties had the requisite power and authority (corporate or otherwise) to execute, deliver and perform such agreements or instruments, that such agreements or instruments have been duly authorized by all requisite action (corporate or otherwise), executed and delivered by such parties and that such agreements or instruments are the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of such parties; and (iv) the proper issuance and accuracy of certificates of public officials and officers and agents of the Company.
This opinion is limited to the laws of the State of North Carolina, excluding local laws of the State of North Carolina (i.e., the statutes and ordinances, the administrative decisions and the rules and regulations of counties, towns, municipalities and special political subdivisions of, or authorities or quasi-governmental bodies constituted under the laws of, the State of North Carolina and judicial decisions to the extent they deal with any of the foregoing) and the laws of the United States of America that are, in my experience, normally applicable to the transactions of the type provided for in the Registration Statement, and I am expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing and the qualifications set forth below, I am of the opinion that (i) the shares of Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares have been duly authorized and, when issued and sold in accordance with the terms of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and (ii) the Depositary Shares have been duly authorized and, when issued and sold in accordance with the terms of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and the holders of the Depositary Shares will be entitled to the rights specified in the Deposit Agreement.
