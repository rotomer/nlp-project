4.
Special Meetings
: Special meetings of the shareholders may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Chief Operating Officer, the Secretary or the Board of Directors of the corporation.
     5.
Notice of Meetings
:
     
(a) Written, printed or electronically transmitted notice of a meeting stating the date, time and place of the meeting shall be delivered to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting not fewer than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date thereof, by or at the
direction of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Chief Operating Officer, the Secretary or the Board of Directors.
     
(b) In case of an annual or substitute annual meeting, the notice of meeting need not specifically state the business to be transacted at the meeting, unless a description of the matter is required by the provisions of applicable law. In the case of a special meeting, the notice of meeting shall specifically state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.
     
(c) When a meeting is adjourned for 120 days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting.

6.
Voting Groups
: All shares of one or more classes or series that under the articles of incorporation or the North Carolina Business Corporation Act are entitled to vote and be counted together collectively on a matter at a meeting of shareholders constitute a voting group. All shares entitled by the articles of incorporation or the North Carolina Business Corporation Act to vote generally on a matter are for that purpose a single voting group. Classes or series of shares shall not be entitled to vote separately by voting group unless authorized pursuant to the articles of incorporation or specifically required by applicable law.

: Shares entitled to vote as a separate voting group may take action on a matter at a meeting only if a quorum of that voting group exists with respect to that matter. Unless otherwise required by the North Carolina Business Corporation Act, the articles of incorporation or a bylaw adopted by the shareholders, a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on a matter by the voting group constitutes a quorum of that voting group for action on that matter. Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for that adjourned meeting. If there is no quorum at the opening of a meeting of shareholders, such meeting may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the votes cast on the motion to adjourn; and at any adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting. The shareholders at a meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum.
     8.
Voting of Shares
:
     
(a) Subject to any restrictions imposed pursuant to the articles of incorporation or applicable law, each outstanding share having voting rights, regardless of class, shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of shareholders.
     
(b) If a quorum exists, action on a matter (other than the election of directors) by a voting group is approved if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless a greater number of affirmative votes is required by the North Carolina Business Corporation Act or by the articles of incorporation or a bylaw adopted
2
by the shareholders. Voting on all matters properly presented at a meeting shall be by voice vote, unless the chairman of the meeting determines otherwise.
     
9.
Proxies
: Shares may be voted either in person or by one or more proxies authorized by a written appointment of proxy signed by the shareholder or his or her duly authorized attorney-in-fact. In addition, (i) an appointment in the form of an electronic record that bears the shareholder's electronic signature and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by an automated process shall be deemed a valid appointment form, and (ii) the corporation may permit a shareholder to appoint one or more proxies by any kind of telephonic transmission, even if not accompanied by written communication, under circumstances or together with information from which the corporation can reasonably assume that the appointment was made or authorized by the shareholder. An appointment of proxy is valid for 11 months from the date of its execution, unless a different period is expressly provided in the appointment form.
     10.

Within 10 days of a request by the corporation, a shareholder nominating a candidate for election as a director of the corporation must also deliver to the corporation any additional information reasonably requested by the corporation concerning the shareholder or the nominee for election as a director of the corporation as would be required, pursuant to applicable law, to be disclosed in the proxy materials concerning all persons nominated (by the corporation or otherwise) for election as a director of the corporation, whether or not the nominee is to be included in the corporations proxy statement. The corporation may also require, within 10 days of a request by the corporation, any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may be reasonably required by the corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the corporation or a member of any committee of the Board of Directors, or that could be material to a reasonable shareholders understanding of the qualifications or independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee.

All non-employee directors will be expected to meet this ownership requirement by the later of (i) five years following the adoption of these guidelines or the initial election of the director, or (ii) such period of time as it may take for the director to reach the ownership requirement threshold by continuously holding those shares or restricted stock units granted by the corporation pursuant to its director equity compensation arrangements.

     1.
Certificates for Shares and Stock Transfer Records
:
     
(a) The Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of some or all of the shares of the corporation's classes or series without issuing certificates to represent such shares. If shares are represented by certificates, the certificates shall be in such form as required by applicable law and as determined by the Board of Directors. Certificates shall be signed, either manually or in facsimile, by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or a Senior Executive Vice President and by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary. All certificates for shares shall be consecutively numbered or otherwise identified and entered into the stock transfer records of the corporation. When shares are represented by certificates, the corporation shall issue and deliver to each shareholder to whom such shares have been issued or transferred, certificates representing the shares owned by such shareholder. When shares are not represented by certificates, then, within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of such shares, the corporation shall send the shareholder to whom such shares have been issued or transferred a written statement of the information required by applicable law. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the rights and obligations of shareholders are identical whether or not their shares are represented by certificates. The Board of Directors may designate a transfer agent who may countersign each certificate either manually or by use of a facsimile signature.
     
(b) The corporation shall keep, or cause one or more stock transfer agents to keep, the stock transfer records of the corporation, which shall reflect the name and address of each shareholder of record, the number and class or series of shares issued to each shareholder of record and the date of issue of each such share. The Board of Directors may designate a registrar to register each certificate that is issued either manually or by use of a facsimile signature.
     
2.
Transfer of Shares
: Transfers of shares shall be made and recorded on the stock transfer records of the corporation only upon surrender of the certificates for the shares sought to be transferred by the record holder thereof or by his or her duly authorized agent, transferee or
11
legal representative. All certificates surrendered for transfer shall be cancelled before new certificates for the transferred shares shall be issued.
     
3.
Fixing Record Date
: The Board of Directors may fix a future date as the record date for one or more voting groups in order to determine the shareholders entitled to notice of a shareholders' meeting, to demand a special meeting, to vote or to take any other action. Such record date may not be more than 70 days before the meeting or action requiring a determination of shareholders. A determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a shareholders' meeting is effective for any adjournment of the meeting unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting, which it must do if the meeting is adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, the close of business on the day before the date the first notice of the meeting is delivered to shareholders shall be the record date for such determination of shareholders. The Board of Directors may fix a date as the record date for determining shareholders entitled to a distribution or share dividend. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors for such determination, the record date shall be the date the Board of Directors authorizes the distribution or share dividend.

Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates
: The Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of a new share certificate in place of a certificate claimed to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon receipt of a written statement of such fact from the person claiming that the certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed. When authorizing such issuance of a new certificate, the Board may require the claimant or his or her legal representative to give the corporation a bond in such sum and with such surety or other security as the Board may direct to indemnify the corporation against loss from any claim with respect to the certificate claimed to have been lost, stolen or destroyed; or the Board may, by resolution, authorize the issuance of the new certificate without requiring such a bond.
