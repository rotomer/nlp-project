 - 
                 
no covered report omitted a material fact necessary to make the statements in the covered report, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading as of the end of the period covered by such report (or in the case of a report on Form 8-K or definitive proxy materials, as of the date on which it was filed).
 
2.
                                      
I have reviewed the contents of this statement with the Company's audit committee.

all reports on Form 10-Q, all reports on Form 8-K and all definitive proxy materials of Best Buy Co., Inc. filed with the Commission subsequent to the filing of the Form 10-K identified above; and
