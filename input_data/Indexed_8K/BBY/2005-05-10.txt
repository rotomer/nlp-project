Explanatory Note
 
This Current Report on Form 8-K/A amends the registrant's Current Report on Form 8-K filed December 30, 2004, as amended by the registrant's Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed on February 25, 2005, to reflect that Ernst & Young LLP has been dismissed as the registrant's independent auditor.
 
Item 4.01 Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
 
On May 10, 2005, contemporaneously with the conclusion of the audit for its fiscal year ended February 26, 2005, Ernst & Young LLP (E&Y) was dismissed as the independent auditor for Best Buy Co., Inc. The registrant previously announced that the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors and E&Y had determined that E&Y would be dismissed as the registrant's independent auditor, effective at the conclusion of such audit. The registrant also previously announced that it named Deloitte & Touche LLP as its independent auditor for the fiscal year which began February 27, 2005.
 
The reports of E&Y on the consolidated financial statements of the registrant for the fiscal years ended February 26, 2005 and February 28, 2004 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. In connection with the audits for the two most recent fiscal years and through the date of dismissal, there were no disagreements with E&Y on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of E&Y, would have caused E&Y to make reference thereto in their reports on the financial statements for such fiscal years. During the two most recent fiscal years and through the date of dismissal, there have been no "reportable events," as such term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
 
The registrant provided E&Y with a copy of this disclosure and requested that E&Y furnish it with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the above statements. A copy of E&Y's letter, dated May 10, 2005, is filed as Exhibit 16 to this Current Report on Form 8-K/A.
 
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
(c) Exhibits.
 
The following is filed as an Exhibit to this Report.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Gentlemen:
 
 
We have read Item 4.01 of Form 8-K/A dated May 10, 2005, of Best Buy Co., Inc. and are in agreement with all the statements contained in Item 4.01 except for the last sentence of the first paragraph.  We have no basis to agree or disagree with the statements made by the registrant in the last sentence of the first paragraph in Item 4.01.

Mr. Robert Burnett
Staff Accountant
Securities and Exchange Commission
450 Fifth Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C.  20549
 
 
Dear Mr. Burnett:
 
                Transmitted herewith for filing on behalf of Best Buy Co., Inc. (the "Registrant"), is its Current Report on Form 8-K/A, Amendment No. 2 (the "Amendment"), which further amends the Registrant's Current Report on Form 8-K, filed December 30, 2004 ("Form 8-K"), as amended February 25, 2005 ("Form 8-K/A").
 
To facilitate your review of the Amendment, we will respond to each of the comments contained in your letter dated March 29, 2005, and addressed to Bruce Besanko, Vice President - Finance of Best Buy (who left the Registrant effective April 4, 2005).  The paragraph numbers below correspond to the numbered comments in your letter.
 
1 and 2.
  As indicated in the Form 8-K, Ernst & Young LLP ("E&Y") was to be dismissed as the Registrant's independent auditor effective at the conclusion of the audit for the fiscal year ended February 26, 2005. The audit was completed on May 10, 2005, the same day the Registrant filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K which included E&Y's audit report on the Registrant's financial statements and internal controls for the fiscal year ended February 26, 2005. Accordingly, the Registrant is filing the Amendment contemporaneously herewith (which is within four business days after the date of dismissal) to further amend the Form 8-K and Form 8-K/A to disclose the date E&Y ceased being its principal accountant, to reiterate that there were no disagreements with E&Y through December 29, 2004, and to state that there were still no disagreements through May 10, 2005, the last day E&Y acted as the Registrant's principal accountant. We have also included as an exhibit to the Amendment a letter from E&Y confirming that they agree with the disclosure contained in the Amendment.

3.  
After discussing the comment with the Staff on March 29, 2005, the Registrant determined that no revision to Form 8-K/A is necessary as there had been no consultations with Deloitte & Touche LLP prior to their engagement regarding any of the matters or reportable events set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.
 
4.  
The Registrant's letter to the Staff dated January 10, 2005, was filed on March 30, 2005, as an EDGAR correspondence file.
 
We appreciate your responsiveness and attention to these matters. We will contact you on Monday, May 16, 2005, to confirm your receipt of this letter and to determine whether the Staff has any further comments.
 
Yours very truly,
ROBINS, KAPLAN, MILLER & CIRESI L.L.P.
