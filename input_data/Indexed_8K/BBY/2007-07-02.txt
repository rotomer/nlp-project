Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On June 26, 2007, Best Buy Co., Inc. entered into two agreements to purchase shares of its common stock from Goldman Sachs & Co. ("Goldman Sachs") for an aggregate purchase price of $3.0 billion pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") program. Repurchased shares will be retired immediately and will be authorized but unissued shares as required under Minnesota law. The registrant is acquiring these shares as part of a new $5.5 billion share repurchase program approved by the registrant's Board of Directors on June 26, 2007.  The new share repurchase program terminates and replaces a $1.5 billion share repurchase program approved in June 2006.
The number of shares to be repurchased under the ASR program will be based generally on the volume-weighted average price of the registrant's common stock during the term of the agreements. Purchases under one of the ASR agreements are subject to collar provisions that will establish minimum and maximum numbers of shares based on the volume-weighted average share price over an initial hedge period. ASR program purchases totaling $2.0 billion will be effected under the collar agreement. The minimum and maximum numbers of shares that the registrant will repurchase pursuant to the collar agreement will not be known until conclusion of the hedge period, which is expected to occur during the second quarter of fiscal 2008.   The remaining $1.0 billion of the ASR program will not be subject to collar provisions. The registrant expects all ASR program purchases to be completed by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, although the completion date may be accelerated at the option of Goldman Sachs. The actual number of shares repurchased will be determined at the completion of the ASR program.
The agreements, each dated June 26, 2007, contain the principal terms and provisions governing the ASR program including, but not limited to, the mechanism used to determine the amount of shares that will be delivered by Goldman Sachs to the registrant, the required timing of delivery of the shares, the specific circumstances under which Goldman Sachs is permitted to make adjustments to valuation periods, the specific circumstances under which the ASR program may be terminated early and various acknowledgements, representations and warranties made by the registrant and Goldman Sachs to one another, including representations related to Rule 10b5-1 and intended compliance with the Rule 10b-18 volume and timing guidelines. The agreements are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 hereto and are incorporated herein by reference.

Item 2.03  Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On June 26, 2007, the registrant entered into a $3.0 billion bridge loan facility with Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P. (the "Bridge Facility").  The registrant will become obligated under the Bridge Facility upon receipt of funds.  The Bridge Facility has a term of 364 days and will be used along with existing cash and investments to finance the ASR program.  The registrant expects to pay the balance of the bridge loan prior to the end of its term.  The Bridge Facility is filed as Exhibit 10.3 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
Additionally, the registrant has received a commitment letter from J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. ("J.P. Morgan") for a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $2.0 billion.  The final terms of the credit facility remain subject to negotiation by the registrant and J.P. Morgan.  A copy of the commitment letter is filed as Exhibit 10.4 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
Finally, on June 26, 2007, the registrant provided noticed to U.S. Bank, N.A. ("U.S. Bank") of its intent to terminate effective July 2, 2007, the $200 million revolving credit facility that the registrant previously established with U.S. Bank.
In the ordinary course of their business, Goldman Sachs,  J.P. Morgan, U.S. Bank and their respective affiliates have engaged, and in the future may engage, in financial advisory and/or investment banking transactions with the registrant and its affiliates. They have received and will receive customary fees and commissions for these transactions.
Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On June 26, 2007, the Board of Directors of Best Buy Co., Inc. adopted Amended and Restated Bylaws to decrease the number of potential Board members from thirteen to twelve.  The composition of the Board now includes five Class 1 directors for election to two year terms in even numbered years and seven Class 2 directors for election to two year terms in odd numbered years.
The Amended and Restated Bylaws became effective on June 26, 2007, and are attached as Exhibit 3.1 hereto.
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
On June 27, 2007, Best Buy Co., Inc. issued a news release announcing the new share repurchase program and the ASR program, a 30% increase in the registrant's quarterly cash dividend to $0.13 per share of common stock, and that the registrant raised its total potential for stores in North America to 1,800 stores.
The news release issued on June 27, 2007, is furnished as Exhibit No. 99.1 hereto. Best Buy Co., Inc.'s Annual Report to Shareholders and its reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K and other publicly available information should be consulted for other important information about the registrant.

The additional terms of any particular Transaction shall be set forth in (i) a Supplemental Confirmation in the form of Schedule A hereto (a ""), which shall reference this Master Confirmation and supplement, form a part of, and be subject to this Master Confirmation and (ii) a Trade Notification in the form of Schedule B hereto (a ""), which shall reference the relevant Supplemental Confirmation and supplement, form a part of, and be subject to such Supplemental Confirmation.  This Master Confirmation, each Supplemental Confirmation and the related Trade Notification together shall constitute a "Confirmation" as referred to in the Agreement specified below.

Supplemental Confirmation
Trade Notification
The definitions and provisions contained in the 2002 ISDA Equity Derivatives Definitions (the ""), as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc., are incorporated into this Master Confirmation.  This Master Confirmation, each Supplemental Confirmation and the related Trade Notification evidence a complete binding agreement between Counterparty and GS&Co. as to the subject matter and terms of each Transaction to which this Master Confirmation, such Supplemental Confirmation and Trade Notification relate and shall supersede all prior or contemporaneous written or oral communications with respect thereto.
Equity Definitions
This Master Confirmation, each Supplemental Confirmation and each Trade Notification supplement, form a part of, and are subject to an agreement in the form of the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) (the "") as if GS&Co. and Counterparty had executed the Agreement on the date of this Master Confirmation (but without any Schedule except for (i) the election of Loss and Second Method for purposes of Section 6(e) of the Agreement, New York law (without regard to the conflicts of law principles) as the governing law and US Dollars ("USD") as the Termination Currency, (ii) the election that subparagraph (ii) of Section 2(c) will not apply to the Transactions, (iii) the election that the "Cross Default" provisions of Section 5(a)(vi) shall apply to Counterparty, with a "Threshold Amount" of USD100 million).
Agreement
The Transactions shall be the sole Transactions under the Agreement.  If there exists any ISDA Master Agreement between GS&Co. and Counterparty or any confirmation or other agreement between GS&Co. and Counterparty pursuant to which an ISDA Master Agreement is deemed to exist between GS&Co. and Counterparty, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in such ISDA Master Agreement, such confirmation or agreement or any other agreement to which GS&Co. and Counterparty are parties, the Transactions shall not be considered Transactions under, or otherwise governed by, such existing or deemed ISDA Master Agreement.
All provisions contained or incorporated by reference in the Agreement shall govern this Master Confirmation, each Supplemental Confirmation and each Trade Notification except as expressly modified herein or in the related Supplemental Confirmation.
If, in relation to any Transaction to which this Master Confirmation, a Supplemental Confirmation and a Trade Notification relate, there is any inconsistency between the Agreement, this Master Confirmation, any Supplemental Confirmation, any Trade Notification and the Equity Definitions, the following will prevail for purposes of such Transaction in the order of precedence indicated: (i) such Trade Notification, (ii) such Supplemental Confirmation; (iii) this Master Confirmation; (iv) the Agreement; and (v) the Equity Definitions.

In addition, on the Interim Share Delivery Date, GS&Co. shall deliver a number of Shares equal to the excess, if any, of the Interim Shares over the Initial Shares pursuant to Interim Share Delivery below. The additional terms of each Transaction set forth below are intended to be an adjustment to the Prepayment Amount. Solely for purposes of the Equity Definitions, each Transaction shall be treated as if it were a Share Forward Transaction.  However, the parties acknowledge that the Transaction is a Share buyback transaction and is not intended to effect a net issuance of Shares or raise equity capital for Counterparty.  Set forth herein are the terms and conditions which, together with the terms and conditions set forth in each Supplemental Confirmation and Trade Notification relating to any Transaction, shall govern such Transaction.

Arbitration
(a)

(b)
Arbitration awards are generally final and binding; a party's ability to have a court reverse or modify an arbitration award is very limited.
                                 
(c)
Counterparty agrees that any and all controversies that may arise between Counterparty and GS&Co., including, but not limited to, those arising out of or relating to the Agreement or any Transaction hereunder, shall be determined by arbitration conducted before The New York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE") or NASD Dispute Resolution ("NASD-DR"), or, if the NYSE and NASD-DR decline to hear the matter, before the American Arbitration Association, in accordance with their arbitration rules then in force.  The award of the arbitrator shall be final, and judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court, state or federal, having jurisdiction.
                                 
(d)
The ability of the parties to obtain documents, witness statements and other discovery is generally more limited in arbitration than in court proceedings.
                              
(e)
The arbitrators do not have to explain the reason(s) for their award.
                                 
(f)
The panel of arbitrators will typically include a minority of arbitrators who were or are affiliated with the securities industry, unless Counterparty is a member of the organization sponsoring the arbitration facility, in which case all arbitrators may be affiliated with the securities industry.
                                   
(g)
The rules of some arbitration forums may impose time limits for bringing a claim in arbitration.  In some cases, a claim that is ineligible for arbitration may be brought in court.
                                
(h)
The rules of the arbitration forum in which the claim is filed, and any amendments thereto, shall be incorporated into this Confirmation.
                                
(i)
No person shall bring a putative or certified class action to arbitration, nor seek to enforce any pre-dispute arbitration agreement against any person who has initiated in court a putative class action or who is a member of a putative class who has not opted out of the class with respect to any claims encompassed by the putative class action until: (i) the class certification is denied; (ii) the class is decertified; or (iii) Counterparty is excluded from the class by the court.
                                
15
(j)
Such forbearance to enforce an agreement to arbitrate shall not constitute a waiver of any rights under this Confirmation except to the extent stated herein."

Equity Definitions
This Master Confirmation and each Supplemental Confirmation supplement, form a part of, and are subject to an agreement in the form of the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) (the "") as if GS&Co. and Counterparty had executed the Agreement on the date of this Master Confirmation (but without any Schedule except for (i) the election of Loss and Second Method for purposes of Section 6(e) of the Agreement, New York law (without regard to the conflicts of law principles) as the governing law and US Dollars ("USD") as the Termination Currency, (ii) the election that subparagraph (ii) of Section 2(c) will not apply to the Transactions, (iii) the election that the "Cross Default" provisions of Section 5(a)(vi) shall apply to Counterparty, with a "Threshold Amount" of USD100 million).
Agreement
The Transactions shall be the sole Transactions under the Agreement.  If there exists any ISDA Master Agreement between GS&Co. and Counterparty or any confirmation or other agreement between GS&Co. and Counterparty pursuant to which an ISDA Master Agreement is deemed to exist between GS&Co. and Counterparty, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in such ISDA Master Agreement, such confirmation or agreement or any other agreement to which GS&Co. and Counterparty are parties, the Transactions shall not be considered Transactions under, or otherwise governed by, such existing or deemed ISDA Master Agreement.
All provisions contained or incorporated by reference in the Agreement shall govern this Master Confirmation and each Supplemental Confirmation except as expressly modified herein or in the related Supplemental Confirmation.
If, in relation to any Transaction to which this Master Confirmation and a Supplemental Confirmation relate, there is any inconsistency between the Agreement, this Master Confirmation, any Supplemental Confirmation and the Equity Definitions, the following will prevail for purposes of such Transaction in the order of precedence indicated: (i) such Supplemental Confirmation; (ii) this Master Confirmation; (iii) the Agreement; and (iv) the Equity Definitions.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Master Confirmation and the relevant Supplemental Confirmation, on the Initial Share Delivery Date (as defined below), GS&Co. shall deliver to Counterparty a number of Shares equal to the Initial Shares for the relevant Transaction pursuant to Initial Share Delivery below, and Counterparty shall pay to GS&Co. cash in immediately available funds in an amount equal to the Prepayment Amount (as defined below). The additional terms of each Transaction set forth below are intended to be an adjustment to the Prepayment Amount. Solely for purposes of the Equity Definitions, each Transaction shall be treated as if it were a Share Forward Transaction.  However, the parties acknowledge that the Transaction is a Share buyback transaction and is not intended to effect a net issuance of Shares or raise equity capital for Counterparty.  Set forth herein are the terms and conditions which, together with the terms and conditions set forth in each Supplemental Confirmation relating to any Transaction, shall govern such Transaction.

Exhibit 99.1
For Immediate Release
MINNEAPOLIS, June 27, 2007  The Board of Directors of Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY) has approved several shareholder value initiatives. Specifically, the company approved a new $5.5 billion share repurchase program, which terminates and replaces the current share repurchase program, and increased its dividend by 30 percent. In addition, the company raised its new store potential in the United States for Best Buy superstores by 40 percent.
"We have a tremendous amount of optimism in our long-term growth prospects and the capabilities of our employees," said Brad Anderson, vice chairman and CEO of Best Buy. "Our 41 years of proven success, our strong balance sheet and our belief in our employees afford us the opportunity to fund multiple avenues of value creation at once. We are confident in our business strategy, based on our expanding market share and rising customer satisfaction levels. It is very rewarding to see so much opportunity for customer growth in front of us, particularly in our core U.S. market."
Best Buy Board of Directors Authorizes $5.5 Billion Stock Repurchase Program
Based upon the company's anticipated future earnings and cash flow, its strong balance sheet, and the planned capital needed for the company's growth plans, the Board of Directors of Best Buy has authorized the establishment of a new, $5.5 billion share repurchase program. The new program terminates and replaces the company's prior $1.5 billion share repurchase program, which was announced on June 21, 2006.
Best Buy has used a portion of this new share repurchase program immediately to execute an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program, with Goldman Sachs as the counterparty, for the repurchase of $3.0 billion of common stock no later than February 2008. The exact number of repurchased shares will be determined at the conclusion of the agreements. The majority of the impact of the ASR will be included in the company's share count by the end of July. Combined with the $462 million of share repurchases to date, the company will have purchased nearly $3.5 billion of stock in fiscal 2008. Both Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan advised Best Buy in respect to the ASR program.
The company expects to fund this $3.0 billion ASR program through cash, short-term investments and interim borrowing. The company also expects to retire its existing $200 million credit facility and to replace it with a committed, $2.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility to be used for general corporate purposes.
The remaining $2.5 billion available under the new share repurchase program is expected to be utilized subject to business results, market conditions and Board approval.
"We view capital allocation as a portfolio of investments driving both near-term and long-term shareholder value. We believe our company is one of the best investments available today because we are confident in our employees' abilities to deliver terrific customer experiences," said Darren Jackson, executive vice president and CFO. The company's market capitalization as of June 26, 2007, was approximately $21.3 billion.
The new share repurchase program is expected to produce a myriad of long-term benefits to drive shareholder value. The program preserves the company's ability to grow while decreasing the cost of capital and increasing return on invested capital. The company expects this new repurchase program to have a modest benefit on the fiscal 2008 diluted earnings per share. Specifically, the lower share count will be offset by a reduction in net interest income related to lower cash and investment balances and interest on interim borrowing. In addition, the company expects an increase in the company's effective tax rate to approximately 37 percent for the fiscal year as a result of the planned sale of tax-advantaged short-term investments.
Best Buy had 473.9 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of June 2, 2007. The company reported cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $2.8 billion as of the same date.
Company Increases Dividend 30 Percent
The Board of Directors also announced its intention to increase the company's quarterly cash dividend to 13 cents per common share, a 30-percent increase compared with the existing dividend of 10 cents
per common share. The change will be effective with the quarterly dividend which, if authorized, would be payable on Oct. 30, 2007, to shareholders of record as of Oct. 9, 2007.
Best Buy paid its first cash dividend in December 2003 and has increased the dividend annually since then.
U.S. Best Buy Store Outlook Increases 40 Percent
The company also said the number of stores could now approach 1,800 in the United States and Canada, up from its prior growth plan of 1,400 stores. This new total assumes 1,400 U.S. Best Buy superstores, up from 1,000 previously; at least 200 Canadian superstores (including both Future Shop and Best Buy stores); and up to 200 Pacific Sales stores. Furthermore, the company remains committed to expansion in China via both the Five Star and Best Buy brands. The company currently operates 852 U.S. Best Buy stores, 47 Canada Best Buy stores, 122 Canada Future Shop stores and 14 U.S. Pacific Sales stores. On average, the company has historically increased North American square footage by approximately 10 percent per year.
"We continue to generate strong returns on new store openings, and we're growing our market share with our customer-focused strategy," said Brian Dunn, president and chief operating officer. "We intend to press this advantage in the marketplace.  We firmly believe we can extend our new store runway, profitably, because we'll continue to focus on three things: improving how well we serve existing customers, attracting new customers and enhancing our store profit model."
