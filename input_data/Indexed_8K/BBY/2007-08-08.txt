Safe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, provide a "safe harbor" for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their companies. With the exception of historical information, the matters discussed in this Current Report on Form 8-K are forward-looking statements and may be identified by the use of words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend" "plan," "project," "outlook," and other words and terms of similar meaning. Such statements reflect the registrant's current view with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. A variety of factors could cause the registrant's future results to differ materially from the anticipated results expressed in such forward-looking statements. Readers should review Item 1A, , of the registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 3, 2007, for a description of important factors that could cause future results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements made in this Current Report on Form 8-K. In addition, general economic conditions, acquisitions and development of new businesses, divestitures, product availability, sales volumes, pricing actions and promotional activities of the registrant's competitors, profit margins, weather, changes in law or regulations, foreign currency fluctuation, availability of suitable real estate locations, the registrant's ability to react to a disaster recovery situation, and the impact of labor markets and new product introductions on the registrant's overall profitability, among other things, could cause the registrant's future results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statement.
