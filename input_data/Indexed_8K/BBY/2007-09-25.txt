Item 2.03  Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
 
On September 19, 2007, Best Buy Co., Inc. entered into a $2.5 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (the "Agreement") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("JPMorgan"), as administrative agent, and a syndication of banks (collectively, the "Lenders"). Some of the Lenders and/or their affiliates have other business relationships with the registrant involving the provision of financial and banking-related services, including cash management, loans, foreign exchange contracts, letters of credit and bank guarantee facilities, investment banking and trust services. The Agreement permits borrowings up to $2.5 billion (which may be increased up to $3.0 billion at the registrant's option and upon the consent of JPMorgan and one or more Lenders providing the incremental credit commitment), with a $300 million letter of credit sub-limit and a $200 million foreign currency sub-limit. The Agreement terminates in September 2012.
 
Interest rates under the Agreement are variable and are determined at the registrant's option at: (i) the greater of JPMorgan's prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (ii) the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus applicable LIBOR margin. A facility fee is assessed on the commitment amount. Both the LIBOR margin and the facility fee are based upon the registrant's current senior unsecured debt rating. The LIBOR margin ranges from 0.32% to 0.60%, and the facility fee ranges from 0.08% to 0.15%.
 
The Agreement is guaranteed by specified subsidiaries of the registrant and contains customary affirmative and negative covenants. Among other things, these covenants restrict or prohibit the registrant's ability to incur certain types or amounts of indebtedness, incur liens on certain assets, make material changes in the registrant's corporate structure or the nature of its business, dispose of material assets, allow non-material subsidiaries to make guarantees, engage in a change in control transaction, or engage in certain transactions with the registrant's affiliates. The Agreement also contains covenants that require the registrant to maintain a maximum quarterly cash flow leverage ratio and a minimum quarterly interest coverage ratio.  The Agreement contains customary default provisions including, but not limited to, failure to pay interest or principal when due and failure to comply with covenants.
 
Simultaneously with the execution of the Agreement, the registrant borrowed $1.35 billion under the Agreement and used $1.15 billion of the proceeds to repay the outstanding balance on the $2.5 billion bridge loan facility with Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P. that was entered into in July 2007 (the "Bridge Facility"). Accordingly, the Bridge Facility was terminated effective September 19, 2007. The remaining $200 million borrowed under the Agreement will be used for general corporate purposes. At the date of filing of this Current Report on Form 8-K, $1.35 billion was outstanding under the Agreement.

The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, and neither the Borrower nor any other Obligor shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions.
Administrative Agent
 
The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:
 
shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;
(a)
                                 
 
shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law; and
(b)
                                
provided

(c)
                                 
 
The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the
Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02 and Article VIII) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower, a Lender or an Issuing Lender.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article V or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
 
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or such Issuing Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or such Issuing Lender prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for an Obligor), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
 
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and each Issuing Lender directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this paragraph. Upon the acceptance of a successor's appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.

Unless otherwise stated herein, my opinions herein are based upon my consideration of only those statutes, rules and regulations which, in my experience, are normally applicable to borrowers and guarantors in unsecured loan transactions.

I express no opinion with respect to those matters herein, and to the extent elements of those opinions are necessary to the conclusions expressed herein, I have, with your consent, assumed such matters.
 
Subject to the foregoing and the other matters set forth herein, it is my opinion that, as of the date hereof:
 
Each of the Borrower and BBC Property Co. is a corporation under the MBCA with corporate power and authority to enter into the Credit Agreement (and in the case of Borrower, the Notes), to incur liability thereunder in respect of borrowings under the Credit Agreement (and in the case of the Borrower, the Notes) and to perform its obligations thereunder.

Best Buy Stores, L.P., is a limited partnership under the VULPA with limited partnership power and authority to enter into the Credit Agreement and to perform its obligations thereunder. Based on certificates from public officials, I confirm that Best Buy Stores, L.P. is validly existing and in good standing under the VULPA.

The execution, delivery and performance of the Credit Agreement (and in the case of the Borrower, the Notes) by the Borrower and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors has been duly authorized by all necessary organizational (corporate or limited partnership) action of the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantors and the Credit Agreement (and in the case of the Borrower, the Notes) has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and each Subsidiary Guarantor.
4.
                                      
The execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement (and in the case of the Borrower, the Notes) by the Borrower and each Subsidiary Guarantor party thereto on the date hereof does not:
5.
                                      
 
violate the provisions of its Governing Documents;

(iii)
                              
 
violate or result in a default under any material indenture, agreement or other instrument binding upon the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.
(iv)
                             
 
Except as disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Borrower for the fiscal year ended March 3, 2007 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, there are no material actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority now pending against or, to my knowledge, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that would purport to affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any Loan Document, the borrowing or repayment of any Loans, or the issuance of any Letter of Credit or payment of any reimbursement obligation in respect thereof.
6.
                                      
 
I express no opinion as to the enforceability of any document or as to compliance with any laws other than, as to the Borrower or the Subsidiary Guarantors, its Constitutive Law.
 
This letter is furnished only to you and is solely for your benefit in connection with the transactions referenced in the first paragraph. This letter may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or furnished or quoted by you to any other person, firm or entity for any other purpose and may not be assigned to or relied on by any other person, firm or entity for any purpose, in each case without my prior written consent, which may be granted or withheld in my discretion.

Terms defined in the Credit Agreement have the same respective defined meanings when used herein.
"Credit Agreement")
"Borrower"),
("BBCP"
"Subsidiary Guarantors,
"Obligors"),
"Lenders")
 
In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have examined executed counterparts of the Credit Agreement. In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity with authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. When relevant facts were not independently established, we have relied upon representations made in or pursuant to the Credit Agreement or in certificates delivered by or on behalf of the Obligors pursuant thereto. We have also assumed that the Credit Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and (except, to the extent set forth below, as to the Obligors) constitutes legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of, all of the parties thereto, that all signatories thereto have been duly authorized and that all such parties are duly organized and validly existing and have the power and authority (corporate, partnership or other) to execute, deliver and perform the same.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing and subject also to the comments and qualifications set forth below, and having considered such questions of law as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below, we are of the opinion that the Credit Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each Obligor, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally, and except as the enforceability of each of the Credit Agreement is subject to the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including without limitation (i) the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (ii) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.
 
The foregoing opinions are also subject to the following comments and qualifications:
 
The enforceability of provisions in the Credit Agreement to the effect that terms may not be waived or modified except in writing may be limited under certain circumstances.
(A)
                             
 
The enforceability of Section 10.03(b) of the Credit Agreement may be limited by laws limiting the enforceability of provisions exculpating or exempting a party from, or requiring indemnification of a party for, liability for its own action or inaction, to the extent the action or inaction involves gross negligence, recklessness, wilful misconduct or unlawful conduct.
(B)
                               
 
We express no opinion as to (i) the effect of the laws of any jurisdiction in which any Lender is located (other than New York) that limits the interest, fees or other charges it may impose for the loan or use of money or other credit, (ii) Section 3.06 of the Credit Agreement, (iii) Section 3.09 of the Credit Agreement, (iv) the next to last sentence of Section 10.04(c)(i) of the Credit Agreement, (v) Section 10.08 of the Credit Agreement, (vi) the first sentence of Section 10.09(b) of the Credit Agreement insofar as such sentence relates to the subject-matter jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to adjudicate any controversy related to the Credit Agreement, (vii) the waiver of inconvenient forum set forth in Section 10.09(c) of the Credit Agreement with respect to proceedings in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or (viii) Section 10.12 of the Credit Agreement.
(C)
                               
 
Section 3.02 of the Credit Agreement may not be enforceable to the extent that the Guaranteed Obligations as defined therein are materially modified.
(D)
                              
 
We express no opinion as to the applicability to the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under Article 3 of the Credit Agreement (or the
(E)
                                
enforceability of such obligations under) Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code, Article 10 of the New York Debtor and Creditor Law or any other provision of law relating to fraudulent conveyances, transfers or obligations, or the provisions of the law of the jurisdiction of incorporation of any Subsidiary Guarantor restricting dividends, loans or other distributions by a corporation for the benefit of its stockholders.
 
(F) We wish to point out with reference to obligations stated to be payable in a currency other than Dollars that (i) a New York statute provides that a judgment rendered by a court of the State of New York in respect of an obligation denominated in such other currency would be rendered in such other currency and would be converted into Dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of entry of the judgment and (ii) a judgment rendered by a Federal court sitting in the State of New York in respect of an obligation denominated in such other currency may be expressed in Dollars, but we express no opinion as to the rate of exchange such Federal court would apply.
 
The foregoing opinions are limited to matters involving the Federal laws of the United States and the law of the State of New York, and we do not express any opinion as to the law of any other jurisdiction.
 
This opinion letter is provided to you by us as special New York counsel to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. pursuant to Section 5.01(c) of the Credit Agreement and may not be relied upon by any other person or for any purpose other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement without our prior written consent in each instance.
