ITEM 2.03
CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT.
 
Best Buy Co., Inc. ("Best Buy" or the "registrant") today announced the closing of an offering of $500 million of its 6.75% notes due 2013 (the "Notes") to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and to persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 6.75% per year, payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2009 through July 15, 2013 (the maturity date).  The interest rate payable on the Notes will be subject to adjustment if either Moody's Investor Services or Standard & Poor's Ratings Services downgrades to below investment grade the rating assigned to the Notes.
 
The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the registrant and will rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated debt of the registrant. The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture (the "Indenture"), as supplemented by a first supplemental indenture (the "Supplemental Indenture"), which contains covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the registrant and its North American subsidiaries to incur debt secured by liens, to enter into sale and lease-back transactions and, in the case of such subsidiaries, to incur debt as described in the Indenture, a copy of which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 4.1, and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The registrant may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and an applicable make-whole amount as described in the Supplemental Indenture, a copy of which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 4.2, and is incorporated herein by reference.  If a change of control triggering event, as described in the Supplemental Indenture, occurs, the registrant will be required to offer to repurchase the Notes, unless it has exercised its option to redeem the Notes.
 
In connection with the issuance of the Notes, the registrant entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") pursuant to which the registrant agreed, among other things, to use its reasonable best efforts to (i) consummate an exchange offer for the Notes by January 31, 2009, pursuant to which the Notes would be exchanged for substantially identical notes registered under the Securities Act, or (ii) cause a shelf registration statement covering the resale of the Notes to be declared effective. A copy of the Registration Rights Agreement is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 4.3, and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The registrant intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to fund a portion of its purchase of a 50% interest in The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC's mobile services and retail distribution business as previously announced and referred to in its Current Reports on Forms 8-K and 8-K/A filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on May 8, 2008, May 13, 2008 and June 12, 2008.
 
The above descriptions of the Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement do not purport to be complete statements of the parties' rights and obligations under these instruments. The above descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement.

All Securities of any series need not be issued at the same time and, unless otherwise provided, a series may be reopened, without the consent of the Holders, for issuances of additional Securities of such series.

In case any officer of the Company who shall have signed any Security shall cease to be such officer before the Security so signed shall be authenticated and delivered by the Trustee or disposed of by the Company, such Security nevertheless may be authenticated and delivered or disposed of as though the person who signed such Security had not ceased to be such officer of the Company, as the case may be; and any Security may be signed on behalf of the Company by such persons as, at the actual date of the execution of such Security shall be the proper officers of the Company, as the case may be, although at the date of the execution and delivery of this Indenture any such person was not such officer.

Upon due presentation for registration of transfer of any Security of any series at each such office or agency, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery in the name of the designated transferee or transferees a new Security or Securities of the same series, in each case, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate Principal Amount.
 
At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series (except a Global Security) may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate Principal Amount and Stated Maturity, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency.  Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
 
A Holder may transfer a Security only by written application to the Registrar stating the name of the proposed transferee and otherwise complying with the terms of this Indenture.  No such transfer shall be effected until, and such transferee shall succeed to the rights of a Holder only upon, final acceptance and registration of the transfer by the Registrar in the Security Register.  Prior to the registration of any transfer by a Holder as provided herein, the Company, the Trustee, and any agent of the Company shall treat the Person in whose name the Security is registered as the owner thereof for all purposes whether or not the Security shall be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee, nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.  Furthermore, any Holder of a Global Security shall, by acceptance of such Global Security, agree that transfers of beneficial interests in such Global Security may be effected only through a book entry system maintained by the Holder of such Global Security (or its agent) and that ownership of a beneficial interest in the Security shall be required to be reflected in a book entry.  When Securities are presented to the Registrar or a co-Registrar with a request to register the transfer or to exchange them for an equal Principal Amount of Securities of other authorized denominations, the Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested if the requirements for such transactions set forth herein are met.  To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate Securities at the Registrar's request.
The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any exchange or registration of transfer of Securities (other than any such transfer taxes or other similar governmental charge payable upon exchanges pursuant to Section 3.11, 8.05 or 10.03).  No service charge to any Holder shall be made for any such transaction.
 
The Company shall not be required to exchange or register a transfer of (a) any Securities of any series for a period of 15 days next preceding the first mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of that series to be redeemed or (b) any Securities of any series selected, called or being called for redemption except, in the case of any Security of any series where public notice has been given that such Security is to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not so to be redeemed.
 
All Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange of Securities shall be valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.
 
Section 3.08(a) Each Global Security initially shall (i) be registered in the name of the Depositary for such Global Securities or the nominee of such Depositary, (ii) be delivered to the Trustee as custodian for such Depositary or such nominee and (iii) bear legends as set forth in Section 3.06.

Members of, or participants in, the Depositary ("") shall have no rights under this Indenture with respect to any Global Security held on their behalf by the Depositary, or the Trustee as its custodian, or under the Global Security, and the Depositary may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee, from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or impair, as between the Depositary and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of any Security.

Transfers of a Global Security shall be limited to transfers of such Global Security in whole, but not in part, to the Depositary for such series, its successors or their respective nominees.  If at any time the Depositary for the Securities of such series notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary or if at any time the Depositary shall no longer be qualified to serve as the Depositary, the Company shall appoint a successor depositary with respect to the Securities of such series.  If a successor depositary for the Securities of such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery
of definitive Securities of such series of like tenor, will authenticate and deliver Certificated Securities of such series of like tenor and terms in an aggregate Principal Amount equal to the Principal Amount of the Global Security or Securities of such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
 
The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Securities of a series issued in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by such Global Securities.  In such event, the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of Certificated Securities of such series of like tenor and terms, will authenticate and deliver Securities of such series of like tenor and terms in definitive form in an aggregate Principal Amount equal to the Principal Amount of the Global Security or Securities of such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.  Interests of beneficial owners in a Global Security may be transferred in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Depositary.  In addition, Certificated Securities shall be transferred to all beneficial owners in exchange for their beneficial interests in a Global Security, if (i) the Depositary (A) notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security, and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of such notice, or (B) ceases to be qualified to serve as Depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of such notice, (ii) the Company executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order that such Global Security shall be so transferable, registrable and exchangeable, and such transfers shall be registrable, or (iii) an Event of Default of which the Trustee has actual notice has occurred and is continuing and the Registrar has received a request from the Depositary to issue such Certificated Securities.
 
(c)
                                 
Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Securities that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the another Global Security will, upon such transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Security and become an interest in the other Global Security and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Security for as long as it remains such an interest.
 
(d)
                                
In connection with any transfer of a portion of the beneficial interests in a Global Security to beneficial owners pursuant to Section 3.08(b), the Registrar shall reflect on its books and records the date and a decrease in the Principal Amount of such Global Security in an amount equal to the Principal Amount of the beneficial interest in such Global Security to be transferred, and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, one or more Certificated Securities of like tenor and amount.
 
(e)
                                 
In connection with the transfer of an entire Global Security to beneficial owners pursuant to Section 3.08(b), such Global Security shall be deemed to be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation, and the Company shall
execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, to each beneficial owner identified by the Depositary in exchange for its beneficial interest in such Global Security, an equal Principal Amount of Certificated Securities of authorized denominations.
 
(f)
                                   
The registered holder of a Global Security may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person, including Agent Members and Persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action which a Holder is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Securities of such series.
 
Section 3.09In case any temporary or definitive Security shall become mutilated, defaced or be apparently destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company in its discretion may execute, and upon the delivery to the Trustee of a Company Order and of all documents and certificates as required by this Indenture, the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, a new Security of the same series bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated or defaced Security, or in lieu of and substitution for the Security so apparently destroyed, lost or stolen.  In every case the applicant for a substitute Security shall furnish to the Company and the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by each of them to indemnify and defend and to save each of them harmless and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence to their satisfaction of the apparent destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof.
.  Mutilated, Defaced, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities. 
 
Upon the issuance of any substitute Security, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.  In case any Security which has matured or is about to mature, or has been called for redemption in full, shall become mutilated or defaced or be apparently destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, instead of issuing a substitute Security of the same series, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated or defaced Security), if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee such security or indemnity as any of them may require to save each of them harmless from all risks, however remote, and, in every case of apparent destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Company and the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the apparent destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof.
 
Every substitute Security issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3.09 by virtue of the fact that any Security is apparently destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company whether or not the apparently destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone and shall be entitled to all the benefits of (but shall be
subject to all the limitations of rights set forth in) this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.  All Securities shall be held and owned upon the express condition that, to the extent permitted by law, with respect to the holder of a substitute Security, the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, defaced, or apparently destroyed, lost or stolen Securities and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
 
Section 3.10All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange, if surrendered to the Company or any agent of the Company or the Trustee, shall be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be cancelled by it; and no Securities shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture.  The Trustee shall dispose of cancelled Securities in accordance with its customary procedures.  If the Company shall acquire any of the Securities, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
.  Cancellation of Securities. 
 
Section 3.11Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery temporary Securities of such series (printed, typewritten or otherwise reproduced, in each case in form satisfactory to the Trustee).  Temporary Securities shall be issuable as registered Securities of such series without coupons, of any authorized denomination, and substantially in the form of the definitive Securities of such series but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Securities, all as may be determined by the Company with the concurrence of the Trustee.  Temporary Securities may contain such reference to any provisions of this Indenture as may be appropriate.  Every temporary Security shall be executed by the Company and be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with like effect, as the definitive Securities of such series.  Without unreasonable delay the Company shall execute and shall furnish definitive Securities of such series and thereupon temporary Securities of such series may be surrendered in exchange therefor without charge at each office or agency to be maintained by the Company for the purpose pursuant to Section 4.05, and upon delivery to the Trustee of all documents and certificates as required by this Indenture, the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery in exchange for such temporary Securities a like aggregate Principal Amount of definitive Securities of such series of authorized denominations.  Until so exchanged the temporary Securities of such series shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series.

in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use the CUSIP numbers or ISIN numbers, as the case may be, in notices of redemption or exchange as a convenience to Holders of such series; that any such notice shall state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption or exchange and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers.  The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP numbers or ISIN numbers.

the Trustee has failed to institute such proceeding, and has not received from the Holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the outstanding Securities of such series a direction inconsistent with such request, within 90 days after such notice, request and offer.
 
The limitations in this Section 5.06 shall not apply to a suit instituted by a Holder of Securities for the enforcement of payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on such Securities on or after the applicable due date specified in such Securities (after giving effect to any applicable grace period specified in the related supplemental indenture).

Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities of any series or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
 
Section 5.10If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article 5, it shall pay out the money in the following order:

In case an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of a series has occurred (and is continuing which has not been cured or waived) the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture with respect to such series, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs.

(b)
                                
in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any statements, certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such statements, certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the form requirements of this Indenture;

(d)
                                
the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders given as provided in Section 5.05 or otherwise exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee under this Indenture.

(a)
          
 
.
(b)
          
Interest Rate
 
The rate at which the Notes shall bear interest shall be 6.75% per annum, subject to Section 2.01(b)(ii); the date from which interest shall accrue on the Notes shall be June 24, 2008, or the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or provided for; the Interest Payment Dates for the Notes shall be January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2009; the interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date, shall be paid, in immediately available funds, to the Persons in whose names the Notes (or one or more predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the January 1 or July 1, as the case may be, next preceding such
(i)
           
Interest Payment Date, without regard to any transfer or exchange of such Notes subsequent to the Regular Record Date and prior to such Interest Payment Date.  Any such interest not punctually paid or duly provided for shall, at the Company's option, cease to be payable to the respective Holders on such Regular Record Date, and such defaulted interest may be paid to the Persons in whose names the Notes (or one or more predecessor Notes) are registered at the close of business on a special record date, which date may not be less than 10 days prior to the date of payment of such defaulted interest, for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Notes not less than 15 days prior to such special record date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Base Indenture. Payment of principal and interest on the Notes shall be made at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee or such other office or agency of the Company as may be designated for such purpose, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; , , that each installment of interest and principal on the Notes may at the Company's option with written notice to the Trustee be paid in immediately available funds by transfer to an account maintained by the payee located in the United States, such payee has given written wire transfer instructions to the Company.

provided
 
The interest rate payable on the Notes shall be subject to adjustments from time to time if either Moody's or S&P, or in either case, a Substitute Rating Agency thereof, downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the rating assigned to the Notes, in the manner described below.
(ii)
          
 
If the rating of the Notes from Moody's or any Substitute Rating Agency thereof is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Notes shall increase from the interest rate payable on the Notes on the Issue Date by the percentage points set forth below opposite that rating:
(A)
         
 
 
* Including the equivalent ratings of any Substitute Rating Agency.
If the rating of the Notes from S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency thereof is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Notes shall increase from the interest rate payable on the Notes on the Issue Date by the percentage points set forth below opposite that rating:
(B)
          
 
 
* Including the equivalent ratings of any Substitute Rating Agency.
 
If at any time the interest rate on the Notes has been adjusted upward and either Moody's or S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute Rating Agency thereof), as the case may be, subsequently increases its rating of the Notes to any of the ratings set forth in the tables above, the interest rate on the Notes shall be decreased such that the interest rate for the Notes equals the interest rate payable on the Notes on the Issue Date plus the applicable percentage points set forth opposite the ratings in the tables above in effect immediately following the increase. If Moody's or any Substitute Rating Agency thereof subsequently increases its rating of the Notes to Baa3 (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher and S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency thereof increases its rating to BBB- (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher, the interest rate on the Notes shall be decreased to the interest rate payable on the Notes on the Issue Date.
(C)
          
 
Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's or S&P (or, in either case, any Substitute Rating Agency thereof), shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the interest rate on the Notes be reduced to below the interest rate payable on the Notes on the Issue Date or (2) the total increase in the interest rate on the Notes exceed 2.00 percentage points above the interest rate payable on the Notes on the Issue Date.
(D)
         
 
No adjustments in the interest rate of the Notes shall be made solely as a result of a Rating Agency ceasing to
(E)
          
provide a rating of the Notes. If at any time less than two Rating Agencies provide a rating of the Notes for reason beyond the Company's control, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a rating of the Notes from a Substitute Rating Agency, to the extent one exists, and if a Substitute Rating Agency exists, for purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the interest rate on the Notes pursuant to the table above (x) such Substitute Rating Agency shall be substituted for the last Rating Agency to provide a rating of the Notes but which has since ceased to provide such rating, (y) the relative ratings scale used by such Substitute Rating Agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt shall be determined in good faith by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company and, for purposes of determining the applicable ratings included in the applicable table in Section 2.01(b)(ii)(A) or 2.01(b)(ii)(B) with respect to such Substitute Rating Agency, such ratings shall be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Moody's or S&P, as applicable, in such table and (z) the interest rate on the Notes shall increase or decrease, as the case may be, such that the interest rate equals the interest rate payable on the Notes on the Issue Date plus the appropriate percentage points, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such Substitute Rating Agency in the applicable table in Section 2.01(b)(ii)(A) or 2.01(b)(ii)(B) (taking into account the provisions of clause (y) above) (plus any applicable percentage points resulting from a decreased rating by the other Rating Agency).
 
For so long as only one Rating Agency provides a rating of the Notes, any subsequent increase or decrease in the interest rate of the Notes necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by such Rating Agency shall be twice the percentage points set forth in the applicable table above. For so long as no Rating Agency provides a rating of the Notes, the interest rate on the Notes shall increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00 percentage points above the interest rate payable on the Notes on the Issue Date.
(F)
          
 
The interest rate on the Notes shall permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described in this Section 2.01(b)(ii) (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by either or both Rating Agencies) if the Notes become rated A2 and A (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher by Moody's and S&P, respectively (or, in either case, any Substitute Rating Agency thereof), or one of these ratings if the Notes are only rated by one Rating Agency.
(G)
          
Any interest rate increase or decrease described in this Section 2.01(b)(ii) shall take effect from the first day of the interest period during which a rating change requires an adjustment in the interest rate. If Moody's or S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency thereof changes its rating of the Notes more than once during any particular interest period, the last change by such agency during such period shall control for purposes of any interest rate increase or decrease with respect to the Notes described above relating to such Rating Agency's action.
(H)
         
 
If the interest rate payable on the Notes is increased as described in this Section 2.01(b)(ii), then the term "interest," as used in this First Supplemental Indenture, the Base Indenture and the Notes, shall be deemed to include any such additional interest unless the context otherwise requires.
(I)
           
 
The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, and Paying Agent, if the Trustee shall not then be acting as Paying Agent, within five calendar days after either Moody's or S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency thereof downgrades, or subsequently upgrades, the rating assigned to the Notes as described by this Section 2.01(b)(ii), an Officer's Certificate stating (i) that the rating downgrade, or subsequent upgrade, as the case may be, has occurred and (ii) the current rating or ratings upon which the interest rate payable on the Notes shall be based.
(J)
           
 
The Notes are not subject to any sinking fund.
(c)
          
 
Interest (including Additional Interest) on the Notes shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months and, in the case of an incomplete month, the number of days elapsed.
(d)
          
 
The Notes shall be issuable in registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
(e)
          
 
The principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Notes shall be payable at the office or agency of the Company designated for that purpose as the Payment Office, as provided in Section 4.05 of the Base Indenture; , that interest may be payable at the option of the Company by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear on the Security Register on the record date for such interest payment.

accept for exchange Registrable Securities or portions thereof validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Exchange Offer; and

The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to complete the Exchange Offer as provided above and shall comply with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and other applicable laws and regulations in connection with the Exchange Offer.
 
(b)           In the event that (i) the Company determines that the Exchange Offer Registration provided for in Section 2(a) above is not permitted or may not be completed as soon as practicable after the last Exchange Date because it would violate any applicable law or applicable interpretations of the Staff, (ii) the Exchange Offer is not for any other reason completed by January 31, 2009 or (iii) upon receipt of a written request (a "Shelf Request") from any Initial Purchaser representing that it holds Registrable Securities that are or were ineligible to be exchanged in the Exchange Offer, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be filed as soon as practicable after such determination, date or Shelf Request, as the case may be, a Shelf Registration Statement providing for the sale of all the Registrable Securities by the Holders thereof and to have such Shelf Registration Statement become effective.
 
In the event that the Company is required to file a Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to clause (iii) of the preceding paragraph, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to file and have become effective both an Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(a) with respect to all Registrable Securities and a Shelf Registration Statement (which may be a combined Registration Statement with the Exchange Offer Registration Statement) with respect to offers and sales of Registrable Securities held by the Initial Purchasers after completion of the Exchange Offer.
The Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective until two years from the Issue Date or such shorter period that will terminate when all the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement (the "Shelf Effectiveness Period").  The Company further agrees to supplement or amend the Shelf Registration Statement, the related Prospectus and any Free Writing Prospectus if required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company for such Shelf Registration Statement or by the Securities Act or by any other rules and regulations thereunder or if reasonably requested by a Holder of Registrable Securities with respect to information relating to such Holder, and to use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such amendment to become effective, if required, and such Shelf Registration Statement, Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus, as the case may be, to become usable as soon as thereafter practicable.  The Company agrees to furnish to the Holders of Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement copies of any such supplement or amendment  promptly after its being used or filed with the SEC.
 
(c)           The Company shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection with any registration pursuant to Section 2(a) or Section 2(b) hereof.  Each Holder shall pay all underwriting discounts and commissions, brokerage commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of such Holder's Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement.
 
(d)           An Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has been declared effective by the SEC.  A Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has been declared effective by the SEC or is automatically effective upon filing with the SEC as provided by Rule 462 under the Securities Act.
 
(e)           In the event that either the Exchange Offer is not completed or the Shelf Registration Statement, if required pursuant to Section 2(b)(i) or 2(b)(ii) hereof, does not become effective on or prior to January 31, 2009 (the "Target Registration Date"), the interest rate on the Registrable Securities will be increased by (i) 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period immediately following the Target Registration Date and (ii) an additional 0.25% per annum with respect to each subsequent 90-day period, up to a maximum of 0.50% per annum, in each case until the earliest of (1) the Exchange Offer being completed, (2) the Shelf Registration Statement, if required hereby, becoming effective and (3) two years from the Issue Date, at which time the increased interest shall cease to accrue.  In the event that the Company receives a Shelf Request pursuant to Section 2(b)(iii), and the Shelf Registration Statement required to be filed thereby does not become effective by the later of (x) the Target Registration
Date or (y) 90 days after the delivery of such Shelf Request (such later date, the "Shelf Additional Interest Date"), then the interest rate on the Registrable Securities to be covered by the Shelf Registration Statement will be increased by (i) 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period immediately following the Shelf Additional Interest Date and (ii) an additional 0.25% per annum with respect to each subsequent 90-day period, up to a maximum of 0.50% per annum, in each case until the earlier of (a)  the Shelf Registration Statement becoming effective and (b) the Securities becoming freely tradable under the Securities Act, at which time the increased interest shall cease to accrue.
 
If the Shelf Registration Statement, if required hereby, has become effective and thereafter either ceases to be effective or the Prospectus contained therein ceases to be usable, in each case whether or not permitted by this Agreement, at any time during the Shelf Effectiveness Period, and such failure to remain effective or usable exists for more than 30 consecutive calendar days in any 12 month period or 60 calendar days, whether or not consecutive, in any 12-month period, then the interest rate on the Registrable Securities will be increased by 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period commencing on the 31st day in such 12-month period or the 61st day in such 12 month period, as applicable, and (ii) an additional 0.25% per annum with respect to each subsequent 90-day period and ending, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) on such date that the Shelf Registration Statement has again become effective or the Prospectus again becomes usable, up to a maximum of 0.50% per annum, at which time the increased interest rate shall cease to accrue.
 
(f)            Without limiting the remedies available to the Initial Purchasers and the Holders, the Company acknowledges that any failure by the Company to comply with its obligations under Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof may result in material irreparable injury to the Initial Purchasers or the Holders for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of any such failure, the Initial Purchasers or any Holder may seek such relief as may be required to specifically enforce the Company's obligations under Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof.

provided
general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction or (3) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction if it is not so subject;
 
(vi)          in the case of a Shelf Registration, notify each Holder of Registrable Securities and counsel for such Holders and counsel for the Initial Purchasers promptly and, if requested by any such Holder or counsel, confirm such advice in writing (1) when a Registration Statement has become effective, when any post-effective amendment thereto has been filed, becomes effective and when any Free Writing Prospectus has been filed or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or any Free Writing Prospectus has been filed, (2) of any request by the SEC or any state securities authority for amendments and supplements to a Registration Statement, Prospectus or any Free Writing Prospectus or for additional information after the Registration Statement has become effective, (3) of the issuance by the SEC or any state securities authority of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, including the receipt by the Company of any notice of objection of the SEC to the use of a Shelf Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act, (4) if, between the applicable effective date of a Shelf Registration Statement and the closing of any sale of Registrable Securities covered thereby, the representations and warranties of the Company contained in any underwriting agreement, securities sales agreement or other similar agreement, if any, relating to an offering of such Registrable Securities cease to be true and correct in all material respects or if the Company receives any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation of any proceeding for such purpose, (5) of the happening of any event during the period a Shelf Registration Statement is effective that makes any statement made in such Shelf Registration Statement or the related Prospectus untrue in any material respect or that requires the making of any changes in such Shelf Registration Statement, Prospectus or any Free Writing Prospectus in order to make the statements therein not misleading and (6) of any determination by the Company that a post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or any Free Writing Prospectus would be appropriate;

(x)            in the case of a Shelf Registration, upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section 3(a)(v)(5) hereof, use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC a supplement or post-effective amendment to such Shelf Registration Statement or the related Prospectus or any Free Writing Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of the Registrable Securities, such Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus, as the case may be, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and the Company shall notify the Holders of Registrable Securities to suspend use of the Prospectus or any Free Writing Prospectus as promptly as practicable after the occurrence of such an event, and such Holders hereby agree to suspend use of the Prospectus or any Free Writing Prospectus until the Company has amended or supplemented the Prospectus or any Free Writing Prospectus to correct such misstatement or omission;
 
(xi)           a reasonable time prior to the filing of any Registration Statement, any Prospectus or any Free Writing Prospectus, any amendment to a Registration Statement, amendment or supplement to a Prospectus or any Free Writing Prospectus or of any document that is to be incorporated by reference into a Registration Statement or a Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus, as the case may be, after initial filing of a Registration Statement, provide copies of such document to the Initial Purchasers and their counsel (and, in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, to the Holders of Registrable Securities and their counsel) and make such of the representatives of the Company as shall be reasonably requested by the Initial Purchasers or their counsel (and, in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Holders of Registrable Securities or their counsel) available for discussion of such document; and the Company shall not, at any time after initial filing of a Registration Statement, use or file any Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus, any amendment of or supplement to a Registration Statement or a Prospectus or a Free Writing Prospectus, or any document that is to be incorporated by reference into a Registration Statement, a Prospectus or a Free Writing Prospectus of which the Initial Purchasers and their counsel (and, in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Holders of
Registrable Securities and their counsel) shall not have previously been advised and furnished a copy or to which the Initial Purchasers or their counsel (and, in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Holders of Registrable Securities or their counsel) shall reasonably object;
 
(xii)         obtain a CUSIP number for all Exchange Securities or Registrable Securities, as the case may be, not later than the initial effective date of a Registration Statement;
 
(xiii)        cause the Indenture to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act in connection with the registration of the Exchange Securities or Registrable Securities, as the case may be; cooperate with the Trustee and the Holders to effect such changes to the Indenture as may be required for the Indenture to be so qualified in accordance with the terms of the Trust Indenture Act; and execute, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Trustee to execute, all documents as may be required to effect such changes and all other forms and documents required to be filed with the SEC to enable the Indenture to be so qualified in a timely manner;
 
(xiv)        in the case of a Shelf Registration, make available for inspection by a representative of the Holders of the Registrable Securities (an "Inspector"), any Underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement, any attorneys and accountants designated by a majority of the Holders of Registrable Securities to be included in such Shelf Registration and any attorneys and accountants designated by such Underwriter, at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner, all pertinent financial and other records, documents and properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, and cause the respective officers, directors and employees of the Company to supply all information reasonably requested by any such Inspector, Underwriter, attorney or accountant in connection with a Shelf Registration Statement; that if any such information is identified by the Company as being confidential or proprietary, each Person receiving such information shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary to protect the confidentiality of such information to the extent such action is otherwise not inconsistent with, an impairment of or in derogation of the rights and interests of any Inspector, Holder or Underwriter);
provided
 
(xv)         if reasonably requested by any Holder of Registrable Securities covered by a Shelf Registration Statement, promptly include or incorporate in a Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information with respect to such Holder as such Holder reasonably requests to be included or incorporated therein and make all required filings of such Prospectus supplement or such post-effective amendment as soon as the Company has received notification of the matters to be so included or incorporated in such filing; and
 
(xvi)        in the case of a Shelf Registration, enter into such customary agreements and take all such other actions in connection therewith (including
those reasonably requested by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement) in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities including, but not limited to, an Underwritten Offering and in such connection, (1) to the extent possible, make such representations and warranties to the Holders and any Underwriters of such Registrable Securities with respect to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries and the Registration Statement, Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus and documents incorporated by reference or deemed incorporated by reference, if any, in each case, in form, substance and scope as are customarily made by issuers to underwriters in underwritten offerings and confirm the same if and when requested, (2) obtain opinions of counsel to the Company (which counsel and opinions, in form, scope and substance, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Holders and such Underwriters and their respective counsel) addressed to each selling Holder and Underwriter of Registrable Securities, covering the matters customarily covered in opinions requested in underwritten offerings, (3) obtain "comfort" letters from the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company (and, if necessary, any other independent registered public accounting firm of any subsidiary of the Company, or of any business acquired by the Company for which financial statements and financial data are or are required to be included in the Registration Statement) addressed to each selling Holder (to the extent permitted by applicable professional standards) and Underwriter of Registrable Securities, such letters to be in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "comfort" letters in connection with underwritten offerings, including but not limited to financial information contained in any preliminary prospectus, Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus and (4) deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Registrable Securities being sold or the Underwriters, and which are customarily delivered in underwritten offerings, to evidence the continued validity of the representations and warranties of the Company made pursuant to clause (1) above and to evidence compliance with any customary conditions contained in an underwriting agreement.
 
(b)           In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Company may require each Holder of Registrable Securities to furnish to the Company such information regarding such Holder and the proposed disposition by such Holder of such Registrable Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in writing.
 
(c)           In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, each Holder of Registrable Securities covered in such Shelf Registration Statement agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(a)(v)(3) or 3(a)(v)(5) hereof, such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus contemplated
by Section 3(a)(ix) hereof and, if so directed by the Company, such Holder will deliver to the Company all copies in its possession, other than permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities that is current at the time of receipt of such notice.
 
(d)           If the Company shall give any notice to suspend the disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement, the Company shall extend the period during which such Registration Statement shall be maintained effective pursuant to this Agreement by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when the Holders of such Registrable Securities shall have received copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus necessary to resume such dispositions. The Company may give any such notice only twice during any 365-day period and any such suspensions shall not exceed 30 days for each suspension and there shall not be more than two suspensions in effect during any 365-day period.
 
(e)           The Holders of Registrable Securities covered by a Shelf Registration Statement who desire to do so may sell such Registrable Securities in an Underwritten Offering.  In any such Underwritten Offering, the investment bank or investment banks and manager or managers (each an "Underwriter") that will administer the offering will be selected by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Registrable Securities included in such offering and shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company.
 
4.             .  (a)  The Staff has taken the position that any broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account in the Exchange Offer in exchange for Securities that were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making or other trading activities (a "Participating Broker-Dealer") may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act and must deliver a prospectus  meeting the requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.
Participation of Broker-Dealers in Exchange Offer
 
The Company understands that it is the Staff's position that if the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement includes a plan of distribution containing a statement to the above effect and the means by which Participating Broker-Dealers may resell the Exchange Securities, without naming the Participating Broker-Dealers or specifying the amount of Exchange Securities owned by them, such Prospectus may be delivered by Participating Broker-Dealers to satisfy their prospectus delivery obligation under the Securities Act in connection with resales of Exchange Securities for their own accounts, so long as the Prospectus otherwise meets the requirements of the Securities Act.
(b)           In light of the above, and notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company agrees to amend or supplement the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement for a period of up to 90 days after the last Exchange Date (as such period may be extended pursuant to Section 3(d) of this Agreement) if requested by the Initial Purchasers or by one or more Participating Broker-Dealers, in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of any Exchange Securities by Participating Broker-Dealers consistent with the positions of the Staff recited in Section 4(a) above.  The Company further agrees that Participating Broker-Dealers shall be authorized to deliver such Prospectus during such period in connection with the resales contemplated by this Section 4.
 
(c)           The Initial Purchasers shall have no liability to the Company or any Holder with respect to any request that they may make pursuant to Section 4(b) above.
 
5.             .  (a)  The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser and each Holder, their respective affiliates, directors and officers and each Person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser or any Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, legal fees and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, (1) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or (2) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" ("Issuer Information") filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Initial Purchaser or information relating to any Holder furnished to the Company in writing through JPMorgan or Goldman, Sachs & Co. or any selling Holder, respectively, expressly for use therein.  In connection with any Underwritten Offering permitted by Section 3, the Company will also indemnify the Underwriters, if any, selling brokers, dealers and similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, their respective affiliates and each Person who controls such Persons (within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Holders, if requested in connection with any
Indemnification and Contribution
Registration Statement, any Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus or any Issuer Information.
 
(b)           Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Initial Purchasers and the other selling Holders, the directors of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each Person, if any, who controls the Company, any Initial Purchaser and any other selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement, any Prospectus and any Free Writing Prospectus. In connection with any Underwritten Offering permitted by Section 3, the Underwriters will enter into agreements providing for the indemnification of the Company in form and substance customary for underwritten offerings of that type.
 
(c)           If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any Person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to Section 5(a) or 5(b) above, such Person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred.  In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the
provided
that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 5 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 5.  If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person
provided
further
Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.  It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Any such separate firm (x) for any Initial Purchaser, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control Persons of such Initial Purchaser shall be designated in writing jointly by JPMorgan and Goldman, Sachs & Co., (y) for any Holder, its directors and officers and any control Persons of such Holder shall be designated in writing by the Majority Holders and (z) in all other cases shall be designated in writing by the Company.  The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) the Indemnifying Person shall not have responded to such written request, (ii) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request on terms and conditions not less favorable than those set forth in such written request and (iii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.  No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (B) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
 
(e)           If the indemnification provided for in Section 5(a), 5(b) and 5(c) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company from the offering of the Securities and the Exchange Securities, on the one hand, and by the Holders from receiving Securities or Exchange Securities
registered under the Securities Act, on the other hand, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Holders on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Holders on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Holders and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
(f)            The Company and the Holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5 were determined by allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (e) above.  The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (e) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, in no event shall a Holder be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Holders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 5 are several and not joint.

(g)           The remedies provided for in this Section 5 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
 
(h)           The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 5 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers or any Holder or any Person controlling any Initial Purchaser or any Holder, or by or on behalf of the Company or the officers or directors of or any Person controlling the Company, (iii) acceptance of any of the Exchange Securities and (iv) any sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement.

General
 
(a)            The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the Initial Purchasers that (i) the rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of any other outstanding securities issued or guaranteed by the Company under any other agreement and (ii) the Company has not entered into, or on or after the date of this Agreement will not enter into, any agreement that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders of Registrable Securities in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof.
