Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
 
 
As reported on its Current Reports on Form 8-K and Form 8-K/A filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on May 8, 2008, May 13, 2008, and June 12, 2008 (the "Previous Reports"), Best Buy Co., Inc. ("Best Buy" or the "registrant") entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (the "SPA"), dated May 7, 2008, with The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC ("The Carphone Warehouse").  Under the terms of the SPA, The Carphone Warehouse contributed certain assets and liabilities into a newly-formed company registered in England and Wales named Best Buy International Limited ("BBY Europe"), in exchange for all of the ordinary shares of BBY Europe.  On June 30, 2008,  all conditions to closing under the SPA were met and Best Buy completed the transaction wherein its wholly-owned subsidiary, Best Buy Distributions Limited, acquired 50% of such ordinary shares of BBY Europe from CPW for an aggregate purchase price of $2.167 billion.  The effective acquisition date for accounting purposes is the close of business June 28, 2008, the end of CPW's fiscal first quarter.
 
The registrant financed the purchase of BBY Europe shares with approximately $1.1 billion of cash on hand, approximately $600 million of borrowings under its $2.5 billion revolving credit agreement and approximately $500 million from a debt offering exempt from registration, the terms of which were disclosed in the registrant's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 24, 2008, which is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.01.
 
The registrant plans to consolidate the financial results of BBY Europe from the effective date of acquisition on a two-month lag to align with CPW's quarterly reporting periods.  As a result, the financial results of BBY Europe will not be reported in the registrant's consolidated financial statements until its fiscal third quarter ending on November 29, 2008.  The registrant intends to disclose any significant intervening events related to BBY Europe that occur in its fiscal quarters and materially affect its consolidated financial statements.
 
Pursuant to a Shareholders Agreement with CPW and its wholly-owned subsidiary,
CPW Retail Holdings Limited,
Best Buy's designees to the BBY Europe board of directors have ultimate approval rights over select BBY Europe senior management positions and the annual capital and operating budgets of BBY Europe. In addition, pursuant to a 350 million Facility Agreement between the registrant, CPW and BBY Europe, CPW agreed to provide a revolving credit facility to BBY Europe. The registrant is named as the guarantor under the agreement, limited to 50% of the amount outstanding.

In addition, to the extent BBY Hold Co desires to change the entity classification for an entity, and the only way to effect that change is to reorganize the entity into a newly created entity, CPW shall consent to that reorganization, unless CPW can identify a negative tax consequence to CPW or any other entity within the JV Group as a result of taking such action.
 
1.2
          
Under the terms of the SPA, JV Co was, prior to the Closing Date, and will be immediately after the Closing Date, considered a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  The parties hereby covenant and agree to refrain from taking any action that is inconsistent with treating JV Co as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1.3
          
JV Co will make an election under section 6231(a)(1)(B)(ii) of the Code to have the TEFRA audit provisions of subchapter C of chapter 23 of the Code apply to JV Co.   BBY Distributions shall be the "tax matters partner" within the meaning of section 6231 of the Code.

1.5
          
The income, gains, taxes, deductions and credits of the JV Co shall, except as otherwise provided herein, be allocated to each of the JV Shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes in proportion to the Ordinary Shares owned by each JV Shareholder.
 
1.6
          
In accordance with section 704(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, income, gain, loss, and deduction with respect to any property contributed to the capital of JV Co shall, solely for U.S. federal income tax purposes, be allocated among the JV Shareholders so as to take account of any variation between the adjusted basis of such property to the JV Co for U.S. federal income tax purposes and its initial Book Value.  In the event that the Book Value of any asset is subsequently adjusted in accordance with subparagraph (b) or subparagraph (d) of the definition of Book Value, any allocation of income, gain, loss, and deduction with respect to such asset shall thereafter take account of any variation between the adjusted tax basis of the asset to the JV Co and its Book Value in the same manner as under section 704(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.
 
(a)
                                 
Except as provided in paragraph 1.6(b), below, JV Co shall elect to apply the "traditional method" described in Treas. Reg.  1.704-3(b) with respect to any contributed property or any property whose Book Value is subsequently adjusted pursuant to subparagraph (b) or subparagraph (d) of the definition of Book Value.
 
(b)
                                
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the parties agree and understand that a section 754 election was made for JV Co and applied to the sale of the 50% interest in the JV Co that occurred on the closing of the SPA.  As a result of that election, BBY Distributions was entitled to increase the basis in one-half of the property owned by JV Co for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  The parties hereby agree that JV Co shall elect to apply the "remedial method" described in Treas. Reg. 1.704-3(d) with respect to any asset subject to section 197(f) of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 
(c)
                                 
Allocations pursuant to this paragraph 1.6 are solely for purposes of U.S. federal, state and local taxes and shall not affect, or in any way be taken into account in computing, any JV Shareholder's share of net profits, net losses, or distributions pursuant to any provision of this Agreement.
 
1.7
          
If any gain recognized on the disposition of the JV Co's property represents "recapture" of previously allocated deductions by virtue of the application of Section 1245 of the Code or Section 1250 of the Code ("Recapture Gain"), such Recapture Gain shall be allocated, solely for income tax purposes, in accordance with Treas. Reg. 1.1245-1(e)(2) and Treas. Reg.  1.1250-1(f).
 
1.8
          
Tax credits and tax credit recapture and any similar items shall be allocated (solely for US. federal income tax purposes) among the JV Shareholders in a manner determined by the tax matters member, provided such allocation is in compliance with the Code and
regulations issued pursuant thereto (including, without limitation, Treas. Reg.  1.704-1(b)(4)(ii)).
 
1.9           CPW undertakes that it will not, and undertakes that it will procure that each CPW Group Company and member of the JV Group will not, take any action which so far as it is aware could result in any income, profit or gains of any member of the JV Group (other than the US Subsidiary) or any BBY Group Company being subject to Tax in the US.
 
1.10         The parties acknowledge and agree that, by virtue of BBY Distribution's ownership of the JV Group, certain U.S. tax and information filings will have to be prepared for the members of the JV Group as required under the Code for which CPW will have responsibility under paragraph 1.1 of Part A of Schedule 8.  As such, the parties agree to cooperate to share such information as is required in order to enable the timely filing of those returns.
 
1.11         Where under this paragraph any member of the JV Group is required to take, enter into election or take any other action for US tax purposes, BBY Hold Co shall set out in writing any such action that is required and give the relevant member of the JV Group reasonable notice of such action.
 
1.12         BBY Hold Co shall indemnify, or procure that the relevant JV Co or any member of the CPW Group is indemnified in respect of any Tax liability incurred by any member of the JV Co Group or the CPW Group as a result of taking such action.
 
1.13         BBY Distributions agrees to consult with CPW to the extent the provisions in this Part B cause any UK tax or other non-US tax issues for JV Co or the JV Group and BBY Distributions and CPW will work together to ensure that the JV Co and the JV Group remain as tax efficient as possible; provided that the provisions in this Part B shall not force the JV Co or the JV Group into actions that cause material tax inefficiencies for any of the relevant companies outside the US.

(a)           The initial Book Value of any asset contributed by a JV Shareholder to the JV Co shall be the gross fair market value of such asset, and such value shall be determined by the tax matters partner.
 
(b)           The Book Values of all JV Co assets shall be adjusted to equal their respective gross fair market values, as determined by the tax matters partner, as of the following times: (i) the acquisition of any additional interest in the JV Co by any new or existing JV Shareholder either in exchange for more than a capital contribution or in exchange for the provision of services for the benefit of the JV Co; (ii) the distribution by JV Co to a JV Shareholder of more than a amount of JV Co property, unless all JV Shareholders receive simultaneous distributions of undivided interests in the distributed property in proportion to their interests in the JV Co; and (iii) the liquidation of the JV Co within the meaning of Treas. Reg.  1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g).

Reg.  1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m).

If a Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, the amount of the payment due from the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall be increased to an amount which (after making any Tax Deduction) leaves an amount equal to the payment which would have been due if no Tax Deduction had been required.

The Company and the Guarantor is not required to make an increased payment to the Lender under (c) above for a Tax Deduction in respect of tax imposed by the United Kingdom from a payment of interest on the Loan, if on the date on which the payment falls due, the Company or the Guarantor is able to demonstrate that the payment could have been made to the Lender without the Tax Deduction if it was a Qualifying Lender, but on that date the Lender is not or has ceased to be a Qualifying Lender other than as a result of any change after the date it became a Party under this Agreement in (or the interpretation, administration, or application of) any law or double taxation agreement, or any published practice or concession of any relevant taxing authority.

If the Company or the Guarantor makes a Tax Payment and the Lender determines that:
 
(a)
                                 
a Tax Credit is attributable either to an increased payment of which that Tax Payment forms part, or to that Tax Payment; and
 
(b)
                                
the Lender has obtained, utilised and retained that Tax Credit,

Exhibit 99
 
 
June 30, 2008
 
For immediate release
 
June 30, 2008 (London and Minneapolis)  The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC and Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE: BBY) today announced the closing of their transaction to create a new venture aimed at addressing the evolving consumer electronics needs of European consumers, following the passing of resolutions relating to the transaction with Best buy at the extraordinary general meeting held today by The Carphone Warehouse.
 
As a result of the passing of these resolutions, all conditions relating to the completion of the transaction have now been satisfied or waived, and the transaction is therefore now complete in all respects.
 
To effect the transaction, earlier today Best Buy paid The Carphone Warehouse cash consideration of approximately 1.1 billion ($2.1 billion).The consideration was comprised of cash on hand of $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion of debt proceeds. The debt proceeds were derived from bank line borrowings of approximately $500 million and five-year senior note proceeds of approximately $500 million. The effective date of the transaction is the close of business June 28, 2008, the end of The Carphone Warehouse's fiscal first quarter.
 
The closing of the transaction marks the formation of a new company comprised of The Carphone Warehouse's existing retail and mobile service businesses. These businesses consist of more than 2,400 stores in nine European countries under the Carphone Warehouse and Phone House brands and The Carphone Warehouse's share of its existing relationships with Best Buy. Both The Carphone Warehouse and Best Buy each now own 50 percent of the new company. The Carphone Warehouse continues to own 100 percent of its fixed line telecoms business in the U.K., comprising TalkTalk, AOL Broadband and Opal; and its share of the Virgin Mobile France joint venture.
