Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
(e) On August 5, 2008, the Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Best Buy Co., Inc. (the "registrant"), approved special, performance-based long-term incentive awards ("Performance Awards") for 20 officers. The objective of the Performance Awards is to provide the recipients with additional incentive to achieve specified revenue and profit growth for the registrant. Among the recipients were the following three individuals, each of whom were "named executive officers" pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K for purposes of the registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 1, 2008:
 
                 
Brian J. Dunn, President and Chief Operating Officer;
                 
Robert A. Willett, Chief Executive Officer  Best Buy International and Chief Information Officer; and
                 
James L. Muehlbauer, Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial Officer.
 
The Performance Awards were granted in addition to the annual incentive awards typically granted by the registrant.
 
Concurrent with the approval of the Performance Awards, the Committee also approved stock option awards for employees who are eligible to participate in the registrant's Long-Term Incentive Program, except that the stock option awards were not granted to any Performance Award recipients. The stock option awards were intended to link leader success with the creation of shareholder value and to encourage growth across the organization. Bradbury H. Anderson, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, requested that he not be granted any stock option awards.
 
The Performance Awards were made in the form of performance shares pursuant to the registrant's 2004 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan, as amended ("Omnibus Plan"). The Committee approved a target amount of performance shares for each individual's Performance Award. The Performance Awards represent, at the time of vesting, the right to receive one share of the registrant's Common Stock for each performance share earned pursuant to the Performance Awards.
 
There are two separate, but partially overlapping, performance periods covered by the Performance Awards. The first period began on June 1, 2008, and ends on February 26, 2011 (end of fiscal 2011). The second period also began on June 1, 2008, but ends on March 3, 2012 (end of fiscal 2012). One-half of the total Performance Award opportunity is available with respect to each performance period.
 
The percentage of the target amount of a Performance Award that is earned for each performance period will be determined based on the application of an incentive formula approved by the Committee. The incentive formula includes the registrant's compound annual revenue growth, profit growth and comparable store sales metrics, as follows:
 
 
The maximum amount of the Performance Award that could be earned by an individual is 250% of his or her target amount. In order for any portion of a Performance Award to be earned, the registrant must achieve a minimum of 7% compound annual revenue growth (coupled with a minimum 17% compound annual profit growth) or 7%
 
compound annual profit growth (coupled with a minimum 14% compound annual revenue growth) during one of the performance periods. The target and maximum award amounts that may be earned by each of the named executive officers pursuant to the Performance Awards are as follows:
 
 
The earned amount of the Performance Awards, if any, will vest at the end of each respective performance period and will be distributed in accordance with the Omnibus Plan and the Performance Share Award Agreement. Except in the case of a qualified retirement or a change in control, individuals must be employed with the registrant through February 26, 2011, to earn any award. If an individual's employment is terminated, except in the case of a qualified retirement or a change in control, prior to February 26, 2011, all rights with respect to the Performance Award will be immediately and irrevocably forfeited. Upon a qualified retirement, as defined in the Performance Share Award Agreement, the Performance Award will vest on a pro-rated basis at the end of each performance period. Upon the occurrence of certain events such as death, disability, retirement or voluntary termination of employment during the last year of the second performance period, the amount of the award that may be earned with respect to the second performance period will be pro-rated. If there is a change-in-control of the registrant, as defined in the Performance Share Award Agreement, prior to March 3, 2012, the unvested portion of the Performance Awards will immediately vest and each individual will acquire the right to receive 20% of the unvested portion of the maximum amount of the Performance Award. To the extent the Performance Award is earned and vested, each individual will also be entitled to receive accrued cash dividend payments, from June 1, 2008, associated with the number of shares of Common Stock delivered.
 
The foregoing is a summary of the Performance Awards and does not purport to be complete. The foregoing is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of Performance Share Award Agreement issued in connection with the Performance Awards. A copy of the form of Performance Share Award Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

IV.
General Provisions Applicable to Performance Shares
                               
 
.  The dollar amount of any dividends or other distributions (whether in cash or property other than equity securities of Best Buy) that would have been paid on any Performance Shares you earn under this Agreement ("Dividend Equivalents"), if the Performance Shares had been issued at the beginning of either the Component 1 Performance Period or the Component 2 Performance Period, as applicable (collectively, the "Performance Periods"), will be credited by Best Buy to a bookkeeping account in its records as of the date when the number of earned and vested Performance Shares is finally determined for each of
4.1
Dividend Equivalents
                              
 
the Performance Periods; and from time to time thereafter until those Performance Shares are issued to you or forfeited.  At each time when Best Buy issues Performance Shares to you, Best Buy will pay you from that account an amount of cash equal to all Dividend Equivalents that have been credited to the account with respect to those Performance Shares during the period before those Performance Shares are issued, without interest, less any applicable tax withholding amounts; provided, however, that if any of the Performance Shares are forfeited as described in Section 4.4 or Article V, then all rights to any Dividend Equivalents that would have been paid on those forfeited Performance Shares will also be forfeited.
 
.  In addition to the requirements for earning and vesting of Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents, your rights to receive and retain any Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents (whether or not earned and otherwise vested) earned under this Agreement are subject to the following restrictions:
4.2
Restrictions
                              
 
(a)
                                 
all rights to Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents are subject to forfeiture as provided in Section 4.4 and Article V and the Plan; and
 
(b)
                                
your rights to receive Performance Shares that have not yet been issued (whether or not earned and vested), and any related Dividend Equivalents, may not be sold, assigned, transferred or pledged at any time before they are delivered.  You may not transfer the rights to receive any unissued Performance Shares, or any related Dividend Equivalents, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and any such attempted transfer will be void.
 
  If (a) the Annual Plan Limitation (as defined in the following paragraph) applies to you for a taxable year, and (b) the value of any Performance Shares and any related Dividend Equivalents (as of the day before the scheduled issuance date) otherwise deliverable to you under this Agreement (including any amounts deferred under this paragraph) during that taxable year, in combination with all other Performance Awards (if any) payable to you in that taxable year, would exceed the Annual Plan Limitation, the delivery of such excess amounts of Performance Shares and any related Dividend Equivalents under this Agreement shall be deferred until the first business day of your next taxable year in which any of the excess Performance Shares and related Dividend Equivalents may be delivered to you without exceeding the Annual Plan Limitation.
4.3
Annual Plan Limitation on Delivery of Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents.
                              
 
The dollar amount of the "Annual Plan Limitation," and any requirements for determining whether or not it will apply to you (as a covered employee defined under Section 162(m) of the Code, or otherwise) at a particular time, shall be determined as of August 15, 2010, by reference to either or both of the Plan provisions described in the following subparagraphs (a) and (b), to the extent such provisions apply to you:
 
(a)
                                 
if you have not been continuously employed by the Company Group through August 15, 2010, the "Annual Plan Limitation" shall mean the terms and conditions of Section 4(d)(ii) of the Plan, as in effect on June 1, 2008; or
 
(b)
                                
if you have been continuously employed by the Company Group through August 15, 2010, the "Annual Plan Limitation" shall mean the terms and conditions of Section 4(d)(ii) of the Plan (or any successor provision), as in effect for this Award on August 15, 2010, after any approval by the shareholders of Best Buy that may be required under Code Section 162(m) if those terms and conditions are amended after June 1, 2008; provided, however, that if, as of August 15, 2010, any number of the Performance Shares to be issued under this Agreement is both calculable and substantially certain to be issued when due under this Agreement, the "Annual Plan Limitation" shall mean, with respect to that number of Performance Shares and any related Dividend Equivalents, the terms and conditions of Section 4(d)(ii) of the Plan, as in effect on June 1, 2008.
 
 
The determination of the "Annual Plan Limitation" as of August 15, 2010, as provided in the preceding paragraph, is intended to constitute a deferred initial election of payment terms for performance-based compensation, as permitted under Code Section 409A.  For purposes of this Agreement, the Annual Plan Limitation, to the extent it will apply to you under the Plan, is also intended to qualify any Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents that you may earn under this Agreement as qualified performance-based compensation defined under Code Section 162(m).  The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be interpreted in a manner that carries out both of those intentions.
 
.  Your employment with the Company Group may be terminated by your employer at any time for any reason (or no reason).  Upon any termination of your employment with the Company Group, or upon any Change in Control, in either case before or after the end of either or both of the Performance Periods (each, an "Incomplete Performance Period"), your right to earn and receive any Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents for each Incomplete Performance Period shall be measured and vested as follows or, to the extent applicable, forfeited under this Section 4.4 or Article V:
4.4
Termination of Employment or Change in Control
                              
 
(a)
                                 
Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e) of this Section 4.4 (concerning a Change in Control), if your employment with the Company Group ends for any reason  (other than your Qualified Retirement) on or before the last day of the Component 1 Performance Period, your right to earn any Performance Shares under this Agreement will be forfeited.
 
(b)
                                
Except as otherwise provided in Article V or any of subsections (d), (e) or (f) of this Section 4.4, if your Qualified Retirement occurred during an Incomplete Performance Period, or if your employment ended for any reason during the last 12 months of the Component 2 Performance Period, the Performance Goals for earning Performance Shares will continue to be measured during any remaining portion of each such Incomplete Performance Period, and no Performance Shares relating to such Incomplete Performance Period will be treated as earned or vested until such date as the Committee determines in its sole discretion (i) whether and to what extent you have earned any Performance Shares relating to the Incomplete Performance Period because any of the applicable Performance Goals set forth in the attached Performance Goals Schedule have been met to any extent, as set forth in Sections 2.1 and 3.1; and (ii) whether and to what extent any Performance Shares you have earned for the Incomplete Performance Period are vested and payable in accordance with the following subsection (c).
 
(c)
                                 
Except as otherwise provided in Article V or any of subsections (d), (e) or (f) of this Section 4.4, if your Qualified Retirement occurred during an Incomplete Performance Period, or if your employment ended for any reason during the last 12 months of the Component 2 Performance Period, and if the Committee determines after the end of the each Incomplete Performance Period that you have earned any Performance Shares for the Incomplete Performance Period because the applicable Performance Goals have been met to any extent for the Incomplete Performance Period, then the number of Performance Shares that you have earned for the Incomplete Performance Period will become vested on a prorated basis, as of the date of your employment termination, in the ratio of (i) the number of Whole Months you completed during the Incomplete Performance Period and before that termination date to (ii) the total number of months originally scheduled in the Incomplete Performance Period; any vested portion of the Performance Shares you earned during the Incomplete Performance Period will be issued, subject to any deferred issuance required by Section 4.3, as provided in Section 3.3; any Dividend Equivalents related to those Performance Shares will be paid under Section 4.1; and any Performance Shares that are not vested under this subsection (c) will be forfeited.
 
 
(d)
                                
If, before or after the end of the Performance Periods, your employment terminates for Cause (as defined in the Addendum hereto) or for any reason at a time when you could have been discharged for Cause by any member of the Company Group, your rights to earn and receive any Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents that have not yet been delivered to you will be immediately and irrevocably forfeited.
 
(e)
                                 
Except as otherwise provided in Article V or the preceding subsection (d), if a Change in Control occurs before the end of either or both of the Performance Periods (each, an "Incomplete Performance Period"), (i) 20% of the Performance Shares relating to each Incomplete Performance Period will be treated as fully earned, without regard to completion of the Incomplete Performance Period or any actual achievement of the Performance Goals for the Incomplete Performance Period; (ii) if you are employed by any member of the Company Group at the opening of business on the date of the Change in Control, such earned 20% of such Performance Shares will be 100% vested; (iii) if you are not then employed by the Company Group, a percentage of the Component 2 Performance Shares that are included in such earned 20% of the Performance Shares will be vested to the extent (if any) provided in subsection (c) of this Section 4.4; and (iv) subject to any deferred issuance required by Section 4.3, such earned and vested Performance Shares will be issued to you within 60 days after such Change in Control, and any Dividend Equivalents related to the earned and vested Performance Shares issued under this subsection will then be paid under Section 4.1.
 
(f)
                                   
If a Change in Control occurs during an Incomplete Performance Period, your rights to earn and receive any Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents relating to that Incomplete Performance Period will be immediately and irrevocably forfeited, except to the extent (if any) that you are eligible to receive a portion of your Performance Shares under the preceding subsection (e).
 
(g)
                                
Except as otherwise provided in Article V or the preceding subsection (d), any Change in Control or termination of your employment with the Company Group that occurs on or after the last day of a Performance Period will not adversely affect your rights to any Performance Shares that have been earned and are vested for that completed Performance Period.
 
.  You will not have any of the rights of a shareholder with respect to any Performance Shares that have not been issued to you.
4.5
No Shareholder Rights
                              
 
.  You are liable for any federal and state income or other taxes applicable upon the grant of the Performance Shares, the earning, vesting or issuance of any Performance Shares and the payment of Dividend Equivalents, and your subsequent disposition of any Performance Shares; and you acknowledge that you should consult with your own tax advisor regarding the applicable tax consequences of those events.  When any Performance Shares have become earned and vested, but are not yet issuable under the other provisions of this Agreement, Best Buy will withhold from those Performance Shares (and treat as issued to you for tax purposes) a number of Performance Shares having a fair market value equal to the amount of all applicable FICA, FUTA and income taxes required by Best Buy to be withheld upon such event; and Best Buy shall pay to you, subject to applicable tax withholding, any Dividend Equivalents related to the withheld Performance Shares.  Upon the issuance of any Performance Shares at a time after they have become vested, Best Buy will withhold from any related Dividend Equivalents the amount of all applicable income taxes required by Best Buy to be withheld upon such issuance and, to the extent necessary, will withhold from those Performance Shares (and treat as issued to you for tax purposes) a number of Performance Shares having a fair market value equal to any amount of such income tax withholding that exceeds the Dividend Equivalent amount then payable.

.  By accepting this Award, you agree to the restrictions and agreements contained in Sections 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 of this Article V (the "Restrictive Covenants"), and also Section 5.6; and you agree that the Restrictive Covenants and the forfeiture remedies described in Section 5.1 and 5.6 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the Company Group.
V.
Restrictive Covenants and Forfeiture Remedy
                                   
 
.  In consideration of the terms of this Award and in recognition of the fact that you will receive Confidential Information during your employment with the Company Group, you agree to be bound by the following Restrictive Covenants and agree that if you violate any provision of such Restrictive Covenants, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:
5.1
Forfeiture for Violation of Restrictive Covenants
                              
 
(a)
                                 
all unvested Performance Shares, together with any vested Performance Shares that have not been issued and any Performance Shares that were issued within one year before or within one year after the date on which such violation occurred (the "Forfeited Shares"), all unpaid or paid Dividend Equivalents relating to such Forfeited Shares, and all dividends received or due on such Forfeited Shares, shall be forfeited and any rights thereto shall become null and void; and
 
(b)
                                
you shall pay to Best Buy, upon demand, an amount equal to (i) the proceeds you have received from any sales of Forfeited Shares, the payment of any related Dividend Equivalents, and any dividends received on the sold Forfeited Shares; and (ii) if you still hold all or any part of the Forfeited Shares at the time such demand is made by Best Buy, the aggregate Fair Market Value of such Forfeited Shares as of the date of issuance of such Forfeited Shares, any proceeds you have received from any Dividend Equivalents related to such Forfeited Share, and any dividends you have received on such Forfeited Shares.
 
You also agree that the forfeiture and repayment provisions of this Section 5.1 may be used to enforce the forfeiture and repayment provisions of Section 5.6.
 
In consideration of your opportunity to earn Performance Shares, you acknowledge that the Company Group operates in a competitive environment and that the Company Group has a substantial interest in protecting its Confidential Information; and you agree, during your employment with the Company Group and thereafter, to maintain the confidentiality of the Company Group's Confidential Information and to use such Confidential Information for the exclusive benefit of the Company Group.
5.2
Confidentiality Restrictive Covenant.

You acknowledge the uncertainty of the law in this respect and expressly stipulate that this Agreement is to be given the construction that renders its provisions valid and enforceable to the maximum extent (not exceeding its express terms) possible under applicable law.
