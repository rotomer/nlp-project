Item 8.01               Other Events
 
On September 15, 2008, Best Buy Co., Inc., a Minnesota corporation ("Best Buy") and Napster, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Napster") announced that they had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of September 14, 2008, by and among Best Buy, Puma Cat Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Best Buy ("Purchaser"), and Napster.  The total transaction value will be approximately $121 million (or $54 million net of approximately $67 million in cash and short-term investments of Napster as of June 30, 2008). The joint press release announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and subject to the conditions set forth therein,   Purchaser will commence a cash tender offer to acquire all of Napster's issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and all stock purchase rights associated with such shares (collectively, the "Shares"), at a price of $2.65 per share, without any interest or accrued dividends, net to the seller in cash (the "Offer").  Following completion of the Offer, Purchaser will be merged with and into Napster, with Napster as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Best Buy (the "Merger").  In the Merger, each outstanding Share (other than Shares held by Purchaser or Best Buy, treasury Shares, which will be cancelled, and Shares held by stockholders, if any, who properly exercise appraisal rights) will be converted into the right to receive the cash amount payable in the Offer without interest.  The Offer and the Merger are subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including, among others, a condition to the Offer that the number of shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn before the expiration date of the Offer represent, together with any Shares owned, directly or indirectly, by Best Buy, in the aggregate, more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding Shares on a fully-diluted basis on the date of purchase, and the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976.
 
In the Merger Agreement, Napster granted to Purchaser an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up Stock Option") to purchase a number of newly-issued Shares that, when added to the number of Shares collectively owned by Best Buy and Purchaser immediately following the completion of the Offer, equals one share more than 90% of the issued and outstanding Shares (assuming the issuance of the Shares issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Stock Option), at a purchase price per share equal to the price paid per Share in the Offer.  The Top-Up Stock Option may only be exercised if exercise thereof will result in the ownership by Best Buy and Purchaser of one share more than 90% of the issued and outstanding Shares.  The Top-Up Stock Option cannot be exercised if the number of Shares to be issued would exceed the number authorized in Napster's certificate of incorporation or require the approval of Napster stockholders under applicable law or under the regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market.
 
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for each of Best Buy, Purchaser and Napster, and further provides that, upon termination of the Merger
 
Agreement under certain circumstances, Napster would be required to pay to Best Buy a termination fee of $3 million.
 
In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Best Buy and Purchaser entered into a Shareholder Support Agreement with each of Napster's directors and certain officers, pursuant to which such individuals, in their capacities as stockholders, have agreed to tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer and vote in favor of the Merger.  Such stockholders in the aggregate beneficially own Shares that are eligible to be tendered in the Offer representing approximately 1.4% of the Shares outstanding (Shares held by such stockholders that may be voted in favor of the Merger represent approximately 5.9% of the Shares outstanding).
 
The foregoing descriptions of the Merger Agreement and the Shareholder Support Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement and the Shareholder Support Agreement, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.
 
The Offer has not yet commenced, and this report is not an offer to buy or the solicitation of an offer to sell any securities.  The Offer will be made only pursuant to an offer to purchase and related materials that Best Buy intends to file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on Schedule TO.  Napster also intends to file a solicitation/recommendation statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer.  Napster stockholders and other investors should read these materials carefully because they contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the Offer.  Napster stockholders and other investors will be able to obtain copies of these materials without charge from the SEC through the SEC's Web site at www.sec.gov, from the Information Agent named in the tender offer documents, from Best Buy (with respect to documents filed by Best Buy with the SEC), or from Napster (with respect to documents filed by Napster with the SEC).

Exhibit 99.1
 
MINNEAPOLIS AND LOS ANGELES (Sept. 15, 2008)  Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY) and Napster, Inc. (NASDAQ:NAPS) announced today that the two companies have entered into a definitive merger agreement for Best Buy to commence a tender offer for all outstanding Napster shares at a price of $2.65 per share in cash.  The transaction, with an aggregate purchase price of $121 million (or $54 million net of approximately $67 million in cash and investments of Napster as of June 30, 2008), is subject to customary closing conditions, including the tender of a number of Napster shares that constitutes a majority of Napster's outstanding shares of common stock (on a fully-diluted basis).  The transaction is expected to close during the fourth calendar quarter.  The transaction has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of Napster, and Napster's directors and executive officers have agreed, in their capacities as stockholders, to tender their Napster shares and otherwise support the transaction.
 
The proposed acquisition includes Napster's approximately 700,000 digital entertainment subscribers, its Web-based customer service platform, and innovative mobile capabilities.  In conjunction with the definitive merger agreement, Napster
CEO Chris Gorog and key members of senior management of Napster have entered into employment agreements, effective at closing, pursuant to which they have agreed to continue as the Napster leadership post-acquisition.
 
Best Buy believes that Napster has one of the most comprehensive and easy-to-use music offerings in the industry, including streaming music, music subscriptions, the ability to purchase individual tracks, albums and mobile offers. Napster has approximately 140 employees, with its headquarters in Los Angeles.  At this time, Best Buy does not plan to relocate Napster's headquarters or to make significant changes in personnel.
 
"This transaction offers Best Buy a recognized platform for enhancing our capabilities in the digital media space and building new, recurring relationships with customers," said Brian Dunn, President and COO of Best Buy. "Over time we hope to strengthen our offerings to consumers, who we believe will increasingly seek devices and solutions that enable them to access their content wherever, whenever and however they want."
 
Best Buy intends to use Napster's capabilities and digital subscriber base to reach new customers with an enhanced experience for exploring and selecting music and other digital entertainment products over an increasing array of devices.  Best Buy believes the combined capabilities of the two companies will allow it to build stronger relationships with customers, expand the number of subscribers, and capture recurring revenue by offering ongoing value over a mobile digital platform.
 
"We believe Napster brings us excellent capabilities in the mobility space, as well as international operations and an established team of technology experts," said Dave Morrish, Executive Vice President  Connected Digital Solutions of Best Buy. "We can foresee Napster acting as a platform for accelerating our growth in the emerging industry of digital entertainment, beyond music subscriptions. We're very excited to add these capabilities to leverage our existing relationships with the labels, the studios, and the hardware providers. We believe Napster will be an outstanding addition to our already robust portfolio of partners and offerings in the digital music space."
 
"We believe Best Buy will be an ideal partner for Napster and are very excited by the benefits that this transaction delivers to our shareholders, partners and employees.  Best Buy is uniquely positioned to benefit from Napster's digital entertainment distribution platform.  We
are looking forward to combining our digital media capabilities with Best Buy's resources and global network to extend our digital content platforms," said Chris Gorog, chairman and CEO of Napster.
 
Under the terms of the definitive merger agreement, Best Buy will commence a cash tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Napster common stock for $2.65 per share in cash, with a supporting recommendation from the Napster Board of Directors.  The closing of the tender offer is subject to customary terms and conditions, including the tender of a number of shares that constitutes a majority of Napster's outstanding shares of common stock (on a fully diluted basis) and expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act. The agreement also provides for the parties to effect, subject to customary conditions, a merger to be completed following the completion of the tender offer which would result in all shares not tendered in the tender offer (other than shares held by Best Buy, treasury shares, and shares held by Napster shareholders, if any, who properly exercise appraisal rights) being converted into the right to receive $2.65 per share in cash. The directors and certain officers of Napster have entered into agreements with Best Buy pursuant to which they have agreed to tender their shares in connection with the tender offer contemplated by the merger agreement and otherwise support the transaction.
 
Napster, which recently launched one of the world's largest MP3 stores, had fiscal 2008 revenue of $127.5 million, an increase of 15 percent over the prior fiscal year; a loss of $16.5 million, an improvement compared with a loss of $36.8 million the prior fiscal year; and positive cash flow for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008.
 
Best Buy intends to complete the acquisition using available cash.  UBS Investment Bank served as the exclusive financial advisor to Napster, and Napster is represented by O'Melveny & Myers LLP.  Best Buy is represented by Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi L.L.P.
