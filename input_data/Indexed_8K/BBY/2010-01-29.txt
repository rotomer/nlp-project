On January 29, 2010, The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC ("CPW") announced its
proposal to demerge
and separate CPW into two new holding companies to be listed on the London Stock Exchange: TalkTalk Group PLC, which will be the holding company for the fixed line voice and broadband telecommunications business, and New Carphone Warehouse PLC ("New Carphone Warehouse"), which includes CPW's 50% ownership interest in Best Buy Europe Distributions Limited ("Best Buy Europe"). Best Buy Europe was formed on June 30, 2008, as a venture, which is 50% owned by Best Buy Co., Inc. ("Best Buy" or the "registrant") and 50% owned by CPW.  Best Buy Europe will form part of the New Carphone Warehouse listed company.
 
Upon approval of the transaction by CPW's shareholders and if all other conditions are satisfied, the demerger and associated transactions are expected to be consummated on March 29, 2010, with secondary listing trading of New Carphone Warehouse shares on the London Stock Exchange to commence on that date.  In addition, the shareholder agreement between CPW and the registrant governing the Best Buy Europe venture, previously filed by the registrant on a Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on July 3, 2008,  will be assigned from CPW to New Carphone Warehouse upon approval of the transaction by CPW's shareholders.  The registrant and CPW have also agreed to conforming amendments to the shareholder agreement and related agreements between the parties in order to enable the demerger and associated transactions.
 
 
On January 27, 2010, Best Buy Europe entered into a 125 million (or $202 million based on the exchange rate in effect on January 27, 2010) revolving credit facility agreement (the "Agreement") with Best Buy Distributions Limited (the "Subsidiary"), a subsidiary of Best Buy, and CPW to finance the working capital needs of Best Buy Europe. Amounts to be borrowed under the Agreement will be provided for equally by the Subsidiary via intercompany transactions and by CPW.  The Agreement expires in March 2013.  Upon approval of the demerger transaction described above, New Carphone Warehouse will replace CPW as a lender under the Agreement.
 
Interest rates under the Agreement are variable, based on London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin of 3.00%. The Agreement establishes a commitment fee of 1.5% on unused available capacity.
 
The Agreement is not guaranteed by Best Buy Co., Inc., or any subsidiary nor does it provide for any recourse to Best Buy Co., Inc.
 
The foregoing description of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Agreement which is attached hereto as Exhibit No. 4.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Concurrent with the execution of the Agreement, the registrant's existing revolving credit facility available to Best Buy Europe with CPW as lender was terminated.  At January 27, 2010, no amounts were outstanding under this revolving credit facility, which was originally scheduled to expire in March 2013.
 
 
The news release issued on January 29, 2010, by CPW is furnished as Exhibit No. 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
A condition to closing the transaction is the approval of CPW's shareholders at a general meeting scheduled to be held on February 24, 2010.  The prospectus describing the demerger proposal and associated transactions and notice of general meeting was distributed to CPW's shareholders on January 29, 2010. A copy of the prospectus will be filed with an amendment to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Some of the matters discussed in this Current Report on Form 8-K (including Exhibit 99.1) constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include statements other than those made solely with respect to historical fact and are based on the intent, belief or current expectations of the registrant and its management.  The registrant's business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that might cause actual results to differ materially from those projected by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include, but are not limited to, the risk factors set forth in the registrant's filings with the SEC.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Calculation of interest
 
The rate of interest on each Loan for each Interest Period is the percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate of the:
 
(a)
                                 
Margin; and

If the Company fails to pay any amount payable by it under a Finance Document on its due date, interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from the due date up to the date of actual payment (both before and after judgment) at a rate which is the sum of 1 per cent. and the rate which would have been payable if the overdue amount had, during the period of non-payment, constituted a Loan in the currency of the overdue amount for successive Interest Periods, each of a duration selected by the Lenders (acting reasonably).  Any interest accruing under this Clause 8.3shall be immediately payable by the Company on demand of the Lenders.
 
(b)
                                
However if the overdue amount is principal of a Loan and became due on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period relating to that Loan, the first Interest Period applicable to that overdue amount shall be of a duration equal to the unexpired portion of that Interest Period and the rate of interest on that overdue amount for that Interest Period shall be the sum of 1 per cent. and the rate applicable to it immediately before it became due.
 
(c)

Scheme Circular and Prospectuses
 
As part of the process of separating its
fixed line voice and broadband telecommunications
business from the rest of its operations, Carphone Warehouse is today announcing that the circular, which details the structure of the proposed demerger and scheme of arrangement (the "Proposals"), along with the prospectuses which relate to TalkTalk and New Carphone Warehouse's introduction to the Official List and admission to trading on the London Stock Exchange, are available on Carphone Warehouse's website at http://demergerdocuments.cpwplc.co.uk
 
The circular is today being posted to shareholders and together with the prospectuses, gives details on the process by which the Proposals will be effected and also provides key information on the two businesses, TalkTalk and New Carphone Warehouse (to be renamed Carphone Warehouse Group plc on or around 25
th
 March 2010). The circular contains notices convening the Court Meeting and the General Meeting at which the approvals for the Proposals will be sought. The Carphone Warehouse General Meeting and Court Meeting are scheduled for 24 February 2010. If the Proposals are approved by shareholders and the court, TalkTalk and New Carphone Warehouse are expected to start trading as separate companies on 29 March 2010.
 
Effect of the Proposals
 
The Proposals will create two new holding companies, TalkTalk (which will be the holding company for the fixed line voice and broadband telecommunications business) and New Carphone Warehouse (which will comprise a 50 per cent interest in the Best Buy Europe Group, a 47.5 per cent interest in Virgin Mobile France, a property portfolio consisting of four freehold properties, and a number of minority investments in other businesses).
 
For the year ended 31 March 2009, New Carphone Warehouse reported Headline profit before taxation of 17 million and as at 30 September 2009 had gross assets of 547 million.  For the year ended 31 March 2009, TalkTalk reported Headline profit before taxation of 115 million and as at 30 September 2009 had gross assets of 1,533 million.
 
The Carphone Warehouse Board believes that the separation of the TalkTalk business and the New Carphone Warehouse business will enhance value for Carphone Warehouse shareholders by creating significant opportunities and benefits, including:
 
                 
allowing enhanced focus from two experienced management teams to maximise the respective performance of the New Carphone Warehouse Business and the TalkTalk Business;
 
                 
creating two distinct listed companies, each with clear market valuations, offering discrete investment propositions for existing Carphone Warehouse Shareholders and new investors;
 
                 
creating clearer market profiles with investors and enabling investors to assess better the individual strengths of the New Carphone Warehouse Business and the TalkTalk Business and more accurately evaluate each company's performance compared to companies in the same or similar industries;
 
                 
providing flexibility for New Carphone Warehouse and TalkTalk to pursue independent long-term growth strategies appropriate to their respective markets and differing characteristics and opportunities;
 
                 
enabling a more efficient and transparent capital allocation and providing TalkTalk and New Carphone Warehouse with direct access to capital markets to finance expansion and growth opportunities, as appropriate; and
 
                 
creating capital structures and shareholder distribution policies appropriate for the future requirements of each business.
 
The TalkTalk shares are expected to be admitted to the Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities by way of a primary listing (to be renamed a premium listing with effect from 6 April 2010).
 
The New Carphone Warehouse shares are expected to be admitted to the Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities by way of a secondary listing (to be renamed a standard listing with effect from 6 April 2010), reflecting the fact that New Carphone Warehouse does not control a majority of its assets and is not, therefore, eligible for a primary listing.  A company whose shares are listed on the Official List by way of a secondary listing has fewer obligations under the Listing Rules than a company with a primary listing.  If New Carphone Warehouse is listed on the Official List by way of a secondary listing, as intended, it will not be required to comply with the provisions of Chapters 7, 8, 10, 11, 12 or 13 of the Listing Rules or the requirements of Chapter 9 of the Listing Rules which apply only to companies which obtain a primary listing (although there are certain provisions of Chapter 9 of the Listing Rules which do apply to companies with a secondary listing and with which New Carphone Warehouse will be required to comply). Despite this however, New Carphone Warehouse intends to comply on a voluntary basis with Chapters 7 to 13 of the Listing Rules, including Chapter 10 on significant transactions and Chapter 11 on related party transactions.  The disclosure requirements under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules will continue to apply to New Carphone Warehouse and New Carphone Warehouse shareholders.  As New Carphone Warehouse will be listed by way of a secondary listing, it will not be eligible for FTSE Index Inclusion.
 
Board of Directors
 
We are also announcing the appointment of a new Board of Directors for TalkTalk and New Carphone Warehouse.
 
TalkTalk will be chaired by Charles Dunstone.  Its proposed chief executive officer will be Dido Harding, who will be joining the TalkTalk group prior to the completion of the demerger process,  Amy Stirling will be chief financial officer, having been chief financial officer of the TalkTalk business since 2006, David Goldie will be group commercial director having joined the TalkTalk group in 2002,  Roger Taylor (non-executive deputy chairman), John Gildersleeve, John Allwood, Brent Hoberman and Jessica Burley have been appointed as non-executive directors of TalkTalk.
 
New Carphone Warehouse will be chaired by Charles Dunstone.  Its chief executive officer will be Roger Taylor, who has been chief financial officer of Carphone Warehouse since 2000.  Nigel Langstaff will be chief financial officer, having been group director of finance for Carphone Warehouse since 2002.  John
 
Gildersleeve (non-executive deputy chairman), John Allwood and Baroness Morgan have been appointed as non-executive directors of New Carphone Warehouse.
 
Basis of the Demerger
 
Conditional on the Proposals being approved, shareholders will receive in exchange for their existing Carphone Warehouse ordinary shares (which will be cancelled):
 
Each Carphone Warehouse shareholder will ultimately own very close to the same proportion of the ordinary share capital in each of TalkTalk and New Carphone Warehouse as they did previously in Carphone Warehouse.
 
Special Interim Dividend
 
As announced with the trading update on 19
th
 January, the Board is proposing to pay a special dividend in March 2010 of 3.2p, in substitution of the full year final dividend that would otherwise have been paid to The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC shareholders in July 2010.
