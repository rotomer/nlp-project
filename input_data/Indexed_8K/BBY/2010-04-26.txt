Charles Dunstone, Chairman, said:
 
"We have ended 2010 with another strong performance and given our third upgrade in six months. Best Buy Mobile US is out-performing even our expectations. Carphone Warehouse Europe continues to trade strongly with like-for-like revenue up 3.0% in the fourth quarter. Our full year results are ahead of expectations and our operating free cash flow is well ahead and represents a transformational improvement on the prior year.
 
"The demerger is now successfully completed, and we are moving into our next phase of growth. Our vision of the Connected World' resonates with customers, as do our principles of impartial advice and knowledgeable service. This Friday, we open our first UK Best Buy Big Box' store; Best Buy Mobile continues to show good potential in the US; Carphone Warehouse Europe continues to roll out its Wireless World' format; and Virgin Mobile France is now moving into profit.
 
"The macro environment will undoubtedly present challenges but we are well positioned in each of our businesses and we are targeting 40% to 45% EPS growth for our 2011 financial year with further strong cash generation in both of our joint ventures."
 
Fourth quarter trading
 
Carphone Warehouse Europe
Overall connections were down 2.9% from 2.94m to 2.86m (or down 5.2% without adjusting for the comparable calendar quarter) reflecting the strong pre-pay driven comparative (connections in Q4 2009 +12%). However the quality of connections continues to improve with smartphone penetration driving an increase in revenue per connection. Quarter four like-for-like revenue growth on a constant currency basis was up 3.0% (up 1.8% at actual currency).
 
Best Buy Mobile US
Best Buy Mobile is performing strongly, demonstrating the appeal of its differentiated offer to US consumers. It delivered another impressive quarter with total connections up 34.2% to 1.43m (2009:1.07m).
 
Virgin Mobile France
Virgin Mobile France's customer base is now 1.7m with net growth of 30,000 in the quarter. The business' scale and efficiency enabled it to achieve both profitability and positive cash flow in this quarter. We continue to be on track to meet our medium term target of 2m customers. The Tele2 business has been migrated onto Virgin Mobile network terms and head office integration is well underway.
 
Indicative full year financials
 
Group
Group revenue and opex are in-line with expectations whilst EPS of c.8-8.4p (2009: 4.0p) is substantially ahead of guidance given at the start of the year and in January, reflecting the strong out-performance in Best Buy Europe. The Group had 100m of cash at March 2010 following demerger.
 
Best Buy Europe
Carphone Warehouse Europe delivered 18% EBIT growth to 114m (2009: 97m) reflecting good smart phone sales, strengthened gross margins and cost savings resulting from the reorganisation programme undertaken in the first half of 2009.
 
Best Buy Mobile US has had a transformational year and contributed 46m to Best Buy Europe's EBIT, up from 8m last year, reflecting strong top line growth and operational leverage.
 
Opex investment in Best Buy UK (Big Box') was 21m, broadly in-line with guidance.
 
The Group's share of Best Buy Europe's net income was c.47m (2009: 28m), after interest of c.16m (2009: 12m) and taxation of c.28m (2009: 29m).
 
Operating free cash flow before Big Box' investment was c.170m, reflecting reduced capex and much improved working capital. Best Buy Europe ended the year with net funds of 60m compared to net debt of 47m at March 2009.
 
Virgin Mobile France
The Group's share of Virgin Mobile France (47.5% stake) was a 9m loss. Following the acquisition of Tele2 in December the synergies from this combination are beginning to have a meaningful impact on cash flow and profit contribution.
 
Outlook and guidance for the year to March 2011
 
As part of our presentation to analysts and investors today, we will be giving updated financial guidance for the coming year.  The key elements of this guidance are set out below.
 
Best Buy Europe
We anticipate a like-for-like revenue performance of +0-3% from the Carphone Warehouse Europe business, with gross margins continuing to strengthen. Space growth is expected to be 0-1%, with a flat to slightly lower overall store count offset by continued investment in our new, larger store format (over 100 Wireless World' stores by March 2011). We expect a further decline in revenue from Germany as the business continues to migrate from a service provision model to a more typical retail model.
 
At the EBIT level we expect 15-20% growth at Carphone Warehouse Europe, 15-20% growth in Best Buy Mobile profit share and a loss of 40m-45m for Best Buy UK (Big Box').
 
We expect the interest charge to be similar to the year to March 2010, and the effective tax rate to be 24-25%.
 
Reflecting the increased investment in launching Best Buy Big Box' stores and the cost of the debt facilities, we expect the overall post-tax share of profits from Best Buy Europe to be in the 47m - 50m range.
 
We expect Carphone Warehouse Europe and Best Buy Mobile US to generate operating free cash flow of approximately 170m-180m, reflecting capex of 70m-80m and working capital absorption of 20m-30m. In addition to operating cash costs, Best Buy Europe plans to invest a further 35m-40m in Big Box' capex in 2010-11. Working capital absorption in the Big Box' business is expected to be minimal.
 
Virgin Mobile France
Proforma annualised revenue for FY 2010, including Tele2, was c.350m. We expect this to grow by 10-15% in FY 2011. The target EBIT margin for FY 2011 is 5% to 6% with a year-end run-rate of closer to 10%, both pre amortisation of acquisition intangibles arising on the Tele2 deal. We expect the group share of Virgin Mobile France post-tax Headline profit to be c.5m.
 
PLC costs
We expect an increase of 2m-3m in PLC costs from c.6m in FY 2010 reflecting the move from a share of old' Carphone Warehouse PLC infrastructure to a standalone PLC position. We expect that PLC cash costs will be substantially covered by rental income and interest income.
 
Dividend policy
As previously indicated, the Group does not expect to pay dividends in the short-term, as it is anticipated that cash generated by its principal investments will be reinvested to drive further growth.
