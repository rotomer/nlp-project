Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
 
(a)
             
On September 20, 2010, the Board of Directors of Best Buy Co., Inc. (the "registrant") approved an amendment to the registrant's Amended and Restated By-Laws, to adopt advance notice provisions related to the submission of shareholder proposals and director nominations to the Board of Directors.  As a result of the revisions to the advance notice provisions, in order for a shareholder to nominate a director or submit other business at the Company's 2011 Regular Meeting of Shareholders (without such business being included in the Company's 2011 proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), a shareholder must comply with the new advance notice provisions set forth in Article 2, Section 9, including without limitation providing written notice of such nomination and other business to the Company's Secretary no later than 120 days prior to the one year anniversary of the preceding year's regular meeting and no earlier than 150 days prior to that date (or no more than the 10
th
 day following announcement of any special meeting).  These procedures include specific requirements as to the form of notice and content of the proposal and detailed disclosures regarding the shareholder's ownership and voting interests in Company securities, as well as descriptions of all agreements, arrangements and understandings between the proposing shareholder and other shareholders.  Shareholders wishing to include a shareholder proposal in the Company's 2011 proxy materials are required to comply with Rule 14a-8.
 
A copy of the Company's Amended and Restated By-Laws, amended as of September 20, 2010, is being filed as Exhibit No. 3.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

QUORUM

The presence at any meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote at a meeting, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.

At any such adjourned meeting at which the required number of voting shares shall be represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed. If a quorum is present when a duly called or held meeting is convened the shareholders present may continue to transact business until adjournment, even though the withdrawal of a number of shareholders originally present leaves less than the proportion or number otherwise required for a quorum.
 
Section 7
 
RECORD DATE
.
 
The Board of Directors may fix a time not exceeding sixty (60) days preceding the date of any meeting of the shareholders as a record date for the determination of the shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after any record date so fixed.

Each shareholder shall have one (1) vote for each share having voting power standing in his/her name on the books of the corporation. Shares owned by two or more shareholders may be voted by any one of them unless the corporation receives written notice, addressed to the Board of Directors at the address of the principal executive office, from any one of them denying the authority of that person to vote those shares. Upon the demand of any shareholder, the vote for directors or the vote upon any question before the meeting shall be by ballot. All elections shall be had and all questions decided by a majority vote of those present except as otherwise required by Chapter 302A or the corporation's Articles of Incorporation.
