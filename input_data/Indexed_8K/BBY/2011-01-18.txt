Best Buy UK online successfully launched with strong performance to date
                 
Significant customer base growth at Virgin Mobile France with net adds of 74,000
                 
Reiterating financial guidance for the full year with EPS expected to be at the top end of the previously stated 13.5p-14.0p range
 
Roger Taylor, CEO, said:
 
"We've delivered another good quarter, we're again raising our guidance for our profit share from Best Buy Mobile US and we now expect full year earnings per share to be at the top end of the range we gave in November. CPW Europe has continued to perform well in a
Christmas quarter where sales are traditionally much more weighted towards prepay handsets, the segment where smartphone penetration is still low, and where there have been high levels of price deflation in basic handsets. Best Buy Mobile US continues its strong momentum, demonstrating its winning formula. The online launch at Best Buy UK has gone well, adding to the strong customer satisfaction with our Big Box' stores, where our planned roll-out continues. Our other joint venture, Virgin Mobile France, is well on track to deliver growth and results in line with guidance."
 
Best Buy Europe
 
Best Buy Europe is our 50:50 joint venture with Best Buy Co., Inc. and comprises:
 
                 
CPW Europe  predominantly trading under the Carphone Warehouse and Phone House brands;
                 
a profit sharing agreement in Best Buy Mobile US, Best Buy's mobile phone retailing operations in the US; and
                 
Best Buy UK, the newly launched Big Box' consumer electronics stores and online platform in the UK, branded Best Buy.
 
CPW Europe
 
Like-for-like sales growth was 0.7%, reflecting continued strong smartphone sales in the postpay segment. As anticipated, penetration of smartphones into the prepay category remained relatively modest, and prepay connections were down year-on-year, causing a drop of 7.1% in overall connections. Consistent with previous quarters the UK business performed strongly, with LFL sales growth of 2.3%, helping to offset tough economic conditions in a number of continental European markets.
The Wireless World' store format continues to perform well, bringing customers the latest and best products and services that the Connected World' has to offer. We currently have 73 Wireless World' stores and remain on course to reach our target of 100 by March 2011.
 
Best Buy Mobile US
 
Best Buy Mobile delivered another impressive quarter, with connections growth of 33.6% to 2.2m. The business continues to increase the retail estate, rolling out new stand-alone stores and benefitting from an increased allocation of space within Best Buy's Big Box' stores. In driving market share, Best Buy Mobile has also invested in promotional activity and marketing, pioneering innovative propositions in the US market.
 
Best Buy Mobile now has 1,099 stores within a Best Buy store and 158 stand-alone stores. As previously guided, it is well on track to have over 175 stores by the end of the current financial year.
 
Because of Best Buy Mobile's continued momentum, we are again increasing our guidance for the full-year profit share, to 90m-100m (previously 85m-95m).
 
Best Buy UK
 
The performance of our first six Big Box' stores in their launch year has reaffirmed our belief in the substantial opportunity that exists within the consumer electronics market for our innovative, deep service-based proposition. The online offering launched before Christmas has seen a strong performance to date, particularly in home appliances, and is generating a high number of customers visiting the interactive site to get information and inspiration about technology before buying. Our planned store roll-out continues and we are broadening our online range throughout the coming year.
 
Virgin Mobile France
 
Revenue at Virgin Mobile France, in which we have a 47.1% stake, is in-line with expectations at 94m for the quarter. As anticipated in November, following the successful integration of Tele2 in the first half, Virgin Mobile France has refocused on customer acquisition and had a successful Christmas. Net additions in the quarter were 74,000 (41,000 year-to-date), buoyed by the launch of high-end smartphones, bringing the customer base to 1.76m and placing the business on track to meet the guidance of 50,000-100,000 net adds for the full year.
 
Outlook
 
Whilst we remain cautious on the economic environment across Europe, we are well positioned to take advantage of the strong product cycle in mobile phones and the Connected World'. We remain confident in achieving the full year guidance that we set out with our interim results in November and now expect EPS to be at the top end of the existing 13.5p-14.0p range.
