On July 27, 2011, Best Buy Europe,
a venture between Best Buy Co., Inc. ("Best Buy" or the "registrant") and Carphone Warehouse Group plc ("CPW"), which is owned 50% by the registrant, entered into a 400 million ($654 million based on the exchange rate in effect on July 27, 2011) unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (the "Agreement") with ING Bank N.V., London Branch, as agent, and a syndicate of banks to finance the working capital needs of Best Buy Europe. The Agreement is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of Best Buy Europe. The Agreement expires on July 27, 2015.
 
Interest rates under the Agreement are variable, based on the London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin based on Best Buy Europe's fixed charges coverage ratio (currently 1.4%). The Agreement includes a commitment fee of 40% of the applicable margin on unused available capacity, as well as a utilization fee ranging from 0.0% to 0.5% of the aggregate amount outstanding based on the percentage of the aggregate amount outstanding  to the total revolving credit facility. The Agreement also required an initial arrangement fee of 0.75%.
 
The Agreement is not guaranteed by Best Buy Co., Inc., or any subsidiary, nor does it provide for any recourse to the registrant. The Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants. Among other things, these covenants restrict or prohibit Best Buy Europe's ability to incur certain types or amounts of indebtedness, make material changes in the nature of its business, dispose of material assets, make guarantees, or engage in a change in control transaction. The Agreement also contains covenants that require Best Buy Europe to comply with a maximum annual leverage ratio and a maximum fixed charges coverage ratio.
 
The foregoing description of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Agreement which is attached hereto as Exhibit No. 4.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
The Agreement described above will replace the 350 million receivables financing facility (the "ERF") between a subsidiary of Best Buy Europe and a syndicate of banks, including Barclays Bank PLC acting as administrative agent. The ERF was originally scheduled to expire on July 3, 2012. The Agreement will also replace Best Buy Europe's 125 million revolving credit facility (the "RCF") with one of the registrant's subsidiaries and CPW as lenders. The RCF was originally scheduled to expire in March 2013.
 
Some of the matters discussed in this Current Report on Form 8-K (including Exhibit 4.1) constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include statements other than those made solely with respect to historical fact and are based on the intent, belief or current expectations of CPW, the registrant and/or its management. The registrant's business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that might cause actual results to differ materially from those projected by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include, but are not limited to, the risk factors set forth in the registrant's filings with the SEC.

(b)
                                
If any overdue amount consists of all or part of a Loan which became due on a day which was not the last day of an Interest Period relating to that Loan:
 
(i)
                                    
the first Interest Period for that overdue amount shall have a duration equal to the unexpired portion of the current Interest Period relating to that Loan; and
 
(ii)
                                 
the rate of interest applying to the overdue amount during that first Interest Period shall be one per cent. higher than the rate which would have applied if the overdue amount had not become due.
 
(c)
                                
Default interest (if unpaid) arising on an overdue amount will be compounded with the overdue amount at the end of each Interest Period applicable to that overdue amount but will remain immediately due and payable.

that Finance Party has obtained, utilised and retained that Tax Credit,
 
the Finance Party shall pay an amount to the Obligor which that Finance Party determines will leave it (after that payment) in the same after-Tax position as it would have been in had the Tax Payment not been required to be made by the Obligor.

Lender Status Confirmation
 
Each Lender which becomes a Party to this Agreement after the date of this Agreement shall indicate, in the Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement or Increase Confirmation which it executes on becoming a Party, and for the benefit of the Agent and without liability to any Obligor, which of the following categories it falls in:

not a Qualifying Lender;

a Treaty Lender.
 
If a New Lender fails to indicate its status in accordance with this Clause 13.5 then such New Lender shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement (including by each Obligor) as if it is not a Qualifying Lender until such time as it notifies the Agent which category applies (and the Agent, upon receipt of such notification, shall inform the Company).  For the avoidance of doubt, a Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement or Increase Confirmation shall not be invalidated by any failure of a Lender to comply with this Clause 13.5.

The Recipient will promptly pay to the Subject Party an amount equal to any credit or repayment obtained by the Recipient from the relevant tax authority which the Recipient reasonably determines is in respect of such VAT.

(a)
                                 
guarantees to each Finance Party punctual performance by each Borrower of all that Borrower's obligations under the Finance Documents;
 
(b)

(c)
                                 
agrees with each Finance Party that if any obligation guaranteed by it is or becomes unenforceable, invalid or illegal, it will, as an independent and primary obligation, indemnify that Finance Party immediately on demand against any cost, loss or liability it incurs as a result of a Borrower not paying any amount which would, but for such unenforceability, invalidity or illegality, have been payable by it under any Finance Document on the date when it would have been due.  The amount payable by a Guarantor under this indemnity will not exceed the amount it would have had to pay under this Clause 18 if the amount claimed had been recoverable on the basis of a guarantee.

Continuing guarantee

If any discharge, release or arrangement (whether in respect of the obligations of any Obligor or any security for those obligations or otherwise) is made by a Finance Party in whole or in part on the basis of any payment, security or other disposition which is avoided or must be restored in insolvency, liquidation, administration or otherwise, without limitation, then the liability of each Guarantor under this Clause 18 will continue or be reinstated as if the discharge, release or arrangement had not occurred.
 
18.4
                       
Waiver of defences
 
The obligations of each Guarantor under this Clause 18 will not be affected by an act, omission, matter or thing which, but for this Clause, would reduce, release or prejudice any of its obligations under this Clause 18 (without limitation and whether or not known to it or any Finance Party) including:
 
(a)
                                 
any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with, any Obligor or other person;

(c)
                                 
the taking, variation, compromise, exchange, renewal or release of, or refusal or neglect to perfect, take up or enforce, any rights against, or security over assets of, any Obligor or other person or any non-presentation or non-observance of any
 
formality or other requirement in respect of any instrument or any failure to realise the full value of any security;

any incapacity or lack of power, authority or legal personality of or dissolution or change in the members or status of an Obligor or any other person;
 
(e)
          
any amendment, novation, supplement, extension, restatement (however fundamental and whether or not more onerous) or replacement of any Finance Document or any other document or security including without limitation any change in the purpose of, any extension of or any increase in any facility or the addition of any new facility under any Finance Document or other document or security;
 
(f)
           
any unenforceability, illegality or invalidity of any obligation of any person under any Finance Document or any other document or security; or
 
(g)
          
any insolvency or similar proceedings.
 
18.5
       
Immediate recourse
 
Each Guarantor waives any right it may have of first requiring any Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) to proceed against or enforce any other rights or security or claim payment from any person before claiming from that Guarantor under this Clause 18.  This waiver applies irrespective of any law or any provision of a Finance Document to the contrary.
 
18.6
       
Appropriations
 
Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full, each Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) may:
 
(a)
          
refrain from applying or enforcing any other moneys, security or rights held or received by that Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) in respect of those amounts, or apply and enforce the same in such manner and order as it sees fit (whether against those amounts or otherwise) and no Guarantor shall be entitled to the benefit of the same; and
 
(b)
          
hold in an interest-bearing suspense account any moneys received from any Guarantor or on account of any Guarantor's liability under this Clause 18.
 
18.7
       
Deferral of Guarantors' rights
 
Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full and unless the Agent otherwise directs, no Guarantor will exercise any rights which it may have by reason of performance by it of its obligations under the Finance Documents or by reason of any amount being payable, or liability arising, under this Clause 18:
 
(a)
          
to be indemnified by an Obligor;
 
(b)
          
to claim any contribution from any other guarantor of any Obligor's obligations under the Finance Documents;
 
(c)
          
to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Finance Parties under the Finance Documents or of any other guarantee or security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, the Finance Documents by any Finance Party;
 
(d)
          
to bring legal or other proceedings for an order requiring any Obligor to make any payment, or perform any obligation, in respect of which any Guarantor has given a guarantee, undertaking or indemnity under Clause 18.1 ();
Guarantee and Indemnity
 
(e)
          
to exercise any right of set-off against any Obligor; and/or
 
(f)
           
to claim or prove as a creditor of any Obligor in competition with any Finance Party.
 
If a Guarantor receives any benefit, payment or distribution in relation to such rights it shall hold that benefit, payment or distribution to the extent necessary to enable all amounts which may be or become payable to the Finance Parties by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents to be repaid in full on trust for the Finance Parties and shall promptly pay or transfer the same to the Agent or as the Agent may direct for application in accordance with Clause 29 ().
Payment mechanics
 
18.8
       
Release of Guarantors' right of contribution
 
If any Guarantor (a ) ceases to be a Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents for the purpose of any sale or other disposal of that Retiring Guarantor then on the date such Retiring Guarantor ceases to be a Guarantor:
Retiring Guarantor
 
(a)
          
that Retiring Guarantor is released by each other Guarantor from any liability (whether past, present or future and whether actual or contingent) to make a contribution to any other Guarantor arising by reason of the performance by any other Guarantor of its obligations under the Finance Documents; and
 
(b)
          
each other Guarantor waives any rights it may have by reason of the performance of its obligations under the Finance Documents to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Finance Parties under any Finance Document or of any other security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, any Finance Document where such rights or security are granted by or in relation to the assets of the Retiring Guarantor.
 
18.9
       
Additional security
 
This guarantee is in addition to and is not in any way prejudiced by any other guarantee or security now or subsequently held by any Finance Party.
 
19.

On the first day of each Interest Period (or as soon as possible thereafter) the Agent shall calculate, as a percentage rate, a rate (the ) for each Lender, in accordance with the paragraphs set out below.  The Mandatory Cost will be calculated by the Agent as a weighted average of the Lenders' Additional Cost Rates (weighted in proportion to the percentage participation of each Lender in the relevant Loan) and will be expressed as a percentage rate per annum.
Additional Cost Rate

The Additional Cost Rate for any Lender lending from a Facility Office in a Participating Member State will be the percentage notified by that Lender to the Agent.  This percentage will be certified by that Lender in its notice to the Agent to be its reasonable determination of the cost (expressed as a percentage of that Lender's participation in all Loans made from that Facility Office) of complying with the minimum reserve requirements of the European Central Bank in respect of loans made from that Facility Office.

A

is the percentage rate of interest (excluding the Applicable Margin and the Mandatory Cost and, if the Loan is an Unpaid Sum, the additional rate of interest specified in paragraph (a) of Clause 9.4 ()) payable for the relevant Interest Period on the Loan.
Default interest
 
C
