On October 7, 2011, Best Buy Co., Inc. (the registrant) entered into a $1.0 billion 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (the 364-Day Facility Agreement) and a $1.5 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (the Five-Year Facility Agreement) (collectively the Agreements) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JPMorgan), as administrative agent, and a syndicate of banks (collectively, the Lenders). The Agreements will replace the $2.3 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, as amended (the Credit Facility), with a syndicate of banks, including JPMorgan acting as administrative agent. The Credit Facility was originally scheduled to expire in September 2012.
Some of the Lenders and/or their affiliates have other business relationships with the registrant involving the provision of financial and banking-related services, including cash management, loans, foreign exchange contracts, letters of credit and bank guarantee facilities, investment banking and trust services. The Agreements permit borrowings up to $2.5 billion (which may be increased to up to $3.0 billion at the registrant's option under certain circumstances) and a $300 million letter of credit sublimit. The 364-Day Facility Agreement and Five-Year Facility Agreement terminate in October 2012 (subject to a one-year term-out option) and October 2016, respectively.
Interest rates under the Agreements are variable and are determined at the registrant's option as: (i) the sum of (a) the greatest of JPMorgan's prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, or the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 1% and (b) a margin (the ABR Margin) or (ii) the LIBOR plus a margin (the LIBOR Margin). In addition, a facility fee is assessed on the commitment amount. The ABR Margin, LIBOR Margin and the facility fee are based upon the registrant's current senior unsecured debt rating. Under the 364-Day Facility Agreement, the ABR Margin ranges from 0.0% to 0.525%, the LIBOR Margin ranges from 0.925% to 1.525%, and the facility fee ranges from 0.075% to 0.225%. Under the Five-Year Facility Agreement, the ABR Margin ranges from 0.0% to 0.475%, the LIBOR Margin ranges from 0.875% to 1.475%, and the facility fee ranges from 0.125% to 0.275%.
The Agreements are guaranteed by specified subsidiaries of the registrant and contain customary affirmative and negative covenants. Among other things, these covenants restrict the registrant's or its subsidiaries' ability to incur certain types or amounts of indebtedness, incur liens on certain assets, make material changes in corporate structure or the nature of its business, dispose of material assets, engage in a change in control transaction, make certain foreign investments, enter into certain restrictive agreements, or engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The Agreements also contain covenants that require the registrant to maintain a maximum quarterly cash flow leverage ratio and a minimum quarterly interest coverage ratio. The Agreements contain customary default provisions including, but not limited to, failure to pay interest or principal when due and failure to comply with covenants.
The foregoing description of the Agreements does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Agreements which are attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and Exhibit 4.2 and incorporated herein by reference.

A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts, in Dollars, necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
(d)    
Delay in Requests.
Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders right to demand such compensation,
provided
that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the ninemonth period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
(e)    
Competitive Loans.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, a Lender shall not be entitled to compensation pursuant to this Section in respect of any Competitive Loan if the Change in Law (other than any Change in Law referred to in the proviso of the definition of such term) that would otherwise entitle it to such compensation shall have been publicly announced prior to submission of the Competitive Bid pursuant to which such Loan was made.
SECTION 2.16.    
Break Funding Payments.
In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan or Fixed Rate Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period therefor (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Syndicated Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Syndicated Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice is permitted to be revocable under Section 2.11(b) and is revoked in accordance herewith), (d) the failure to borrow any Competitive Loan after accepting the Competitive Bid to make such Loan, or (e) the assignment as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19(b) of any Syndicated Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurocurrency Loan, the loss to any Lender attributable to any such event shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that such Lender would pay for a deposit equal to the principal amount of such Loan for the period from the date of such payment, conversion, failure or assignment to the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the duration of the Interest Period that would have resulted from such borrowing, conversion or
27
continuation) if the interest rate payable on such deposit were equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate (in the case of a Syndicated Eurocurrency Loan) or the LIBO Rate (in the case of a Competitive Eurocurrency Loan) for such Interest Period,
over
(ii) the amount of interest that such Lender would earn on such principal amount for such period if such Lender were to invest such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that would be bid by such Lender (or an affiliate of such Lender) for deposits denominated in Dollars from other banks in the eurocurrency market at the commencement of such period. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
SECTION 2.17.    
Taxes.
(a)
Payments Free of Taxes.
Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes);
provided
that if the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor shall be required by applicable law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes (including any Other Taxes) from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor shall make or cause to be made such deductions and (iii) the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor shall timely pay or cause to be paid the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(b)    
Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower.
Without limiting the provisions of paragraph (a) above, the Borrower and each Subsidiary Guarantor shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c)    
Indemnification by the Borrower.
The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 30 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes, and Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts paid or payable under this Section, but excluding Excluded Taxes under all circumstances) paid or payable by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties and interest arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes) were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability, prepared in good faith and delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall not be obligated to indemnify for any Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes) if a written demand therefor is not made by the Administrative Agent or a Lender, as the case may be, within 120 days from the first date the Administrative Agent or such Lender knows or reasonably should have known of the imposition of such Taxes.
(d)    
Evidence of Payments.
As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes) by the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e)    
Indemnification by the Lenders.
Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for any Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors have not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors to do so) that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this paragraph (e) shall be paid within 10 days after the Administrative Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount of Taxes so
28
paid or payable by the Administrative Agent. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error.
(f)    
Foreign Lender Tax Certifications.
(i) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, any applicable withholding Tax with respect to any payments under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without, or at a reduced rate of, withholding. Upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, any Lender shall update any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this paragraph (f). If any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall promptly (and in any event within 10 days after such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy) notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy and update the form or certification if it is legally eligible to do so.
(ii)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:
(A)    each Foreign Lender shall (x) furnish on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement either (1) two accurate and complete originally executed U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or successor form), (2) two accurate and complete originally executed U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or successor form), and/or (3) two accurate and complete originally executed U.S. Internal Service Form W-8IMY (together with the forms described in clauses (1) and (2), as required) certifying, in each case, to such Foreign Lenders legal entitlement to a complete exemption from U.S. Federal withholding tax with respect to all interest payments hereunder, and (y) provide a new Form W-8BEN (or successor form) or Form W-8ECI (or successor form) and/or Form W-8IMY (or successor form) upon the expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered form to reconfirm complete exemption from U.S. Federal withholding tax with respect to any interest payment hereunder to the extent (in case of this clause (y)) such Foreign Lender is legally able to do so;
provided
that any Foreign Lender that is relying on the so-called portfolio interest exemption and is not (x) a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (y) a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code and (z) a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code, shall also furnish a Non-Bank Certificate in the form of Exhibit C together with a Form W-8BEN. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.17(f)(ii)(A), a Foreign Lender that is an assignee shall not be required to deliver any documentation pursuant to this Section 2.17(f)(ii)(A) that such Foreign Lender is not legally able to deliver. For the avoidance of doubt, the legal inability of a Foreign Lender to provide any documentation pursuant to this Section 2.17(f)(ii)(A) shall not cause any Tax resulting from such inability to be an Excluded Tax in circumstances where such inability arises solely due to a Change in Law subsequent to the date the Foreign Lender becomes a party to this Agreement. Subject to Section 2.17(a), if any Foreign Lender fails to provide the certifications described in this paragraph, each such Foreign Lender acknowledges that the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold any Taxes imposed by the United States or any taxing authority thereof or therein, to the extent required by law.
(B)    If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Withholding Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent, such documentation prescribed by
29
applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent as may be necessary for the Withholding Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA and, as necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.17(f)(ii)(B), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(g)    
U.S. Lender Tax Certifications.
Any Lender that is a United States person, as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code and is not an exempt recipient within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6049-4(c), shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Service Form W-9, or any successor form that such person is entitled to provide, establishing that the Lender is not subject to U.S. Federal backup withholding Tax.
(h)    
Cooperation in Contesting Indemnified Taxes.
If the Borrower determines in good faith that a reasonable basis exists for contesting any Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes) for which additional amounts have been paid under this Section 2.17, the Administrative Agent or the relevant Lender, as the case may be, shall cooperate with the Borrower in challenging such Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes) at the Borrowers expense, if so requested by the Borrower in writing;
provided
that, in the sole discretion, exercised in good faith, of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, doing so would not materially prejudice the Administrative Agent or such Lender, and the Administrative Agent or such Lender would not be required to disclose any information it considers proprietary or make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
(i)    
Treatment of Certain Refunds.
If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes) as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor or with respect to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor under this Section with respect to the Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes) giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund);
provided
that the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, shall repay the amount paid over to the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to disclose any information it considers proprietary or make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any other Person.
SECTION 2.18.    
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs.
(a)
Payments by the Obligors.
Each Obligor shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest or fees, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise), or under any other Loan Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein), prior to 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agents Account, except as otherwise expressly provided in the relevant Loan Document and except payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03, which shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly
30
following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments under each Loan Document shall be made in Dollars.
(b)    
Application of Insufficient Payments.
If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.
(c)    
Pro Rata Treatment.
Except to the extent otherwise provided herein (for the avoidance of doubt, as this Agreement is in effect from time to time): (i) each payment of facility fees under Section 2.12(a) shall be made for account of the Lenders, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments under Section 2.09 shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments (or, in the case of any such payment of facility fees at a time when the Commitments shall have terminated or expired, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Revolving Credit Exposure); (ii) each Syndicated Borrowing shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders according to the amounts of their respective Commitments (in the case of the making of Syndicated Loans) or their respective Loans that are to be included in such Borrowing (in the case of conversions and continuations of Loans); (iii) each payment or prepayment of any Syndicated Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the repaid or prepaid Syndicated Borrowing; and (iv) if the Term-Out Option is exercised, the payment of the term-out fees under Section 2.12(c) shall be made for account of the Lenders pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments immediately prior to the Commitment Termination Date.
(d)    
Sharing of Payments by Lenders.
If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans (other than a Competitive Loan) resulting in such Lenders receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans (other than Competitive Loans) and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (A) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact and (B) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans (other than Competitive Loans) of other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amounts of principal of and accrued interest on their Loans (other than Competitive Loans),
provided
that:
(i)    if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and
(ii)    the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by any Obligor pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, as this Agreement is in effect from time to time) or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).
Each Obligor consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each Obligor rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of each Obligor in the amount of such participation.
(e)    
Payments by the Borrower; Presumptions by the Administrative Agent.
Unless the
31
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
(f)    
Certain Deductions by the Administrative Agent.
If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it hereunder to or for the account of the Administrative Agent, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lenders obligations in respect of such payment until all such unsatisfied obligations have been discharged or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender pursuant to this Agreement (including pursuant to Sections 2.07(b), 2.18(e) and 10.03(c)), in each case in such order as shall be determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
SECTION 2.19.    
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a)
Designation of a Different Lending Office.
If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or requires the Borrower to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign and delegate its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment and delegation (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment and delegation.
(b)    
Replacement of Lenders.
If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, (ii) the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, (iii)  any Lender has become a Defaulting Lender, or (iv) any Lender does not consent to any proposed amendment, supplement, modification, consent or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that requires the consent of such Lender or each of the Lenders or each of the Lenders affected thereby (so long as the consent of the Required Lenders has been obtained), then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.04), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents (other than any outstanding Competitive Loans held by it) to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment),
provided
that:
(A)    the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld;
(B)    the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 10.04;
(C)    such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans (other than Competitive Loans), accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts (except Competitive Loans) payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 2.16) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
32
(D)    in the case of any such assignment and delegation resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment and delegation will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and
(E)    such assignment does not conflict with applicable law.
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Each party hereto agrees that an assignment and delegation required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and that the Lender required to make such assignment and delegation need not be a party thereto.
SECTION 2.20.    
Defaulting Lenders
. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
(a)    facility fees shall continue to accrue on the amount of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(a) only to the extent of the Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender; and
(b)    the Commitment, the Revolving Credit Exposure and the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Competitive Loans of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders or any other requisite Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 10.02);
provided
that any amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or all Lenders affected thereby shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.02, require the consent of such Defaulting Lender in accordance with the terms hereof.
In the event that the Administrative Agent and the Borrower each agree that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Syndicated Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.
SECTION 2.21.    
Term-Out Option
. The Borrower may, by irrevocable written notice to the Administrative Agent given, not less than 30 days, but not more than 60 days, prior to the Commitment Termination Date, elect (such election, the 
Term-Out Option
) to extend the Maturity Date to a one-year anniversary of the Commitment Termination Date;
provided
that on the Commitment Termination Date (a) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom, (b) the representations and warranties set forth in Article IV and in the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct on and as of the Commitment Termination Date as if made on and as of such date (or, if any such representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of a specific date, as of such specific date) and (c) the Borrower shall pay the Term-Out Fee to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(c). Each notice by the Borrower under this Section shall be deemed to constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower as to the matters specified in clauses (a) and (b) above as of the Commitment Termination Date. For the avoidance of doubt all Commitments will terminate on the Commitment Termination Date, and no additional Borrowings will be permitted after the Commitment Termination Date. This Section shall not apply to Competitive Loans, which must be repaid on or prior to the Commitment Termination Date.
ARTICLE III
Guarantee
33
SECTION 3.01.    
The Guarantee.
The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby jointly and severally, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, guarantee to each Lender, each other holder of a Guaranteed Obligation (as hereinafter defined) and the Administrative Agent and their respective successors and assigns the prompt payment in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the principal of and interest on the Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrower and all fees, indemnification payments and other amounts whatsoever, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, now or hereafter from time to time owing to the Lenders or the Administrative Agent by the Borrower under this Agreement and by any Obligor under any of the other Loan Documents, in each case strictly in accordance with the terms thereof and including all interest, fees and expenses accrued or incurred subsequent to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings with respect to the Borrower, whether or not such interest, fees or expenses are allowed as a claim in such proceeding (such obligations being herein collectively called the 
Guaranteed Obligations
). The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby further jointly and severally agree that if the Borrower shall fail to pay in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Subsidiary Guarantors will promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal.
SECTION 3.02.    
Obligations Unconditional.
The obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under Section 3.01 are absolute and unconditional, joint and several, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein, or any substitution, release or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor, it being the intent of this Section that the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional, joint and several, under any and all circumstances. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that the occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not alter or impair the liability of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder, which shall remain absolute and unconditional as described above:
(i)    at any time or from time to time, without notice to the Subsidiary Guarantors, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or compliance shall be waived;
(ii)    any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein shall be done or omitted;
(iii)    the maturity of any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be accelerated, or any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be modified, supplemented or amended in any respect, or any right under this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein shall be waived or any other guarantee of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security therefor shall be released or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with; or
(iv)    any lien or security interest granted to, or in favor of, the Administrative Agent or any Lender or Lenders as security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall fail to be perfected.
The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby expressly waive diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all notices whatsoever. Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that its guarantee hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and hereby expressly waives any requirement that the Administrative Agent or any Lender exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against the Borrower under this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein, or against any other Person under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Guaranteed Obligations.
34
SECTION 3.03.    
Reinstatement.
The obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under this Article shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and the Subsidiary Guarantors jointly and severally agree that they will indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including fees of counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.
SECTION 3.04.    
Subrogation.
The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby jointly and severally agree that until the payment and satisfaction in full of all Guaranteed Obligations and the expiration and termination of the Commitments of the Lenders under this Agreement they shall not exercise any right or remedy arising by reason of any performance by them of their guarantee in Section 3.01, whether by subrogation or otherwise, against the Borrower or any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations.
SECTION 3.05.    
Remedies.
The Subsidiary Guarantors jointly and severally agree that, as between the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Lenders, the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in Article VIII (and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in Article VIII) for purposes of Section 3.01 notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or such obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against the Borrower and that, in the event of such declaration (or such obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), such obligations (whether or not due and payable by the Borrower) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Subsidiary Guarantors for purposes of Section 3.01.
SECTION 3.06.    
Instrument for the Payment of Money

SECTION 9.01.    
Administrative Agent.
Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the entity named as Administrative Agent in the heading of this Agreement and its successors to serve as Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and neither the Borrower nor any other Obligor shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of such provisions.
The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:
(a)    shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;
(b)    shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02);
provided
that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or be contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law; and
(c)    shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct (with such absence to be presumed unless otherwise determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and nonappealable judgment). The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice describing such Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender.
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (a) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (b) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (c) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document or the occurrence of any Default, (d) the sufficiency, validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (e) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article V or elsewhere
49
in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not have any liability arising from any confirmation of the Revolving Credit Exposure or the component amounts thereof.
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for an Obligor), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more subagents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such subagent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such subagent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such subagent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, or required if an Event of Default under clauses (a), (b), (h) or (i) of Article VIII has occurred and is continuing), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States of America, or an Affiliate of any such bank. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above
provided
that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (a) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (b) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this paragraph. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agents resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its subagents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any other Lender or any Arranger or any of their Related Parties and based on such
50
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any other Lender or any other Arranger or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
Except as otherwise provided in Section 10.02(b) with respect to this Agreement, the Administrative Agent may, with the prior consent of the Required Lenders (but not otherwise), consent to any modification, supplement or waiver under any of the Loan Documents.
SECTION 9.02.    
Bookrunners, Etc.

To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender,
provided

provided
that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any Commitments, Loans or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.

(z)  the Swingline Exposure attributable to Swingline Loans maturing after such Existing Commitment Termination Date exceeding the total Commitments that shall have been extended to a date after the latest expiration date of such Letters of Credit and the latest maturity date of such Competitive Loans and such Swingline Loans;
provided
that no Swingline Lender shall be required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans. The Borrower may request any Swingline Loans from one or more of the Swingline Lenders, subject only to the limitation that the outstanding Swingline Loans of any Swingline Lender shall at no time exceed its Swingline Commitment. The failure of any Swingline Lender to make any Swingline Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Swingline Lender of its obligations hereunder;
provided
that the Swingline Commitments of each Swingline Lender are several and no Swingline Lender shall be responsible for any other Swingline Lenders failure to make Swingline Loans as required.
(b)    
Notice of Swingline Loans by the Borrower.
To request a Swingline Loan, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (confirmed by facsimile), not later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the day of a proposed Swingline Loan. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day), amount of the requested Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender requested to make such Swingline Loan and the location and number
23
of the Borrowers account to which funds are to be disbursed, or, in the case of any Swingline Loan requested to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.06(f), the identity of the Issuing Lender that made such LC Disbursement. The Administrative Agent will promptly advise the applicable Swingline Lender of any such notice received from the Borrower. The applicable Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan available to the Borrower by means of a credit to a deposit account of the Borrower as designated by the Borrower (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.06(f), by remittance to the respective Issuing Lender) by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the requested date of such Swingline Loan.
(c)    
Participations by Lenders in Swingline Loans.
Each Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on any Business Day require the Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of its Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which Lenders will be required to participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each Lender, specifying in such notice such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay, upon receipt of notice as provided above in this paragraph, to the Administrative Agent, for account of the applicable Swingline Lender, such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Lender further acknowledges and agrees that, in making any Swingline Loan, each Swingline Lender shall be entitled to rely, and shall not incur any liability for relying, upon the representation and warranty of the Borrower deemed made pursuant to Section 5.02, unless, at least two Business Days prior to the time such Swingline Loan was made, the Required Lenders shall have notified such Swingline Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in writing that, as a result of one or more events or circumstances described in such notice, one or more of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.02 would not be satisfied if such Swingline Loan were then made (it being understood and agreed that, in the event any Swingline Lender shall have received any such notice, no Swingline Lender shall make any Swingline Loan until and unless it shall be satisfied that the events and circumstances described in such notice shall have been cured or otherwise shall have ceased to exist). Each Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply,
mutatis
mutandis
, to the payment obligations of the Lenders under this paragraph), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Lenders.
The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to the preceding paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the applicable Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by a Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or other party on behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by such Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; and any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to the preceding paragraph and to such Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear;
provided
that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to such Swingline Lender or to the Administrative Agent, as applicable, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.
SECTION 2.06.    
Letters of Credit.
(a)
General.
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, in addition to the Loans provided for in Section 2.01, the Borrower may request any Issuing Lender to issue, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period, Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars for its own account in such form as is acceptable to the Administrative Agent and such Issuing
24
Lender in its reasonable determination. Letters of Credit issued hereunder shall constitute utilization of the Commitments. From and after the Effective Date, each Existing Letter of Credit shall be deemed, for all purposes of this Agreement (including paragraphs (e) and (f) of this Section), to be a Letter of Credit issued for the account of the Borrower on the Effective Date.
(b)    
Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal or Extension; Auto-Renewal Letters of Credit.
(i)    To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit, other than an automatic renewal of an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit permitted pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 2.06(b)), the Borrower shall hand deliver or facsimile (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the recipient) to the relevant Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (d) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the relevant Issuing Lender, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Lenders standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, an Issuing Lender relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.
(ii)    Any Letter of Credit issuable under this Agreement may be issued, if the Borrower so requests and the relevant Issuing Lender so agrees, in the form of an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit;
provided
that any such Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit must permit such Issuing Lender to prevent any such renewal at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof of such Issuing Lenders option not to extend the Letter of Credit beyond the expiration date (a 
Non-Renewal Notice
).  Such Issuing Lender shall have the option to issue a Non-Renewal Notice during a specified period in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon by the Borrower, such Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent at the time such Letter of Credit is issued (the date of such notice shall be referred to herein as the 
Non-Renewal Notice Date
).  Once an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit has been issued, each Lender shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the relevant Issuing Lender to permit the renewal of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than one year after its date of issuance or renewal;
provided
that such Issuing Lender shall not permit any such renewal if such Issuing Lender has reasonably determined that it would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its renewed form under the terms of this Agreement (by reason of the provisions of paragraph (c) or (d) of this Section or otherwise).
(c)    
Limitations on Amounts.
A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the aggregate LC Exposure shall not exceed $300,000,000, (ii) the sum of the total Revolving Credit Exposures
plus
the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Competitive Loans shall not exceed the total Commitments and (iii) in the event the Commitment Termination Date shall have been extended as provided in Section 2.20, the sum of (x) the LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit expiring after any Existing Commitment Termination Date,
plus
(y) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Competitive Loans maturing after such Existing Commitment Termination Date
plus
(z) the Swingline Exposure attributable to Swingline Loans maturing after such Existing Commitment Termination Date shall not exceed the total Commitments that shall have been extended to a date after the latest expiration date of such Letters of Credit and the latest maturity date of such Competitive Loans and such Swingline Loans.
(d)    
Expiration Date.
Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business
25
on the earlier of (i) the date twelve months after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, twelve months after the thencurrent expiration date of such Letter of Credit) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Commitment Termination Date.
(e)    
Participations.
By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) by any Issuing Lender, and without any further action on the part of such Issuing Lender or the Lenders, such Issuing Lender hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Lender, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments. Each Lender further acknowledges and agrees that each Issuing Lender shall be entitled to rely, and shall not incur any liability for relying, upon the representation and warranty of the Borrower deemed made pursuant to Section 5.02, unless, at least two Business Days prior to the time of issuance, or the time of any amendment, renewal or extension subject to Section 5.02, of any Letter of Credit by such Issuing Lender, the Required Lenders shall have notified the applicable Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in writing that, as a result of one or more events or circumstances described in such notice, one or more of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.02 would not be satisfied if such Letter of Credit were then issued or so amended, renewed or extended (it being understood and agreed that, in the event any Issuing Lender shall have received any such notice, no Issuing Lender shall issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit until and unless it shall be satisfied that the events and circumstances described in such notice shall have been cured or otherwise shall have ceased to exist).
In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for account of the relevant Issuing Lender, such Lenders Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by an Issuing Lender promptly upon the request of such Issuing Lender at any time from the time of such LC Disbursement until such LC Disbursement is reimbursed by the Borrower or at any time after any reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each such payment shall be made in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Syndicated Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply,
mutatis
mutandis
, to the payment obligations of the Lenders under this paragraph), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the relevant Issuing Lender the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the relevant Issuing Lender or, to the extent that the Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Lender, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Lender as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Lender for any LC Disbursement shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
(f)    
Reimbursement.
If an Issuing Lender shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such Issuing Lender in respect of such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice of such LC Disbursement, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time;
provided
that if such LC Disbursement is not less than (x) $2,000,000 in the case of a Syndicated ABR Borrowing and (y) $1,000,000 in the case of a Swingline Loan, the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.05 that such payment be financed with a Syndicated ABR Borrowing or a Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrowers obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Syndicated ABR Borrowing or Swingline Loan.
26
If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lenders Applicable Percentage thereof.
(g)    
Obligations Absolute.
The Borrowers obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (f) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by an Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply strictly with the terms of such Letter of Credit, (iv) the failure to perfect any lien or security interest granted to, or in favor of, the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders as security for any reimbursement obligations in respect of any LC Disbursement or (v) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrowers obligations hereunder.
None of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or the Issuing Lenders, or any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit by any Issuing Lender or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the relevant Issuing Lender;
provided
that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse an Issuing Lender from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Lenders failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Lender (with such absence to be presumed unless otherwise determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and nonappealable judgment), such Issuing Lender shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination, and that:
(i)    an Issuing Lender may accept documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and may make payment upon presentation of documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit;
(ii)    an Issuing Lender shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to decline to accept such documents and to make such payment if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and
(iii)    this sentence shall establish the standard of care to be exercised by an Issuing Lender when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof (and the parties hereto hereby waive, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any standard of care inconsistent with the foregoing).
(h)    
Disbursement Procedures.
The Issuing Lender for any Letter of Credit shall, within a reasonable time following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under such Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Lender shall promptly after such examination notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by facsimile) of such demand for payment
27
and whether such Issuing Lender has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder;
provided
that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Lender and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
(i)    
Interim Interest.
If the Issuing Lender for any Letter of Credit shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to, but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to Syndicated ABR Loans;
provided
that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section, then Section 2.13(d) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of such Issuing Lender, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Lender shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment, and shall be payable on demand or, if no demand has been made, on the date on which the Borrower reimburses the applicable LC Disbursement in full.
(j)    
Additional Issuing Lenders; Termination of Issuing Lenders.
An Issuing Lender may be added, or an existing Issuing Lender may be terminated, under this Agreement at any time by written agreement between the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the relevant Issuing Lender. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such addition or termination. At the time any such termination shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the Issuing Lender being terminated pursuant to Section 2.12(b). From and after the effective date of any such addition, the new Issuing Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Lender under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter. After the termination of an Issuing Lender hereunder, the terminated Issuing Lender shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Lender under this Agreement with respect to any outstanding Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such termination, but shall not be required to issue any new Letters of Credit or to renew or extend any such outstanding Letters of Credit.
(k)    
Issuing Lender Reports to the Administrative Agent.
Unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender shall, in addition to its notification obligations set forth elsewhere in this Section, report in writing to the Administrative Agent (i) periodic activity (for such period or recurrent periods as shall be requested by the Administrative Agent) in respect of Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender, including all issuances, extensions, amendments and renewals, all expirations and cancellations and all disbursements and reimbursements, (ii) reasonably prior to the time that such Issuing Lender issues, amends, renews or extends any Letter of Credit, the date of such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, and the stated amount of the Letters of Credit issued, amended, renewed or extended by it and outstanding after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (and whether the amounts thereof shall have changed), (iii) on each Business Day on which such Issuing Lender makes any LC Disbursement, the date and amount of such LC Disbursement, (iv) on any Business Day on which the Borrower fails to reimburse an LC Disbursement required to be reimbursed to such Issuing Lender on such day, the date of such failure and the amount of such LC Disbursement and (v) on any other Business Day, such other information as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request as to the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender.
(l)    
Cash Collateralization.
If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated pursuant to Article VIII, Lenders with LC Exposure representing more than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall immediately deposit into an account established and maintained on the books and records of the Administrative Agent, which account may be a securities account (within the meaning of Section 8501 of the UCC), in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in immediately available funds in Dollars equal to 103% of the LC Exposure as of such date
plus
any accrued and unpaid interest thereon;
provided
that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral
28
shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VIII. The Borrower also shall deposit cash collateral in accordance with this paragraph as and to the extent required by Section 2.21. Each such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the LC Exposure and other obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement, and for this purpose the Borrower hereby grants a security interest to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders in such collateral account and in any financial assets (as defined in the UCC) or other property held therein.
The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. All amounts on deposit pursuant to this paragraph (l) shall be invested by the Administrative Agent in interest bearing instruments or accounts, with the selection of which instruments or accounts to be determined by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion;
provided
that the Administrative Agent shall consult with the Borrower as to the selection of such instruments or accounts;
provided
further
that such investments shall be at the risk and expense of the Borrower. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the relevant Issuing Lender for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but (i) subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing 100% of the total LC Exposure and (ii) in the case of any such application at a time when any Lender is a Defaulting Lender (but only if, after giving effect thereto, the remaining cash collateral shall be less than the aggregate LC Exposure of all the Defaulting Lenders), the consent of each Issuing Lender)), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, the amount (including any interest and profits earned thereon as aforesaid) standing to the credit of such account (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder pursuant to Section 2.21, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower, as promptly as practicable, to the extent that, after giving effect to such return, no Issuing Lender shall have any exposure in respect of any outstanding Letter of Credit that is not fully covered by the Commitments of the Non-Defaulting Lenders and/or the remaining cash collateral and no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.
SECTION 2.07.    
Funding of Borrowings.
(a)
Funding by Lenders
. Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 2:00 p.m., New York City time (or, in the case of any Syndicated ABR Loan, 4:00 p.m. New York City time), to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders;
provided
that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.05. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower designated by the Borrower in the applicable borrowing request;
provided
that Syndicated ABR Borrowings made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.06(f) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the relevant Issuing Lender.
(b)    
Presumption by the Administrative Agent.
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed time of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal
29
Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Syndicated ABR Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
SECTION 2.08.    
Interest Elections.
(a)
Elections by the Borrower for Syndicated Borrowings.
The Loans comprising each Syndicated Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request or as otherwise provided in Section 2.03(d) and, in the case of a Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall have the Interest Period specified in such Borrowing Request or as otherwise provided in Section 2.03(d). Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a Borrowing of a different Type or to continue such Borrowing as a Borrowing of the same Type and, in the case of a Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing, may elect the Interest Period therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Competitive Borrowings or Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.
(b)    
Notice of Elections.
To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Syndicated Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or facsimile to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.
(c)    
Content of Interest Election Requests.
Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i)    the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
(ii)    the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii)    whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and
(iv)    if the resulting Borrowing is a Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period therefor after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest Period and permitted under Section 2.02(d).
(d)    
Notice by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders.
Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lenders portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e)    
Failure to Elect; Events of Default.
If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely and
30
complete Interest Election Request with respect to a Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period therefor, then, unless such Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one months duration.
Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower (
provided
that no such notice shall be required in the case of any Event of Default under clause (h) or (i) of Article VII with respect to the Borrower), then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (A) no outstanding Syndicated Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing and (B) unless repaid, each Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be converted to a Syndicated ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period therefor.
SECTION 2.09.    
Termination, Reduction and Increase of the Commitments.
(a)
Scheduled Termination.
Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Commitment Termination Date.
(b)    
Voluntary Termination or Reduction.
The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments;
provided
that (i) each partial reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is $5,000,000 or a larger multiple thereof and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the sum of the total Revolving Credit Exposures
plus
the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Competitive Loans would exceed the total Commitments.
(c)    
Notice of Voluntary Termination or Reduction.

Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable;
provided
that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.
(d)    
Effect of Termination or Reduction.
Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.
(e)    
Increase of Commitments.
(i)    
Requests for Increase.
The Borrower may, at any time following the Effective Date, effect an increase in the Commitments hereunder (each such increase being a 
Commitment Increase
) by having one or more Additional Commitment Lenders provide new or additional Commitments hereunder, by notice to the Administrative Agent specifying the amount of the relevant Commitment Increase, the identity of the Additional Commitment Lender(s) and the date on which such increase is to be effective (the 
Commitment Increase Date
), which shall be a Business Day at least three Business Days after delivery of such notice and 30 days prior to the Commitment Termination Date (or, if at such time, there shall exist different Commitment Termination Dates for the Lenders hereunder, the latest applicable Commitment Termination Date);
provided
that:
(A)    the minimum amount of each Commitment Increase shall be $25,000,000;
(B)    immediately after giving effect to any Commitment Increase, the aggregate Commitments hereunder shall not exceed $2,000,000,000;
31
(C)    at the time of any such Commitment Increase, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom; and

Each notice by the Borrower under this paragraph shall be deemed to constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower as to the matters specified in clauses (B), (C) and (D) above as of the relevant Commitment Increase Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Lender shall have any obligation hereunder to become an Additional Commitment Lender and any election to do so shall be in the sole discretion of each Lender.
(ii)    
Effectiveness of Increase.
Each Commitment Increase (and the new or additional Commitment of each Additional Commitment Lender resulting therefrom) shall become effective as of the relevant Commitment Increase Date upon receipt by the Administrative Agent, on or prior to 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Commitment Increase Date, of:
(A)    a certificate executed by a Financial Officer of the Borrower stating that the conditions with respect to such Commitment Increase under this paragraph (e) have been satisfied;
(B)    an agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, pursuant to which each such Additional Commitment Lender shall, effective as of such Commitment Increase Date, provide a new or additional Commitment hereunder in the amount specified therein and (if not then an existing Lender) become a Lender hereunder, in each case duly executed by each such Additional Commitment Lender and the Borrower and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent; and
(C)    such evidence of authority of the Borrower to effect such Commitment Increase as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request.
Upon the Administrative Agents receipt of a fully executed agreement from each Additional Commitment Lender referred to in clause (B) above, together with the certificates and/or other documents referred to in clauses (A) and (C) above, the Administrative Agent shall record the information contained in each such agreement in the Register and give prompt notice of the relevant Commitment Increase to the Borrower and the Lenders (including each Additional Commitment Lender).
On each Commitment Increase Date the Borrower shall (a) request funding of Syndicated Loans by each Additional Commitment Lender for whom a Commitment Increase is then effective in such amounts and with such Interest Periods as may be required (after giving effect to the partial payment provided for in clause (ii) below) to cause each outstanding Syndicated Borrowing to be held by all Lenders (including such Additional Commitment Lenders) ratably in proportion to the Commitments and (ii) direct the Administrative Agent to apply the proceeds of such funding to the partial prepayment of Syndicated Borrowings outstanding to Lenders immediately before giving effect to such Commitment Increase, ratably in proportion to the amount outstanding owing to them before giving effect to such Commitment Increase. Each Lender will have the right to request compensation under Section 2.16 in respect of such partial prepayment, to the extent therein provided. Upon each Commitment Increase, the participation interests of the Lenders in the then outstanding Letters of Credit shall automatically be adjusted to reflect, and each Lender (including each Additional Commitment Lender) shall have a participation in each such Letter of Credit equal to, the Lenders respective Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under each such Letter of Credit, after giving effect to such increase.

If the Borrower fails to make a timely selection of the Borrowing or Borrowings to be repaid or prepaid, such payment shall be applied, first, to pay any outstanding ABR Borrowings and, second, to other Borrowings in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the Borrowing with the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid first). Each payment of a Syndicated Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in such Borrowing.

The entries made in the records maintained pursuant to paragraph (c) or (d) of this Section shall be
prima
facie
evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein;
provided
that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such records or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans or pay any other amounts hereunder in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(f)    
Promissory Notes.
Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender and its registered assigns and in customary form reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

provided
that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.09, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.09. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Syndicated Borrowing or Competitive Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the relevant Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of a Borrowing of the same Class and Type as provided in Section 2.02.

plus
the Applicable Rate.

The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
SECTION 2.14.    
Alternate Rate of Interest.
If prior to the commencement of the Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Borrowing:
(a)    the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive
35
absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate (in the case of a Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing) or the LIBO Rate (in the case of a Competitive Eurocurrency Borrowing) for such Interest Period; or
(b)    the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders (or, in the case of a Competitive Eurocurrency Borrowing, any Lender that is required to make a Loan included in such Borrowing) that the Adjusted LIBO Rate (in the case of a Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing) or the LIBO Rate (in the case of a Competitive Eurocurrency Borrowing) for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their respective Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or facsimile as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Syndicated Borrowing to, or the continuation of any Syndicated Borrowing as, a Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be ineffective and such Syndicated Borrowing (unless prepaid) shall be continued as, or converted to, a Syndicated ABR Borrowing and (ii) any Borrowing Request for a Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be treated as a request for a Syndicated ABR Borrowing.
SECTION 2.15.    
Increased Costs.
(a)

If any Change in Law shall:
(i)    impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or any Issuing Lender;
(ii)    subject any Lender or any Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Tax (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Other Taxes, (C) Taxes described in clauses (a) and (c) through (e) of the definition of Excluded Taxes, (D) Connection Income Taxes and (E) Taxes imposed on gross or net income, profits or revenue, including value-added and similar Taxes) of any kind whatsoever with respect to its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or
(iii)    impose on any Lender or any Issuing Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement, Eurocurrency Loans or Fixed Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan or Fixed Rate Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or such Issuing Lender of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, such Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in Dollars, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, such Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b)    
Capital Requirements.
If any Lender or any Issuing Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or such Issuing Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Issuing Lender or such Lenders or such Issuing Lenders holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or such Issuing Lenders capital or on the capital of such Lenders or such Issuing Lenders holding company, if any, as a
36
consequence of this Agreement, the Commitment of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Lender or such Lenders or such Issuing Lenders holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or such Issuing Lenders policies and the policies of such Lenders or such Issuing Lenders holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, in Dollars, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Lender or such Lenders or such Issuing Lenders holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c)    
Certificates for Reimbursement.
A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Lender setting forth the amount or amounts, in Dollars, necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
(d)    
Delay in Requests.
Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders or such Issuing Lenders right to demand such compensation,
provided
that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders or such Issuing Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the ninemonth period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
(e)    
Competitive Loans.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, a Lender shall not be entitled to compensation pursuant to this Section in respect of any Competitive Loan if the Change in Law (other than any Change in Law referred to in the proviso of the definition of such term) that would otherwise entitle it to such compensation shall have been publicly announced prior to submission of the Competitive Bid pursuant to which such Loan was made.
SECTION 2.16.    
Break Funding Payments.
In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan or Fixed Rate Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period therefor (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Syndicated Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Syndicated Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice is permitted to be revocable under Section 2.11(b) and is revoked in accordance herewith), (d) the failure to borrow any Competitive Loan after accepting the Competitive Bid to make such Loan, or (e) the assignment as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19(b) of any Syndicated Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurocurrency Loan, the loss to any Lender attributable to any such event shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that such Lender would pay for a deposit equal to the principal amount of such Loan for the period from the date of such payment, conversion, failure or assignment to the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the duration of the Interest Period that would have resulted from such borrowing, conversion or continuation) if the interest rate payable on such deposit were equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate (in the case of a Syndicated Eurocurrency Loan) or the LIBO Rate (in the case of a Competitive Eurocurrency Loan) for such Interest Period,
over
(ii) the amount of interest that such Lender would earn on such principal amount for such period if such Lender were to invest such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that would be bid by such Lender (or an affiliate of such Lender) for deposits denominated in Dollars from other banks in the eurocurrency market at the commencement of such period. A certificate of any Lender setting
37
forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
SECTION 2.17.    
Taxes.
(a)
Payments Free of Taxes.
Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes);
provided
that if the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor shall be required by applicable law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes (including any Other Taxes) from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor shall make or cause to be made such deductions and (iii) the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor shall timely pay or cause to be paid the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(b)    
Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower.
Without limiting the provisions of paragraph (a) above, the Borrower and each Subsidiary Guarantor shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c)    
Indemnification by the Borrower.
The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Lender, within 30 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes, and Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts paid or payable under this Section, but excluding Excluded Taxes under all circumstances) paid or payable by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties and interest arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes) were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability, prepared in good faith and delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or an Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall not be obligated to indemnify for any Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes) if a written demand therefor is not made by the Administrative Agent, a Lender or an Issuing Lender, as the case may be, within 120 days from the first date the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Lender knows or reasonably should have known of the imposition of such Taxes.
(d)    
Evidence of Payments.
As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes) by the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e)    
Indemnification by the Lenders.
Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for any Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors have not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors to do so) that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this paragraph (e) shall be paid within 10 days after the Administrative Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount of Taxes so paid or payable by the Administrative Agent. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error.
(f)    
Foreign Lender Tax Certifications.
(i) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, any applicable withholding Tax with respect to any payments under any
38
Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without, or at a reduced rate of, withholding. Upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, any Lender shall update any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this paragraph (f). If any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall promptly (and in any event within 10 days after such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy) notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy and update the form or certification if it is legally eligible to do so.
(ii)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:
(A)    each Foreign Lender shall (x) furnish on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement either (1) two accurate and complete originally executed U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or successor form), (2) two accurate and complete originally executed U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or successor form), and/or (3) two accurate and complete originally executed U.S. Internal Service Form W-8IMY (together with the forms described in clauses (1) and (2), as required) certifying, in each case, to such Foreign Lenders legal entitlement to a complete exemption from U.S. Federal withholding tax with respect to all interest payments hereunder, and (y) provide a new Form W-8BEN (or successor form) or Form W-8ECI (or successor form) and/or Form W-8IMY (or successor form) upon the expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered form to reconfirm complete exemption from U.S. Federal withholding tax with respect to any interest payment hereunder to the extent (in case of this clause (y)) such Foreign Lender is legally able to do so;
provided
that any Foreign Lender that is relying on the so-called portfolio interest exemption and is not (x) a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (y) a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code and (z) a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code, shall also furnish a Non-Bank Certificate in the form of Exhibit C together with a Form W-8BEN. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.17(f)(ii)(A), a Foreign Lender that is an assignee shall not be required to deliver any documentation pursuant to this Section 2.17(f)(ii)(A) that such Foreign Lender is not legally able to deliver. For the avoidance of doubt, the legal inability of a Foreign Lender to provide any documentation pursuant to this Section 2.17(f)(ii)(A) shall not cause any Tax resulting from such inability to be an Excluded Tax in circumstances where such inability arises solely due to a Change in Law subsequent to the date the Foreign Lender becomes a party to this Agreement. Subject to Section 2.17(a), if any Foreign Lender fails to provide the certifications described in this paragraph, each such Foreign Lender acknowledges that the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold any Taxes imposed by the United States or any taxing authority thereof or therein, to the extent required by law.
(B)    If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Withholding Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent as may be necessary for the Withholding Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA and, as necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such
39
payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.17(f)(ii)(B), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(g)    
U.S. Lender Tax Certifications.
Any Lender that is a United States person, as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code and is not an exempt recipient within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6049-4(c), shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Service Form W-9, or any successor form that such person is entitled to provide, establishing that the Lender is not subject to U.S. Federal backup withholding Tax.
(h)    
Cooperation in Contesting Indemnified Taxes.
If the Borrower determines in good faith that a reasonable basis exists for contesting any Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes) for which additional amounts have been paid under this Section 2.17, the Administrative Agent or the relevant Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, shall cooperate with the Borrower in challenging such Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes) at the Borrowers expense, if so requested by the Borrower in writing;
provided
that, in the sole discretion, exercised in good faith, of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, doing so would not materially prejudice the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Lender, and the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Lender would not be required to disclose any information it considers proprietary or make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
(i)    
Treatment of Certain Refunds.
If the Administrative Agent, a Lender or an Issuing Lender determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes) as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor or with respect to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor under this Section with respect to the Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes) giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund);
provided
that the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Lender, shall repay the amount paid over to the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Lender in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or an Issuing Lender to disclose any information it considers proprietary or make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any other Person.
SECTION 2.18.    
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs.
(a)
Payments by the Obligors.
Each Obligor shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise), or under any other Loan Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein), prior to 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agents Account, except as otherwise expressly provided in the relevant Loan Document and except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Lender or a Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03, which shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next
40
succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments under each Loan Document shall be made in Dollars.
(b)    
Application of Insufficient Payments.
If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
(c)    
Pro Rata Treatment.
Except to the extent otherwise provided herein (for the avoidance of doubt, as this Agreement is in effect from time to time), including Sections 2.20(d) and 2.21: (i) each payment of facility fees under Section 2.12(a) and letter of credit fees under Section 2.12(b) shall be made for account of the Lenders, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments under Section 2.09 shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments (or, in the case of any such payment of facility fees at a time when the Commitments shall have terminated or expired, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Revolving Credit Exposure); (ii) each Syndicated Borrowing shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders according to the amounts of their respective Commitments (in the case of the making of Syndicated Loans) or their respective Loans that are to be included in such Borrowing (in the case of conversions and continuations of Loans); and (iii) each payment or prepayment of any Syndicated Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the repaid or prepaid Syndicated Borrowing.
(d)    
Sharing of Payments by Lenders.
If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans (other than a Competitive Loan) or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lenders receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans (other than Competitive Loans) and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (A) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact and (B) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans (other than Competitive Loans) and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amounts of principal of and accrued interest on their Loans (other than Competitive Loans) and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans,
provided
that:
(i)    if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and
(ii)    the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by any Obligor pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, as this Agreement is in effect from time to time) or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).
Each Obligor consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each Obligor rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of each Obligor in the amount of such participation.
(e)    
Payments by the Borrower; Presumptions by the Administrative Agent.
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment
41
is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or an Issuing Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
(f)    
Certain Deductions by the Administrative Agent.
If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it hereunder to or for the account of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Swingline Lender, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lenders obligations in respect of such payment until all such unsatisfied obligations have been discharged or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender pursuant to this Agreement (including pursuant to Sections 2.05(c), 2.06(e), 2.06(f), 2.07(b), 2.18(e) and 10.03(c)), in each case in such order as shall be determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
SECTION 2.19.    
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a)
Designation of a Different Lending Office.
If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or requires the Borrower to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign and delegate its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment and delegation (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment and delegation.
(b)    
Replacement of Lenders.
If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, (ii) the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, (iii) any Lender has become a Defaulting Lender, (iv) any Lender has become a Non-Extending Lender or (v) any Lender does not consent to any proposed amendment, supplement, modification, consent or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that requires the consent of such Lender or each of the Lenders or each of the Lenders affected thereby (so long as the consent of the Required Lenders has been obtained), then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.04), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents (other than any outstanding Competitive Loans held by it) to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment),
provided
that:
(A)    the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Commitment or any Lenders obligations in respect of LC Exposure or Swingline Exposure is being assigned, each Issuing Lender and each Swingline Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld;
(B)    the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 10.04;
(C)    such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding
42
principal of its Loans (other than Competitive Loans) and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans that have been funded by such Lender, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts (except Competitive Loans) payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 2.16) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
(D)    in the case of any such assignment and delegation resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment and delegation will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter;
(E)    in the case of any such assignment and delegation resulting from any Lender becoming a Non-Extending Lender, the assignee shall be an Additional Commitment Lender and, upon the effectiveness of any such assignment and delegation, such assignee shall be deemed to have consented to the extension of the Commitment Termination Date requested in the relevant Extension Request (and, if such assignment and delegation shall become effective after the relevant Extension Effective Date, the Commitment Termination Date with respect to such Additional Commitment Lender (insofar as relating to the interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents so assigned and delegated) shall automatically extend to the date specified in the relevant Extension Request); and
(F)    such assignment does not conflict with applicable law.
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Each party hereto agrees that an assignment and delegation required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and that the Lender required to make such assignment and delegation need not be a party thereto.
SECTION 2.20.    
Extension of Commitment Termination Date.
(a) The Borrower may, by notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders) not more than 90 days and not less than 30 days prior to each anniversary of the date hereof (or if such anniversary date is not a Business Day, the Business Day next succeeding such anniversary), request (each, an 
Extension Request
) that the Lenders extend the Commitment Termination Date then in effect (or, if at such time there shall exist different Commitment Termination Dates for the Lenders hereunder, the latest applicable Commitment Termination Date then in effect) (the 
Existing Commitment Termination Date
) for an additional one year (the date on which any such extension shall become effective is referred to herein as an 
Extension Effective Date
);
provided
that only two Extension Requests may be requested hereunder. Each Lender, acting in its sole discretion, shall, by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent given not later than the 20th day (or such later day as shall be acceptable to the Borrower) following the date of the Borrowers notice, advise the Borrower and the Administrative Agent whether or not such Lender agrees to such extension;
provided
that any Lender that does not so advise the Borrower shall be deemed to have rejected such Extension Request (any such Lender which shall have rejected or is deemed to have rejected such extension being a 
Non-Extending Lender
). The election of any Lender to agree to such extension shall not obligate any other Lender to so agree. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Lender shall have any obligation hereunder to extend its Commitment.
(b)    The Borrower shall have the right, at any time on or prior to, or at any time following, the relevant Extension Effective Date, unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, to replace any Non-Extending Lender with one or more Additional Commitment Lenders in accordance with Section 2.19(b). If requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, each such Additional Commitment Lender shall enter into an agreement with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, in form and substance satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, pursuant to which such Additional Commitment Lender shall reconfirm its Commitment hereunder so assumed from the relevant Non-Extending Lender and,
43
in the case of any such replacement becoming effective after the relevant Extension Effective Date, reconfirm the extension of the Commitment Termination Date applicable thereto as contemplated by clause (E) of Section 2.19(b).
(c)    If (and only if) the total of the Commitments of the Lenders that have agreed in connection with any Extension Request to extend the Existing Commitment Termination Date and (if applicable) the Commitments of the Additional Commitment Lender(s) that shall have replaced any Non-Extending Lender as contemplated by paragraph (b) above shall, in the aggregate, be at least 50% of the aggregate amount of the Commitments in effect immediately prior to the Extension Effective Date, then, effective as of the Extension Effective Date, the Commitment Termination Date, but only with respect to each Lender that has agreed to so extend its Commitment and (if applicable) each Additional Commitment Lender that has replaced a Non-Extending Lender (and to Commitments and Loans of each such Lender and Additional Commitment Lender), shall be extended to the date that is one year after the then Existing Commitment Termination Date (or, if such date is not a Business Day, the immediately preceding Business Day);
provided
that the extension of the Existing Commitment Termination Date shall not be effective with respect to any Lender unless as of the Extension Effective Date: (i) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing; (ii) the representations and warranties of the Obligors set forth in Article IV and in the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct on and as of the Existing Commitment Termination Date as if made on and as of such date (or, if any such representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of a specific date, as of such specific date); (iii) the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate of a Financial Officer of the Borrower stating that the conditions with respect to such extension have been satisfied; and (iv) the Administrative Agent shall have received such evidence and other related documents as it may reasonably request with respect to the authorization of the Borrower of such extension and its obligations hereunder as so extended. Upon the effectiveness of such extension, the Administrative Agent shall record the relevant information in the Register and give prompt notice of such extension to the Borrower and the Lenders.
(d)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) with respect to any Non-Extending Lender, the Commitment Termination Date for such Lender shall remain unchanged (and the Commitment of such Lender shall terminate, the Loans made by such Lender to the Borrower hereunder shall mature and be payable by the Borrower, and all other amounts owing to such Non-Extending Lender hereunder shall be payable, on such date), and on such date the Borrower shall also make such other prepayments of Loans as shall be required in order that, after giving effect to the termination of the Commitments of, and all payments to, the Non-Extended Lenders pursuant to this sentence, the sum of (x) the outstanding aggregate principal amount of all Loans and (y) the LC Exposure will not exceed the Commitments and (ii)  the Availability Period and the Commitment Termination Date (without taking into consideration any extension pursuant to this Section 2.20), as such terms are used in reference to any Issuing Lender or any Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender or any Swingline Lender or any Swingline Loan made by such Swingline Lender, may not be extended without the prior written consent of such Issuing Lender and such Swingline Lender, as applicable (it being understood and agreed that, in the event any Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender shall not have consented to any such extension, (i) such Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender, as applicable, shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Lender or a Swingline Lender, as applicable, hereunder through the Existing Commitment Termination Date (or the Availability Period determined on the basis thereof, as applicable), and thereafter shall have no obligation to make any Swingline Loans or to issue, amend, extend or renew any Letter of Credit (but shall, in each case, continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.05, 2.06, 2.13, 2.15, 10.03 and 10.09, as applicable as to Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans issued or made prior to such time), and (ii) the Borrower shall cause the LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender and the Swingline Exposure attributable to Swingline Loans made by such Swingline Lender to be zero no later than the day on which such LC Exposure or Swingline Exposure, as applicable, would have been required to have been reduced to zero in accordance with the terms hereof without giving effect to any effectiveness of the extension of the applicable Existing Commitment Termination Date pursuant to this Section (and, in any event, no later than such Existing Commitment Termination Date)).
SECTION 2.21.    
Defaulting Lenders.
Notwithstanding any provision of this
44
Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
(a)    facility fees shall continue to accrue on the amount of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(a) only to the extent of the Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender (excluding any portion thereof constituting Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender that is subject to reallocation under clause (c)(i) below);
(b)    the Commitment, the Revolving Credit Exposure and the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Competitive Loans of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders or any other requisite Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 10.02);
provided
that any amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or all Lenders affected thereby shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.02, require the consent of such Defaulting Lender in accordance with the terms hereof;
(c)    if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
(i)    the Swingline Exposure (other than any portion thereof with respect to which such Defaulting Lender shall have funded its participation as contemplated by Section 2.05(c)) and LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender (other than any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements with respect to which such Defaulting Lender shall have funded its participation as contemplated by Sections 2.06(e) and 2.06(f)) shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only (x) to the extent that the sum of all Non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lenders Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure (in each case, excluding the portion thereof referred to above) does not exceed the sum of all Non-Defaulting Lenders Commitments and (y) so long as no Default or an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at such time;
(ii)    if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent (A) first, prepay the portion of such Defaulting Lenders Swingline Exposure that has not been reallocated as set forth in such clause and (B) second, cash collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Lenders the portion of such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure that has not been reallocated as set forth in such clause in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.06(l) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;
(iii)    if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay participation fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(b) with respect to such portion of such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure for so long as such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure is cash collateralized;
(iv)    if any portion of the LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.12(b) shall be adjusted to give effect to such reallocation;
(v)    if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lenders Swingline Exposure that is subject to reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above is neither reallocated nor reduced pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Swingline Lender or any other Lender hereunder, all facility fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such portion of its Swingline Exposure shall be payable to the Swingline Lenders (and allocated among them ratably based on the amount of such portion of the Swingline Exposure of such Defaulting Lender attributable to Swingline Loans made by each Swingline Lender) until
45
and to the extent that such Swingline Exposure is reallocated and/or reduced to zero; and
(vi)    if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure that is subject to reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Lender or any other Lender hereunder, all facility fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such portion of its LC Exposure, and all participation fees payable under Section 2.12(b) with respect to such portion of its LC Exposure, shall be payable to the Issuing Lenders (and allocated among them ratably based on the amount of such portion of the LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender attributable to Letters of Credit issued by each Issuing Lender) until and to the extent that such LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and
(d)    so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Swingline Lender shall be required to fund any Swingline Loan and no Issuing Lender shall be required to issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit, unless in each case it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lenders then outstanding Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure, as applicable, will be fully covered by the Commitments of the Non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral provided by the Borrower in accordance with clause (c) above, and participating interests in any such funded Swingline Loan or in any such issued, amended, renewed or extended Letter of Credit will be allocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with clause (c)(i) above (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
In the event that a Bankruptcy Event with respect to a Lender Parent of any Lender shall have occurred following the date hereof and for so long as such Bankruptcy Event shall continue, no Swingline Lender shall be required to fund any Swingline Loan, and no Issuing Lender shall be required to issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit, unless such Swingline Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, shall have entered into arrangements (including arrangements referred to in clause (c) above, treating such Lender as if it were a Defaulting Lender (with each Lender hereby agreeing to such arrangements)) with the Borrower or the applicable Lender satisfactory to such Swingline Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, to defease any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder.
In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, each Swingline Lender and each Issuing Lender each agree that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lenders Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Syndicated Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.
ARTICLE III
Guarantee
SECTION 3.01.    
The Guarantee.
The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby jointly and severally, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, guarantee to each Lender, each other holder of a Guaranteed Obligation (as hereinafter defined) and the Administrative Agent and their respective successors and assigns the prompt payment in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the principal of and interest on the Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrower and all fees, indemnification payments and other amounts whatsoever, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, now or hereafter from time to time owing to the Lenders or the Administrative Agent by the Borrower under this Agreement and by any Obligor under any of the other Loan Documents, in each case strictly in accordance with the terms thereof and including all interest, fees and expenses accrued or incurred subsequent to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings with respect to the Borrower, whether or not such interest, fees or expenses are allowed as a claim in such proceeding (such obligations being herein collectively called the 
Guaranteed Obligations
). The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby further jointly and severally agree that if the Borrower shall fail to pay in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) any of
46
the Guaranteed Obligations, the Subsidiary Guarantors will promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal.
SECTION 3.02.    
Obligations Unconditional.
The obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under Section 3.01 are absolute and unconditional, joint and several, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein, or any substitution, release or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor, it being the intent of this Section that the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional, joint and several, under any and all circumstances. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that the occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not alter or impair the liability of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder, which shall remain absolute and unconditional as described above:
(i)    at any time or from time to time, without notice to the Subsidiary Guarantors, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or compliance shall be waived;
(ii)    any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein shall be done or omitted;
(iii)    the maturity of any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be accelerated, or any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be modified, supplemented or amended in any respect, or any right under this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein shall be waived or any other guarantee of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security therefor shall be released or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with; or
(iv)    any lien or security interest granted to, or in favor of, the Administrative Agent or any Lender or Lenders as security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall fail to be perfected.
The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby expressly waive diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all notices whatsoever. Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that its guarantee hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and hereby expressly waives any requirement that the Administrative Agent or any Lender exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against the Borrower under this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein, or against any other Person under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Guaranteed Obligations.

ARTICLE IX
Agency
SECTION 9.01.    
Administrative Agent.
Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the entity named as Administrative Agent in the heading of this Agreement and
61
its successors to serve as Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, and neither the Borrower nor any other Obligor shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of such provisions.
The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender, an Issuing Lender or a Swingline Lender as any other Lender, Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders or the Swingline Lenders.
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:
(a)    shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;
(b)    shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02);
provided
that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or be contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law; and
(c)    shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct (with such absence to be presumed unless otherwise determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and nonappealable judgment). The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice describing such Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower, a Lender, an Issuing Lender or a Swingline Lender.
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (a) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (b) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (c) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document or the occurrence of any Default, (d) the sufficiency, validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (e) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article V or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not
62
have any liability arising from any confirmation of the Revolving Credit Exposure or the component amounts thereof.
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or such Issuing Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or such Issuing Lender prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for an Obligor), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more subagents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such subagent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such subagent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such subagent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, or required if an Event of Default under clauses (a), (b), (h) or (i) of Article VIII has occurred and is continuing), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States of America, or an Affiliate of any such bank. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above
provided
that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (a) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (b) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and each Issuing Lender directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this paragraph. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agents resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its subagents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.
Each Lender, each Issuing Lender and each Swingline Lender acknowledges that it has,
63
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any other Lender, any Issuing Lender, any Swingline Lender or any Arranger or any of their Related Parties, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender, each Issuing Lender and each Swingline Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any other Lender any Issuing Lender, any Swingline Lender or any Arranger or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
Except as otherwise provided in Section 10.02(b) with respect to this Agreement, the Administrative Agent may, with the prior consent of the Required Lenders (but not otherwise), consent to any modification, supplement or waiver under any of the Loan Documents.

SECTION 10.02.    
Waivers; Amendments.
(a)
No Deemed Waivers; Remedies Cumulative.
No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Obligor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
(b)    
Amendments.
Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders;
provided
that no such agreement shall:
(i)    increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender,
65
(ii)    reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement outstanding to any Lender or reduce the rate of interest thereon (except in connection with the waiver of applicability of any post-default increase in interest rates pursuant to Section 2.13(d)), or reduce any fees payable to any Lender hereunder, without the written consent of such Lender,
(iii)    postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement outstanding to any Lender, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable to any Lender hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment of any Lender, without the written consent of such Lender,
(iv)    change Section 2.18(b), 2.18(c) or 2.18(d) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby,
(v)    change any of the provisions of this Section or the percentage in the definition of the term Required Lenders or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby, or
(vi)    release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from their guarantee obligations under Article III without the written consent of each Lender, and
provided
further
that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Swingline Lender hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Swingline Lender, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding the foregoing (but subject to the immediately preceding proviso), (A) any amendment of the definition of the term Applicable Rate pursuant to the last sentence of such definition shall require only the written consent of the Borrower and the Required Lenders, (B) no consent with respect to any amendment, waiver or other modification of this Agreement shall be required of any Defaulting Lender, except with respect to any amendment, waiver or other modification referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first proviso of this paragraph and then only in the event such Defaulting Lender shall be directly affected by such amendment, waiver or other modification, (C) the Administrative Agent may enter into one or more security agreements (including mortgages and pledge agreements) in connection with any grant of a security interest securing Indebtedness under this Agreement as contemplated by Sections 7.02(l) and 7.04 without the consent of any Lender and (D) this Agreement may be amended (or amended and restated) with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (x) to add one or more additional credit facilities to this Agreement and to permit the extensions of credit from time to time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof to share in the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (y) to include appropriately the Lenders holding such credit facilities in any determination of the Required Lenders.

provided
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or its Related Parties or (y) result from a claim brought in good faith by the Borrower or any other Obligor against an Indemnitee for breach in bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitees obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document.

provided
that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such subagent), such Issuing Lender or such Swingline Lender in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such subagent), such Issuing Lender or such Swingline Lender in connection with such capacity.

Assignments Generally.
Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees (other than any natural person) all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) of:
(A)    the Borrower;
provided
that (x) no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee, and (y) the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice the Administrative Agent within 10 Business Days after having confirmed receipt of notice thereof;

provided
that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;

Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.

provided
that if either the assigning Lender or the assignee shall have failed to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(e) or 2.06(f), 2.07(b), 2.18(d) or 10.03(c), the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information therein in the Register unless and until such payment shall have been made in full, together with all accrued interest thereon. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.
(c)    
Participations.
(i)    
Participations Generally.
Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Swingline Lender, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a 
Participant
) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it);
provided
that (A) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 10.02(b) that directly and adversely affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Sections 2.17(f) and 2.17(g) (it being understood that the documentation required under Sections 2.17(f) and 2.17(g) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender,
provided
that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(d) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender selling participations shall keep a register (the 
Participant Register
) in which it shall record the name and address of each Participant to which such Lender sells participations and the amount and terms of such participations, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower;
provided
that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
(ii)    
Limitations on Rights of Participants.
A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.17(f) as though it were a Lender.
70
(d)    
Certain Pledges.
Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;
provided
that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
SECTION 10.05.    
Survival.
All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17, 2.18(f), 3.03 and 10.03 and Article IX shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness; Electronic Execution.
(a)
Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.

This Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent, constitute the entire contract between and among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof (but do not supersede any provisions of any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Lender). Except as provided in Section 5.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto.

SECTION 10.07.    
Severability.

provided
that if any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders (including the Swingline Lender). Each Lender (including any Defaulting Lender) agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such application made by such Lender,
provided
