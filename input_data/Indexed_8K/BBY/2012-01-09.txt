Effective January 9, 2012, Kathy J. Higgins Victor, a member of the Board of Directors of Best Buy Co., Inc. (Best Buy or the registrant) adopted a pre-arranged trading plan (the Plan) to sell shares of the registrant's common stock. The Plan was designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and the registrant's policies regarding stock transactions. Under Rule 10b5-1, directors, officers and other persons who are not in possession of material non-public information may adopt a pre-arranged plan or contract for the purchase or sale of the registrant's securities under specified conditions and at specified times to achieve prudent and gradual asset diversification over time.
Ms. Higgins Victor informed the registrant that the stock sales to be effected pursuant to the Plan are part of her personal program for tax and financial planning. The Plan will not reduce Ms. Higgins Victors' ownership of the registrant's shares below the registrant's applicable director stock ownership guidelines.
The Plan provides that Ms. Higgins Victor may sell shares beginning in February 2012. Shares will be sold under the Plan in the open market at prevailing market prices, subject to minimum price thresholds. Ms. Higgins Victor will have no control over the timing of the stock sales under the Plan. The Plan is scheduled to expire on April 30, 2012.
All stock sales under the Plan will be disclosed publicly in accordance with applicable securities laws, rules and regulations through appropriate filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The information in this Item 7.01 of the registrant's Current Report on Form 8-K is being furnished and shall not be deemed to be filed for the purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. Furthermore, the information in this Item 7.01 of the registrant's Current Report on Form 8-K shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, unless such subsequent filing specifically references this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The registrant does not undertake to report other Rule 10b5-1 plans that may be adopted by any officers or directors of the registrant in the future, or to report any modifications or termination of any publicly announced plan or to report any plan adopted by an employee who is not an executive officer, except to the extent required by law.
