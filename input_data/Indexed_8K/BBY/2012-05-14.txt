AGREEMENT AND RELEASE OF CLAIMS
This Agreement and Release of Claims (the Agreement) is entered into by and between Brian J. Dunn (the Executive) and Best Buy Co., Inc. (the Company). Collectively, the Executive and the Company are hereinafter referred to as the Parties.
WHEREAS, the Executive was recently employed at-will by the Company as its President and Chief Executive Officer;
WHEREAS, the Executive resigned his employment from the Company effective April 9, 2012;
 
WHEREAS, the Company hereby advises the Executive to review this Agreement with an attorney before signing this Agreement and the Executive is being provided with at least 21 days from the date he receives this Agreement to do so; and
    
WHEREAS, the Executive must sign and return this Agreement by June 4, 2012.
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises contained herein, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged by the Parties, the Company and the Executive agree as follows:
1.
Resignation Date.
The Executive's effective date of resignation from the Company was April 9, 2012 (the Resignation Date). As of the Resignation Date, all salary from the Company ceased and any benefits the Executive had as of the Resignation Date under Company-provided benefit plans, programs, or practices terminated, except as required by federal or state law, as described in this Agreement, or as vested under the Company's Retirement Savings Plan, the Company's Fifth Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended, the employee stock purchase plan, and equity incentive plans. As of the Resignation Date, Executive has $106,742.33 of accrued and unpaid vacation,
which shall be immediately paid to the Executive.
2.
Description of Separation Benefits.
In return for the Executive's timely execution and return, and nonrevocation, of this Agreement, and his compliance with the terms of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the non-competition and non-solicitation provisions in Section 5 below, the Company agrees to provide the Executive with the following separation benefits:
(a)
Severance Pay
. The Company will pay to the Executive $2,850,000, to be paid (i) $100,000 within 10 business days after the Effective Date (as defined in Section 12 below), and (ii) $2,750,000 in bi-weekly installments in accordance with the Company's regular payroll practices (the Severance Pay) over the 36-month period following the Resignation Date;
provided
,
however
, that the Executive will cease to have any entitlement to, and will repay within 10 business days, any amounts paid with respect to the period after the Resignation Date if this agreement is revoked by the Executive as provided under Section 12 below.
(b)
Fiscal Year 2012 Bonus
. Based on criteria used to determine other similarly-situated employees' Fiscal Year 2012 Bonus, the Company has determined that the Executive will be eligible to receive $1,140,000 as the Fiscal Year 2012 Bonus. Such bonus will be paid to the Executive in one lump-sum payment within 10 business days following the Effective Date.
(c)
Medical Insurance Continuation
. The Company will pay all insurance premiums and take all such other actions as reasonably necessary for the Executive and his covered beneficiaries, if any, to continue receiving group health insurance from the Company for 36 months following the Resignation Date, which coverage will be substantially the same as that offered during such period to active senior executive level employees of the Company, provided that the coverage will cease if the Executive and his covered beneficiaries become eligible for coverage under a new employer's group health coverage that is at least substantially comparable to the Company's group health insurance and in such event the Company shall reimburse the Executive for the amounts that the Executive is required to pay for such new employer's group health coverage during the remaining 36 months following the Resignation Date. The Executive shall complete such forms and take such other actions as reasonably requested by the Company in order for the Company to provide the group health insurance coverage pursuant to this Section 2(c).
(d)

(b)
Remedies
.
(i)
The Executive agrees that the restrictions set forth in Sections 4, 5, and 9 of this Agreement are fair and reasonable, and are reasonably required for the protection of the Company. The Executive further agrees that, since it would be difficult to measure precisely the damage caused the Company by a breach of these Sections, if the Executive has materially violated or is materially violating any or all of these Sections, the Company shall have the right to immediately cease payment of any future Severance Pay to which the Executive would otherwise be entitled under Section 2, and the provisions of Section 5(b)(ii) shall apply to his equity compensation; provided that, if the arbitrator under Section 15 determines that there was no such breach, the Company shall pay all Severance Pay that is owing to the Executive with interest at the rate of 3% from the date on which such payment was due. The Executive will also be obligated to repay any Severance Pay previously paid to him within 10 business days of the determination by the arbitrator under Section 15 that the Executive materially violated such provisions. The Executive agrees that, if the Company ceases to continue to pay him the Severance Pay under the circumstances described herein and/or he is required to repay to the Company any of the amounts described in this Section 5(b), the enforceability of Sections 3-5 and 9 of this Agreement will not be affected. The remedies under this Section 5(b) are in addition to any other remedies that the Company may have available in law or equity. The Executive also agrees that, in the event of any material breach or threatened material breach of Sections 4, 5, and/or 9 of this Agreement by him, the Company, in addition to such other remedies that may be available, shall have the right to obtain specific performance and injunctive relief without posting a bond. The Executive hereby waives the adequacy of a remedy at law as a defense to such relief.
(ii)
If the arbitrator under Section 15 determines that the Executive has materially breached any restrictions set forth in Sections 4, 5, and 9 of this Agreement, the Company may, in its sole discretion, impose any or all of the following consequences on the Executive, with any questions as to valuation of the following forms of compensation to also be within the sole discretion of the Company:
(1)
no further vesting of restricted stock or other outstanding equity compensation will occur;
(2)
any then outstanding exercisable equity compensation, whether vested or not, will immediately expire and be forfeited without payment by the Company;
(3)
as to any portions of any stock options exercised after the Resignation Date, the Executive will make prompt payment to the Company of any Option Gain on such portions. For purposes of this Agreement, the Option Gain per share the Executive received on exercise of an option is an amount equal to (i) the spread between the closing price on the date of exercise and the exercise price he paid, minus (ii) the federal and Minnesota state income tax rate applicable to the ordinary income realized by the Executive upon such option exercise; and
(4)
payment or transfer to the Company of any Stock Gain from restricted stock vesting after the Resignation Date, where the Stock Gain for purposes of this Agreement is an amount equal to (i) the value of the applicable shares at the date they were vested or distributed after the Resignation Date, minus (ii) the federal and Minnesota state income tax rate applicable to the ordinary income realized by the Executive upon such vesting or distribution.
Payment is due with respect to Section 5(b)(ii) in cash or cash equivalents within 10 business days after the arbitrator under Section 15 determines that the Executive has materially breached the restrictions set forth in Sections 4, 5, and 9 of this Agreement. Payment will be calculated on a net after tax basis, with reduction for federal and Minnesota state income taxes.
-

-
The Company may, but is not required to, accept a retransfer of Company stock in lieu of some or all of the payment, the value of which stock shall be determined based on the fair market value of such shares on the date of the retransfer, and if the Company refuses to accept Company stock, then the restrictions under the last sentence in Section 2(d) shall no longer apply.
(c)
Enforcement
. If any restriction set forth in Section 4 or 5 is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it extends for too long a period of time or over too great a range of activities or in too broad a geographic area, it shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time, range of activities or geographic area as to which it may be enforceable.
(d)
Extension
. If the Executive violates any provision of this Section 5, the Executive shall continue to be held by the restrictions set forth in this Section 5 until a period equal to the period of restriction has expired without any violation of any such provisions.
6.
Indemnification.
The Company agrees that the Executive is not releasing any claims he may have for indemnification under state or other law or the charter, articles, or by-laws of the Company and its affiliates, or under any indemnification agreement with the Company or under any insurance policy providing directors' and officers' coverage for any lawsuit or claim relating to the period when the Executive was a director or officer of the Company or any affiliate;
provided
,
however
, that (a) the Company's execution of this Agreement is not a concession or guaranty that the Executive has any such rights to indemnification, (b) this Agreement does not create any additional rights to indemnification, and (c) the Company and its affiliates retain any defenses they may have to such indemnification or coverage.

The Executive further confirms that he has cancelled all accounts for his benefit, if any, in the Company's name, including but not limited to, credit cards, telephone charge cards, cellular phone and/or pager accounts and computer accounts.
8.
Business Expenses and Final Compensation
. The Executive acknowledges that he has been reimbursed by the Company for all business expenses incurred in conjunction with the performance of his employment and that no other reimbursements are owed to him., except for business expenses not yet submitted not to exceed $2,500. The Executive further acknowledges that he has received payment in full for all services rendered in conjunction with his employment by the Company and that no other compensation, including wages, bonuses, and severance, is owed to him, except as otherwise provided in the Agreement or by payment under any deferred compensation plan in which he participated (to be made in accordance with such plan's terms).

Notwithstanding the above, the Executive may disclose the information described in this Section 9, and in Section 4 of this Agreement, as may be required by law, pursuant to a court order, a subpoena, or a government or administrative investigation;
provided
,
however
, the Executive shall immediately notify the Company of his intention to make such disclosure, and comply with the notice requirements below.
The Executive, his agents and/or representatives, including, but not limited to, counsel, if served with a subpoena, discovery request or other similar legal instrument that could result in the disclosure of information described in this Section 9, and/or in Section 4 of this Agreement, shall within seven days of the receipt thereof, notify the Company, unless seven days notice would not permit sufficient time in which to allow the Company to assert any interest in prohibiting disclosure, in which case the Executive will give notice to the Company as soon as possible, but in any event, before disclosure.

The arbitrator shall be an Article III retired judge mutually acceptable to the Parties, or if the Parties fail to agree on an arbitrator, such Article III retired judge as is designated by the Chief Judge for the District of Minnesota upon the request of either of the Parties. The place of arbitration under this Section 15 shall be in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Any claim or controversy not submitted to arbitration in accordance with this paragraph shall be waived, and thereafter no arbitration panel or tribunal or court shall have the power to rule or make any award on any such claim or controversy.

This Agreement is binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective agents, assigns, heirs, executors, successors and administrators. In the event of the death of the Executive, the severance benefits under Section 2 shall be paid to the estate or beneficiary of the Executive. Neither the death nor disability of the Executive shall relieve the Company of its obligations under this Agreement. No delay or omission by the Company in exercising any right under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of that or any other right. A waiver or consent given by the Company on any one occasion shall be effective only in that instance and shall not be construed as a bar to or waiver of any right on any other occasion.
17.
Cooperation.
During the 36 months immediately following the Resignation Date, the Executive agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Company in the investigation, defense or prosecution of any claims or actions now in existence or that may be brought in the future against or on behalf of the Company by any third party against the Company or by the Company against any third party and with respect to which the Executive has personal knowledge in his capacity as an officer of the Company. The Executive also agrees that his reasonable cooperation in connection with such claims or actions shall include, but not be limited to, being reasonably available to meet with the Company's counsel to prepare for discovery, any mediation, arbitration, trial, administrative hearing or other proceeding, and to act as a witness when requested by the Company at reasonable times and locations designated by the Company. Moreover, unless otherwise prohibited by law, the Executive agrees to notify the General Counsel of the Company if he is asked by any person, entity or agency to assist, testify or provide information in any such proceeding or investigation.

The Company agrees to reimburse the Executive for his reasonable out of pocket costs in providing cooperation under this Section 17, including travel expenses, meals and lodging.
18.
Tax Provision.
In connection with the separation benefits provided to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement, the Company will withhold and remit to the tax authorities the amounts required under applicable law, and the Executive shall be responsible for all applicable taxes with respect to such separation benefits under applicable law.

Best Buy Releases Results of Independent Investigation;
New Chairman of the Board Elected
MINNEAPOLIS, May 14, 2012  The Board of Directors of Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY) announced that on Saturday, May 12, 2012, it elected director Hatim Tyabji to succeed Richard Schulze as Chairman of the Company, effective at the conclusion of the annual meeting on June 21, 2012. Mr. Tyabji, currently Chairman of the Audit Committee, has served as a director since 1998.
When Mr. Schulze steps down as Chairman, he will become Founder and Chairman Emeritus, an honorary position. Mr. Schulze will serve out the remainder of his term as director through June 2013.
Hatim's history of leadership combines technology, retail, financial and mobile experience at the most senior levels, said lead independent director Matthew Paull. He has founded companies, chaired and served on boards and successfully led enterprises through long-term growth and change. The Board is grateful for his many years of service and is pleased to expand his role to Chairman.
The story of Best Buy is a remarkable American success story, said incoming Chairman Hatim Tyabji. Dick's leadership and vision changed the landscape of American retail, and he will forever be remembered as an iconic entrepreneur. We join Best Buy's 167,000 employees in thanking him.
The Board also publicly released the results of an independent investigation into personal conduct allegations involving former CEO Brian Dunn, who resigned in April. When these allegations, which were unrelated to the company's operations or financial controls, were brought to the Board's attention, the Audit Committee immediately initiated an investigation. Prior to the completion of the investigation, Mr. Dunn resigned.
When the Audit Committee was first informed of the allegations in mid-March 2012, it hired outside law firm WilmerHale to conduct an independent investigation. In the interest of transparency and accountability, the board made a commitment to publicly release the findings.
Key findings of the investigation include:
In December, when the conduct of our then-CEO was brought to my attention, I confronted him with the allegations (which he denied), told him his conduct was totally unacceptable and contrary to Best Buy's policies and everything I, and the Company, stand for. I understand and accept the findings of the Audit Committee, said Mr. Schulze.
In light of these findings, the Audit Committee of the Board will launch an effort to review and enhance, if appropriate, Best Buy's relevant corporate policies and procedures. The goal of this review is to ensure a positive and consistent workplace environment for all employees at all levels.
In addition to electing a new chairman, the independent directors of the board have moved from a neutral position to a recommendation that the shareholders approve the shareholder proposal recommending declassification of the Board, which would require every director to stand for reelection on an annual basis.
As a Board, we support the proposal for annual elections as an additional demonstration of our commitment to strong corporate governance practices. Each of us  with no exceptions  will be subject to approval by the shareholders on an annual basis, said Mr. Tyabji.

Investigation Methodology
The inquiry relied upon voluminous interviews, documents and other data. The inquiry included 45 interviews of 34 current or former employees; searches of e-mails and other documents on the CEO's and the female employee's computers; a review of relevant internal ethics complaints; a survey of personnel records; a review of the CEO's and the female employee's purchase records using their employee discount; an analysis of the log of products the CEO tested as product samples; and an analysis of the CEO's and the female employee's Company phone records. The Company did not have access to the CEO's complete personal cell phone records. In addition, the Company's Internal Audit staff performed an in-depth analysis of expense reports, records reflecting corporate use of aircraft, and records of the CEO's use of a Company credit card over a three-year period.
Mr. Dunn's Separation Agreement

The separation agreement is comprised of a previously earned bonus for FY 2012, vesting of previously awarded restricted stock, a severance payment and an unused vacation payment.
Using the May 11, 2012, stock price for calculation, the estimated total value of the severance package is $

REPORT
OF THE
AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF
DIRECTORS OF BEST BUY
TO THE
BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF BEST BUY
REGARDING
INVESTIGATION OF ALLEGED
MISCONDUCT BY FORMER CHIEF
EXECUTIVE OFFICER
May 12, 2012
This report by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Best Buy Co., Inc. (Best Buy or the Company) presents the results of an inquiry involving an allegedly inappropriate relationship between former Chief Executive Officer Brian Dunn (the CEO), age 51, and a subordinate, 29-year-old female employee (the female employee). The purpose of the inquiry was to determine whether the relationship involved violations of Company policy or improper use of Company resources.
The inquiry relied upon voluminous interviews, documents, and other data. The inquiry included 45 interviews of 34 current or former employees; searches of e-mails and other documents on the CEOs and the female employees computers; a review of relevant internal ethics complaints; a survey of personnel records; a review of the CEOs and the female employees purchase records using their employee discount; an analysis of the log of products the CEO tested as product samples; and an analysis of the CEOs and the female employees Company phone records. The Company did not have access to the CEOs complete personal cell phone records but did have copies of limited invoices for the CEOs personal cell phone containing only nine days of itemized usage data during two trips abroad in 2011. In addition, the Companys Internal Audit staff performed an in-depth analysis of expense reports, records reflecting corporate use of aircraft, and records of the CEOs use of a Company credit card over a three-year period.
The CEO violated Company policy by engaging in an extremely close personal relationship with a female employee that negatively impacted the work environment. He also violated Company policy by soliciting from a vendor a complimentary ticket for the female employee. His relationship with the female employee demonstrated extremely poor judgment and a lack of professionalism, but the inquiry revealed no misuse of Company resources. The inquiry also revealed no misuse of aircraft. In addition, as part of the investigation, it was determined that the Chairman of the Board of Directors (the Chairman) acted inappropriately when he failed to bring the matter to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors in December 2011, when the allegations were first raised with him.
The CEO maintained an inappropriate relationship with the female employee that disrupted the work environment. Several employees witnessed the CEO visit with the female employee in his office and alone in conference rooms. The female employee spoke openly and frequently in the workplace about her friendship with the CEO and the favors he provided to her. The growing awareness and speculation surrounding the relationship created friction and disruption in the workplace and, according to her supervisor, impeded efforts to supervise the female employee.
Both the CEO and the female employee acknowledged numerous social meetings outside the office, including lunches and drinks both during the work week and on the weekend. The CEO also gave the female employee tickets to at least seven concerts and sporting events. At one concert in Las Vegas, the CEO solicited a vendor for a complimentary ticket for the female employee. The CEO also loaned the female employee $600 of personal money so that she could change her plane ticket from Las Vegas and allowed her to use an empty hotel room not paid for by the Company or by her.
Further, the CEO and the female employee engaged in a significant amount of communication by text and cell phone for which there was no identifiable business purpose. During one four-day and one five-day trip abroad during 2011, the CEO contacted the female employee by cell phone at least 224 times, including 33 phone calls, 149 text messages, and 42 picture or video messages. In one instance, several photographs were discovered on the CEOs personal cell phone that contained messages expressing affection, one of which included the female employees initials.
Both the CEO and the female employee have stated that the relationship was a close friendship that was not romantic or otherwise improper. Even accepting those statements as true, the relationship nevertheless reflected extremely poor judgment by the CEO. His conduct toward the female employee damaged employee morale and created unnecessary distraction in the workplace. The frequency and level of interaction between the CEO and the female employee became sufficiently well known at Company headquarters that it generated speculation about the nature of the relationship, especially due to the disparity in position, power, and age between the CEO and the female employee. This disruption in the workplace was exacerbated when the female employee openly discussed with her colleagues her relationship with the CEO. In addition, the CEOs perceived favoritism toward the female employee undermined her supervisors ability to manage her. Further, the CEOs relationship with this employee led some employees to question senior managements commitment to Company policy and the ethical principles the Company champions. During interviews, some employees said that they felt that the rules appeared to apply to every employee except the CEO. In the Audit Committees view, the CEOs behavior was unprofessional and damaging to the work

environment and evidenced a lack of the judgment expected of the most senior executive officer of the Company.
Company policy prohibits any behavior not consistent with our Company values or that negatively impacts the work environment. Company policy also requires employees to disclose or avoid any activity or interest that may be regarded as a possible conflict with Best Buys interest. A conflict of interest occurs when an employee places, or gives the appearance of placing, personal interests ahead of, or at the expense of, the interests of Best Buy while doing Company business. Further, Company policy prohibits employees from receiving gifts of value from vendors. The Audit Committee finds that the CEO violated Company policy by allowing his relationship with the female employee to negatively impact the work environment, by placing his interest in the relationship ahead of Company interests, and by soliciting a complimentary ticket from a vendor for the female employee.
Allegations about the inappropriate relationship first came to the attention of the Chairman in December 2011. At that time, a Company executive provided the Chairman with a written statement from another employee containing specific allegations about a possible inappropriate relationship between the CEO and the female employee. After receipt of the statement, the Chairman confronted the CEO and handed him a copy of the written statement, which was signed by the employee who had raised the concerns. The CEO adamantly denied any inappropriate conduct or romantic relationship with respect to the female employee. Following this conversation, the Chairman did not share information about the conversation, the CEOs denial, or any of the related allegations with the Audit Committee, the General Counsel, the head of Human Resources, the Chief Ethics Officer, or any other Board member. The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee learned about these issues for the first time from the General Counsel in mid-March 2012, after allegations of the inappropriate relationship came to the attention of a senior Human Resources employee.
The Companys Audit Committee charter assigns oversight responsibility for ethics matters to the Audit Committee. Given the specificity and potential gravity of the allegations, the Chairmans decision to unilaterally address the situation without promptly notifying the Audit Committee was inconsistent with the Audit Committees responsibility for such matters pursuant to its charter. The Audit Committee should have had the opportunity to independently assess the concerns that had been raised and to determine the appropriate course of action, as happened in mid-March 2012 when the allegations first were presented to the Audit Committee. Moreover, it was inappropriate for the Chairman to show the CEO the signed, written statement containing the allegations. In doing so, the Chairman revealed to the CEO the identity of the female employee, the employee who authored the statement, and other employees mentioned in the statement. This action exposed the employees to potential retaliation and exposed the Company to potential liability for such retaliation. More generally, improper handling of employee allegations discourages employees from reporting potentially improper behavior to their supervisors, adversely affects the Companys governance, and inhibits its ability to run an effective ethical compliance program.
We find that the CEO violated Company policies with respect to inappropriate conduct, conflicts of interest, and vendor gifts, but we find no evidence of misuse of Company resources. As the CEO of a publicly held company, he was in a position in which his leadership skills were critical to his capacity to oversee approximately 167,000 employees and to maintain the confidence of shareholders and investors. Here, the CEO developed a close personal relationship with a subordinate that negatively impacted the work environment. Such behavior was disruptive and reflected poorly on the CEOs judgment. Further, by unilaterally confronting the CEO in December 2011, the Chairman failed to act in a manner consistent with the Audit Committees mandate and good governance practices, and he created serious risks of employee retaliation and Company liability.
