On August 20, 2012, Best Buy Co., Inc. (Best Buy or the registrant) announced that its Board of Directors (the Board) appointed Hubert Joly, 53, as Best Buy's President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The effectiveness of Mr. Joly's appointment as President and CEO is subject to and conditioned upon the approval of his registrant-sponsored U.S. work authorization permitting Mr. Joly to commence employment with Best Buy. The registrant anticipates that, if Mr. Joly's work authorization is approved, his employment will commence in early September. Until such time as Mr. Joly's employment with the registrant commences, George L. Mikan III, a current director of the registrant, will continue to serve as interim CEO and thereafter will continue to be a director of the registrant and become chair of the registrant's Audit Committee of the Board.
Over the past 15 years, Mr. Joly has held senior executive positions and led turnarounds and growth strategies in the technology, media and services sectors and demonstrated skills and qualifications that the Board deemed necessary to the CEO role.
Since 2008, Mr. Joly has been the CEO of Carlson, the worldwide hospitality and travel company headquartered in Minneapolis, which includes a hotel business (Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group) with more than 1,300 hotels in operation and development, including Radisson Blu, Radisson, Park Plaza, Park Inn by Radisson, Country Inns & Suites By Carlson and Hotel Missoni; a restaurant business, with more than 900 T.G.I.

Prior to becoming chief executive officer of Carlson, Mr. Joly was president and CEO of Carlson Wagonlit Travel (2004-2008) and held a series of senior executive positions with Vivendi S.A. and its subsidiaries (1999-2004) and with Electronic Data Systems (now part of Hewlett-Packard Company) in France (1996-1999). Mr. Joly also was with McKinsey & Company, Inc., working with clients in the technology, financial services and luxury industries (1983-1996).
Mr. Joly is a graduate of cole des Hautes tudes Commerciales de Paris (HEC Paris) and the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris. He was elected a Global Leader for Tomorrow by the World Economic Forum (Davos, 1997-1999) and is a knight in the French National Order of Merit. He serves as a member of the board of directors of Ralph Lauren Corp., the Rezidor Hotel Group (where he is vice chair), and on several not-for-profit and charitable organizations in and around Minneapolis. Mr. Joly has also previously served as chair of the board of directors of Carlson Wagonlit Travel, a member of Carlson's board of directors, chair of the Travel Facilitation Sub-Committee of the U.S. Department of Commerce Travel and Tourism Advisory Board, and on the executive committee of the World Travel and Tourism Council.
Mr. Joly has no direct or indirect material interest in any transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.
 
In connection with Mr. Joly's appointment, the registrant entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Joly dated August 19, 2012 (the Agreement), pursuant to which Mr. Joly has also been appointed to the registrant's Board, effective as of the start date of his employment with the registrant. The principal terms of the Agreement are described below.

Commencing in fiscal 2014, Mr. Joly will be eligible for annual long-term incentive compensation awards as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board.

Buy-out Awards
To compensate Mr. Joly for certain forfeitures incurred upon termination of his employment with his prior employer, the registrant will grant to Mr. Joly certain buy-out awards as summarized below, subject to and effective upon commencement of his employment with the registrant.

(1)    a buy-out cash award of $3.5 million;
(2)    a grant of fully vested shares of common stock of the registrant under the 2004 Ominbus Stock and Incentive Plan (the LTIP) valued at $3.0 million on the date of grant (the Buy-Out Stock Award). Mr. Joly has agreed to hold such shares for at least two years from the date of grant or, if earlier, his termination.
(3)    a grant of restricted stock units (the RSUs) under the LTIP with a grant date value of $6.0 million, vesting in 36 equal monthly installments and, to the extent they become vested, payable six months after Mr. Joly's separation from the registrant.

(4)    a stock option grant (the Buy-Out Options) under the LTIP having a Black Scholes value of $3.75 million, an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the grant date (as defined in the LTIP), and vesting 25% on the date of grant and 75% in equal installments on the first three anniversaries of Mr. Joly's employment commencement date; and
(5)    a grant of performance share units (the PSUs) under the LTIP having a grant date accounting value, at target, of $3.75 million, subject to goals based on the performance of the registrant's total shareholder return (as defined in the Agreement), relative to a peer group, at the end of the 36-month period beginning on the first day of the month immediately following Mr. Joly's employment commencement date and three-year cliff time vesting on the last day of the performance period.
Employment Termination
Work Authorization
. In the event Mr. Joly's petition for U.S. work authorization is not approved permitting him to commence his employment by September 30, 2012, either the registrant or Mr. Joly may terminate the Agreement. In such event, and only if Mr. Joly's employment with his prior employer has been terminated and he had incurred a forfeiture of compensation as a result of such termination, Mr. Joly is entitled to receive a payment of $6.25 million from the registrant.
Buy-out Awards
. If Mr. Joly is terminated for Cause (as defined in the Agreement) or resigns without Good Reason (as defined in the Agreement) prior to the first anniversary of Mr. Joly's employment commencement date, the grant date after-tax value of his buy-out cash award and the net after-tax amount of the Buy-Out Stock Award must be repaid in full to the registrant within 30 days after such termination. If the registrant terminates Mr. Joly's employment without Cause, he resigns for Good Reason or his employment terminates due to his death or disability at any time, any unvested RSUs and Buy-Out Options will become fully vested, and the PSUs will vest on a pro rata basis based on the number of days Mr. Joly was employed during the performance period and achievement of performance goals through the date of termination. In such event, the vested Buy-Out Options will be exercisable for two years following such termination or resignation.
Change in Control
Generally
. In the event of Mr. Joly's termination by the registrant without Cause or voluntary termination for Good Reason upon or within one year after a change of control of the registrant (as defined in the Agreement), or in anticipation of or in connection with a change in control, Mr. Joly would be entitled to the benefits provided in the registrant's Severance Plan, except that he will be entitled to receive cash severance in an amount equal to two times the sum of his base salary plus target bonus, and he will be entitled to a pro rata annual bonus for the fiscal year in which such termination occurs determined based on actual performance in accordance with the STI Plan for such year.
Buy-out Awards
. In the event of a change of control of the registrant (as defined under the LTIP), the PSUs will be measured for performance on the date of the change of control and deemed earned at target or such greater number as have been already previously earned based on the terms of the award through the change of control date, and otherwise would vest and be payable in the same manner as provided above. The PSUs are subject to certain other adjustments as described in the Agreement.

Reduction of Payments in Certain Circumstances
.
(a)
During the Term, anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that the Company's independent auditors or such other nationally recognized certified public accounting firm as may be designated by the Company (the 
Accounting Firm
) determine that receipt of any payment or distribution by the Company or affiliates in the nature of compensation to or for your benefit, whether paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise (a 
Payment
) would subject you to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the Accounting Firm will determine whether to reduce any of the Payments paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement (including pursuant to any annual or long-term incentive award) (collectively and selectively, the 
Agreement Payments
) to the Reduced Amount (as defined below). The Agreement Payments will be reduced to the Reduced Amount only if the Accounting Firm determines that you would have a greater Net After-Tax Receipt (as defined below) of aggregate Payments if your Agreement Payments were reduced to the Reduced Amount. If the Accounting Firm determines that you would not have a greater Net After-Tax Receipt of aggregate Payments if your Agreement Payments were so reduced, you will receive all Agreement Payments to which you are entitled under this Agreement or otherwise. For purposes of this Section 10, (i) 
Reduced Amount
 shall mean the greatest amount of Agreement Payments that can be paid that would not result in the imposition of the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code if the Accounting Firm determines to reduce Agreement Payments pursuant to this Section 10(a); and (ii) 
Net After-Tax Receipt
 shall mean the present value (as determined in accordance with Sections 280G(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 280G(d)(4) of the Code) of a Payment net of all taxes imposed on you with respect thereto under Sections 1 and 4999 of the Code and under applicable state and local laws, determined by applying the highest marginal rate under Section 1 of the Code and under state and local laws which applied to your taxable income for the immediately preceding taxable year, or such other rate(s) as the Accounting Firm determined to be likely to apply to you in the relevant tax year(s).
(b)
If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate Agreement Payments should be reduced to the Reduced Amount, the Company will promptly give you notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 10 shall be binding upon the Company and you and will be made as soon as reasonably practicable and in no event later than thirty (30) days following the date of any termination of your employment. For purposes of reducing the Agreement Payments to the Reduced Amount, the reduction will be made by reducing the payments and benefits in the following order: (i) payments due under Section 9(b) hereof, (ii) payments due in respect of restricted stock units under any affected long-term incentive award, (iii) payments due in respect of performance share units under any affected long-term incentive award, and (iv) the forfeiture of such portion of any stock options constituting an excess parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.
(c)
As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of you pursuant
Page 6
Mr. Hubert Joly
August 19, 2012
to this Agreement which should not have been so paid or distributed (
Overpayment
) or that additional amounts which will have not been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of you pursuant to this Agreement could have been so paid or distributed (
Underpayment
), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against either the Company or you which the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success determines that an Overpayment has been made, you shall, except to the extent that it would cause a violation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, pay any such Overpayment to the Company together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code;
provided
,
however
, that no amount will be payable by you to the Company if and to the extent such payment would not either reduce the amount on which you is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment will be paid promptly (and in no event later than 60 days following the date on which the Underpayment is determined) by the Company to or for the benefit of you together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code.
(d)
The Company will use its good faith efforts to obtain from the Accounting Firm, at Company expense, for delivery to both you and the Company a more-likely-than-not opinion as to its conclusions.
11.
Covenants; Cooperation
. By entering into this Agreement and in consideration for the payments and benefits provided hereunder, the covenants and the remedies set forth in
Attachment B

16.
Attorneys Fees
. The Company will reimburse you for the reasonable attorneys fees you incur in connection with the negotiation and documentation of this agreement.
17.
Section 409A
. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding:
(a)
It is intended that any amounts payable under this Agreement will either be exempt from or comply with Section 409A of the Code (
Section 409A
) and all regulations, guidance and other interpretive authority issued thereunder so as not to subject you to payment of any additional tax, penalty or interest imposed under Section 409A, and this Agreement will be interpreted on a basis consistent with such intent.
(b)
To the extent that the reimbursement of any expenses or the provision of any in-kind benefits under this Agreement is subject to Section 409A, (i) the amount of such expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, during any one calendar year shall not affect the amount of such expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year (
provided
, that, this clause (i) will not be violated with regard to expenses reimbursed under any arrangement covered by Code Section 105(b) solely because such expenses are subject to a limit related to the period the arrangement is in effect); (ii) reimbursement of any such expense shall be made by no later than December 31 of the year following the calendar year in which such expense is incurred; and (iii) your right to receive such reimbursements or in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, any tax gross-up payment (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(v)) provided for in this Agreement shall be made to you no later than the end of your taxable year next following your taxable year in which you remit the related taxes.
(c)
If you are a specified employee within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A -1(i) as of the date of your separation from service (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(h)), then any payment or benefit pursuant to this Agreement on account of your separation from service, to the extent such payment constitutes
Page 9
Mr. Hubert Joly
August 19, 2012
non-qualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A and required to be delayed pursuant to Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code (after taking into account any exclusions applicable to such payment under Section 409A), shall not be made until the first business day after (i) the expiration of six (6) months from the date of your separation from service, or (ii) if earlier, the date of your death (the 
Delay Period
). Upon the expiration of the Delay Period, all payments and benefits delayed pursuant to this Section 17(c) (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) will be paid or reimbursed to you in a lump sum and any remaining payments and benefits due under this Agreement will be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits upon or following a termination of employment that are considered deferred compensation under Section 409A, references to your termination of employment (and corollary terms) with the Company shall be construed to refer to your separation from service (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(h)) with the Company.
(d)
Whenever payments under this Agreement are to be made in installments, each such installment shall be deemed to be a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A. Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days (e.g., payment will be made within thirty (30) days following the date of termination), the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Company.
(e)
To the extent any amount payable to you is subject to your entering into a release of claims with the Company and any such amount is a deferral of compensation under Section 409A and which amount could be payable in either of two taxable years for you, and the timing of such payment is not subject to terms and conditions under another plan, program or agreement of the Company that otherwise satisfies Section 409A, such payments shall be made or commence, as applicable, on January 15 (or any later date that is not earlier than 8 days after the date that the release becomes irrevocable) of such later taxable year and shall include all payments that otherwise would have been made before such date.

5.
Partial Invalidity
.

You acknowledge the uncertainty of the law in this respect and expressly stipulate that this Attachment B is to be given the construction that renders

Remedy for Breach
. You agree that a breach of any of the provisions of Sections 3, 4 or 5 of this Attachment B (collectively, the 
Restricted Covenants

You may retain your address books to the extent they only contain contact information.
8.
Cooperation
. You agree that, following termination of your employment for any reason, you will upon reasonable advance notice, and to the extent it does not interfere with previously scheduled travel plans and does not unreasonably interfere with other full-time business activities, employment obligations, or reasonably firm personal commitments, reasonably assist and cooperate with the Company with regard to any matter or project in which you were involved during your employment, including any litigation. The Company will reimburse your reasonable expenses incurred in connection with such cooperation and assistance.
9.
Assignment of Inventions
. You will promptly communicate and disclose in writing to the Company all inventions and developments including software, whether patentable or not, as well as patents and patent applications (hereinafter collectively called 
Inventions
), made, conceived, developed, or purchased by you, or under which you acquire the right to grant licenses or to become licensed, alone or jointly with others, which have arisen or jointly with others, which have arisen or may arise out of your employment, or relate to any matters pertaining to, or useful in connection therewith, the business or affairs of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

Except as otherwise stated, all references to Sections or Articles refer to Sections or Articles of this Agreement.
1
Award Date, provided that you are employed on the date such installment is scheduled to so vest (except as provided in Section 3.4(a)(ii)). The Option may only be exercised by you during your lifetime, and may not be assigned or transferred other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.

In such event, your obligation to continue employment until the last day of the Performance Period under Section 3.2(a) (except as provided in Section 3.4(a)(iii)) shall be unaffected by such Change of Control. Change of Control has the meaning defined in Appendix B hereto.
4
5
In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the Plan, the provisions of the Plan will govern. By your acceptance of this Award, you acknowledge receipt of a copy of the Prospectus for the Plan and your agreement to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement.
6
By signing below, you and Best Buy agree that the Option, RSUs and PSUs are granted under and governed by the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement.
    
7
APPENDIX A
Performance Stock Unit (PSU) Performance Goal
The performance of Best Buy common stock total shareholder return, relative to a peer group comprised of the S&P 500 Index, over the 36-month period commencing on
[insert the first day of the month immediately following the employment commencement date]
and ending on
[insert the last day of the applicable 36th month]
, except ending on the date of termination of employment for purposes of Section 3.4(a)(iii) or the date of the occurrence of a Change of Control in for purposes of Section 3.2(c), (the 
Performance Period
). The number of performance stock units that may be earned under this Award are as follows:
FIRST
: For Best Buy and for the companies comprising the S&P 500 Index, determine the TSR for the Performance Period. For purposes of this calculation, TSR will be calculated on a compounded annualized basis over the Performance Period.
SECOND
: Rank the TSR values determined in the first step from low to high (with the company having the lowest TSR being ranked number 1, the company with the second lowest TSR ranked
8
number 2, and so on) and determine Best Buy's percentile rank based upon its position in the list by dividing Best Buy's position by the total number of companies (including Best Buy) in the S&P 500 and rounding the quotient to the nearest hundredth. For example, if Best Buy were ranked 300 on the list out of 500 companies (including Best Buy), its percentile rank would be 60%.
THIRD
: Plot the percentile rank for Best Buy determined in the second step above into the appropriate band in the left-hand column of the table above and determine the number of PSUs earned as a percent of Target, which is the figure in the right-hand column of the table (using linear interpolation between points as provided in the table above) corresponding to that percentile rank. For example, if Best Buy's percentile rank is 60%, then 125% of the Target number of PSUs would be earned.
No Guaranteed Payout
: The minimum number of PSUs which may be earned is zero and the maximum number of PSUs which may be earned is 150% of the Target number of PSUs. There is no minimum number of PSUs or other consideration that will be paid out, and no PSUs will be earned if the percentile rank is less than the 30th percentile or lower in the Performance Period.
Effect of Changes on S&P 500 Index
: The S&P 500 Index shall be such companies as comprise that index from time to time during the Performance Period.

Best Buy Appoints Hubert Joly Chief Executive Officer
MINNEAPOLIS, August 20, 2012

(NYSE: BBY) today announced that its Board of Directors has appointed Hubert Joly, a leading global CEO with expertise in turnaround and growth across the media, technology and service sectors, as the companys President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of its Board of Directors.
Hubert was an outstanding candidate for this position and I am confident he will be a great fit for Best Buy, said Hatim Tyabji, chairman of the Best Buy Board. Huberts range and depth of experience in transforming companies is exactly what the company needs at the moment, as is his energetic, imaginative and experienced leadership in executing strategies.
Joly said, I am honored and excited to lead Best Buy. Best Buy has extraordinary assets -- including its 167,000 employees, its huge customer base, its distribution and service capabilities, its well-recognized brands, and its history of innovation. I look forward to working with the Companys management team and employees to pursue what are exciting growth opportunities for Best Buy  both online and offline, through a combination of competitive prices, superior service, new growth engines and innovations, as we deliver to millions of customers the technology solutions that enable easy access to people, knowledge, ideas and fun.
Kathleen J. Higgins Victor, a member of the Best Buy Board and chairwoman of the CEO search committee, said: Hubert is a strategic thinker with deep financial acumen and global experience leading large, international employee groups. Best Buy is a great company with great people, and I have every confidence that Hubert is the right person to expand Best Buys leading position in the marketplace.
Mr. Joly is expected to step into his role as President and Chief Executive Officer in early September when his visa is secured. Mr. Joly will succeed G. Mike Mikan, a member of the Board of Directors who has served as CEO (interim) since April. Mr. Mikan will continue to be the interim CEO until Mr. Jolys start date. Following that, Mr. Mikan will continue to serve on the Board, where he will take the position of chairman of the Audit Committee.
Mr. Mikan stepped in as CEO (interim) at a critical moment for Best Buy, stabilizing the company while making considerable progress on a comprehensive plan to return Best Buy to sustained, profitable growth. Under his leadership, Best Buy established relationships with Target, Verizon and AARP, signaling a new focus on services, in addition to the companys traditional retail mission.
We cant thank Mike enough for his service as CEO, Mr. Tyabji said. We asked Mike to step into a difficult situation, and he moved the company forward in the right direction. We were fortunate to have his guidance and energy. I look forward to his continued service on the Board in his new position as chair of the Audit Committee.
In addition, the Board of Directors is pleased to announce that Lisa Caputo and Sanjay Khosla will now serve on the boards Compensation Committee.
Building on the Companys strengths and ongoing work, I believe Best Buy has the capacity to write an exciting new chapter in its history. I sincerely look forward to writing this chapter with the Best Buy team and putting in place the short term and medium term actions that will help ensure its success, Joly said.
