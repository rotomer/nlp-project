Dear Mr. Schulze:
Richard M. Schulze (
you
) has requested information from Best Buy Co., Inc., a Minnesota corporation (the 
Company
), in connection with your consideration of a possible negotiated transaction between the Company and you or one or more of your affiliates (as defined below) (a 
Transaction
). In connection with a Transaction, and in consideration of the covenants and agreements contained in this letter agreement (this 
Agreement
), the Company and you agree as follows:

In connection with your consideration of a Transaction, the Company shall afford you and each of your Representatives (as defined below) with prompt access to the properties, books, contracts and records of the Company and its affiliates (including, to the extent available, the work papers of the Company's external auditors) necessary for you to provide the Company with a proposal for a Transaction. As used in this Agreement, 
Representatives
 of a person means such person's affiliates, officers, directors, employees, debt and equity financing sources, financial advisors, counsel, accountants, investment bankers and other advisors, agents or representatives of such person and/or any of its affiliates (provided, that (i) each of your debt financing sources and six equity financing sources shall only be considered your Representative upon prior written notice to the Company of the identity of such debt or equity financing source and (ii) all additional equity financing sources shall only be considered your Representative with the prior written consent of the Company, not to be unreasonably withheld, and in your case shall also include individuals who may assist in managing the Company following a Transaction but only if such individuals are not employees of the Company at the time they become your Representative; 
person
 means any individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, firm, joint venture, association, joint-stock company, trust, unincorporated organization, governmental or regulatory body or other entity; and 
affiliate
 has the meaning ascribed to such term in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 
Exchange Act
) (for the avoidance of doubt, you and the Company are not deemed to be affiliates for purposes of this Agreement).
(b)
You agree to keep confidential and to use only for the purpose of evaluating a Transaction and submitting a Qualified Offer and a Subsequent Qualified Offer all non-public information that the Company or any of its Representatives furnishes or otherwise makes available to you or your Representatives pursuant to this Agreement (whether on or after the date hereof), including any technical, scientific, trade secret or other proprietary information of the Company with which you or your Representatives may receive in the course of your
1
Exhibit 10.1
investigation, whether oral, written or electronic, together with any reports, analyses, compilations, forecasts, memoranda, notes, studies and any other written or electronic materials prepared by or for you or your Representatives that contain, reflect or are based upon such information (collectively, the 
Evaluation Material
);
provided
that the Evaluation Material may be disclosed (i) to your Representatives who need to know such information for the purpose of assisting you in your evaluation of a Transaction so long as you instruct your Representatives to treat the Evaluation Material in a confidential manner and in accordance with the terms hereof (
it
being
understood
that you will be responsible for any breach of the terms of this Agreement by any of your Representatives), (ii) to the extent that the Company consents in writing to such disclosure or (iii) in accordance with Section 1(c) or Section 1(d). The term Evaluation Material shall not include information that (A) was or becomes available to you or your Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company or its Representatives, provided that such other source is not known by you to be bound by a confidentiality obligation to the Company or is otherwise prohibited from disclosing the information to you or your Representatives, (B) was or becomes generally available to the public (other than as a result of a breach by you or your Representatives of this Agreement) or (C) is or becomes independently developed by you or on your behalf (other than as a result of a breach by you or your Representatives of this Agreement).
(c)
Each of the Company and you agrees that neither it nor its Representatives will, without the prior written consent of the other party, directly or indirectly, disclose to any other person (other than its Representatives) (i) the fact that discussions or negotiations may take place, are taking place or have taken place concerning a Transaction or any of the terms or other facts relating thereto, including the status thereof, (ii) the existence or the terms of this Agreement or (iii) that it or its Representatives have received or produced any Evaluation Material;
provided
that the Company and you may make such disclosure to the extent that the Company or you, as applicable, have received advice of counsel that such disclosure is required to be made in order to avoid violating the United States federal securities laws or similar foreign securities laws or rules of a United States or foreign securities exchange;
provided
,
further
, that any such disclosure must be limited to only that information which must be disclosed in order for the Company or you, as applicable, not to violate such United States federal securities laws or similar foreign securities laws or rules of a United States or foreign securities exchange to which you or any of your affiliates are subject. During the Standstill Period, to the extent legally permissible, the Company or you, as applicable, will notify the other party prior to making any such disclosure and, to the extent practicable in the circumstances, consult with the other party regarding the text of the disclosure language itself prior to any such disclosure being made. The Company and you agree to issue jointly the press release attached hereto as
Annex I
following execution of this Agreement.
(d)
In the event that you or any of your Representatives are required to disclose any Evaluation Material in connection with any judicial or administrative proceedings (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigation demand or similar process), you will provide the Company with prompt and, to the extent legally permissible, prior notice of such requirement(s). You also agree, unless prohibited by law, to provide the Company, in advance of any such disclosure, with a list of any Evaluation Material you are required to disclose (and, if applicable, the text of the disclosure language itself) and to cooperate with the Company (at the Company's expense) to the extent the Company may seek to
2
Exhibit 10.1
limit such disclosure, including, if requested, and at the Company's expense, taking all reasonable steps to resist or avoid any such judicial or administrative proceedings referred to above and to assist in obtaining an appropriate protective order. If and to the extent, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver from the Company after a request in writing therefor is made by you (such request to be made as soon as practicable to allow the Company a reasonable amount of time to respond thereto), you or your Representatives are legally required to disclose Evaluation Material to any tribunal or other governmental entity, you will use reasonable best efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to any such Evaluation Material and you will limit the disclosure to only that information which must be disclosed in order for you not to violate the legal requirements of the tribunal or other governmental entity and thereafter you or your Representatives, as applicable, may disclose such information without liability hereunder.
(e)
Upon the request of the Company (which request shall not be made at any time prior to the Proposal Deadline), you will (and will cause your Representatives to) promptly deliver to the Company or destroy, as requested by the Company, all copies of the Evaluation Material, without retaining any copy thereof, including, to the extent practicable, expunging all such Evaluation Material from any computer, word processor or other device containing such information;
provided
,
however
, that you are not required to delete electronic copies stored in backups or archives that are not generally available to the individual user. If requested by the Company, you will confirm to the Company that all such material has been so delivered or destroyed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or your Representative may keep one copy of the Evaluation Material (in electronic or paper form) if required by any applicable law or rules of a United States or foreign securities exchange to which you or one of your affiliates are subject or if otherwise required by any applicable law or regulation. Any and all duties and obligations existing under this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with Section 9, notwithstanding the delivery or destruction of the Evaluation Material required by this Section 1(e).

(d)
You understand and agree that any potential equity financing source who participates in a Qualified Offer or Subsequent Qualified Offer must agree in writing (in an instrument signed by you, the Company and any such party) to be bound by the restrictions contained in this Section 2 and equity and debt financing sources must enter into customary confidentiality agreements with the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of the provisions of this Agreement shall in any way limit the ordinary course business services and activities of any of your Representatives who are equity or debt financing sources;
provided
, that such ordinary course business services and activities are otherwise conducted without any use of or reference to the Evaluation Material.
(e)

Best Buy Board and Founder Richard Schulze Reach Agreement Permitting Schulze To Form Investment Group And Conduct Due Diligence
Minneapolis, Aug. 27, 2012  Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE: BBY) and founder Richard Schulze today announced that they have reached an agreement under which Mr. Schulze will be granted access to certain due diligence information and permission to form an investment group with private equity sponsors in furtherance of making a fully financed proposal to acquire the Company.
Best Buy stated that the agreement establishes a non-exclusive, orderly process which satisfies the requests made by Mr. Schulze, while at the same time protecting the interests of all shareholders.
Mr. Schulze stated that he was pleased that an agreement was reached which will allow him to conduct the due diligence he had sought.
The agreement, which will be filed with the SEC as part of Mr. Schulzes updated 13-D filing, provides the following:
If a transaction is proposed and the Board of Directors rejects such proposal, Mr. Schulze has agreed not to pursue an acquisition until January 2013.
However, if the first transaction proposal is rejected, Mr. Schulze would have the opportunity to present a second transaction proposal beginning in January 2013. The Board of Best Buy would have 30 days to review the second transaction proposal before Mr. Schulze would have the opportunity to take an offer directly to shareholders at the 2013 annual meeting or at a special meeting. If Mr. Schulze is unsuccessful in getting his offers approved by the Board or by the shareholders, then he has agreed not to pursue an acquisition until the expiration of the one year term of the agreement.
The Board has also committed to offer Mr. Schulze two Board seats, proportionate to his share ownership. If he presents a transaction proposal to shareholders or if he materially violates the standstill provisions of the cooperation agreement, he will no longer be allowed to obtain the two Board seats.
There is no guarantee that Mr. Schulze will be successful in arranging a potential offer, or that such an offer would be accepted by the Board of Directors.
