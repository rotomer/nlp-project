O
n August 31, 2012, Bes
t Buy Co., Inc. ("Best Buy" or the registrant) entered into a $1.0 billion 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (the 364-Day Facility Agreement) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JPMorgan) as administrative agent, and a syndicate of banks (collectively, the Lenders). The 364-Day Facility Agreement will replace the previous $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Previous Facility), with a syndicate of banks, including JPMorgan acting as administrative agent. The Previous Facility was originally scheduled to expire in October 2012. The 364-Day Facility Agreement permits borrowings up to $1.0 billion and terminates in August 2013 (subject to a one-year term-out option).
The interest rate under the 364-Day Facility Agreement is variable and is determined at the registrant's option as: (i) the sum of (a) the greatest of JPMorgan's prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, or the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 1%, and (b) a margin (the ABR Margin); or (ii) the LIBOR plus a margin (the LIBOR Margin). In addition, a facility fee is assessed on the commitment amount. The ABR Margin, LIBOR Margin and the facility fee are based upon the registrant's current senior unsecured debt rating. Under the 364-Day Facility Agreement, the ABR Margin ranges from 0.0% to 0.525%, the LIBOR Margin ranges from 0.925% to 1.525%, and the facility fee ranges from 0.075% to 0.225%.
The 364-Day Facility Agreement is guaranteed by specified subsidiaries of the registrant and contains customary affirmative and negative covenants. Among other things, these covenants restrict the registrant's or its subsidiaries' ability to incur certain types or amounts of indebtedness, incur liens on certain assets, make material changes in corporate structure or the nature of its business, dispose of material assets, engage in a change in control transaction, make certain foreign investments, enter into certain restrictive agreements, or engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The 364-Day Facility Agreement also contains covenants that require the registrant to maintain a maximum quarterly cash flow leverage ratio and a minimum quarterly interest coverage ratio. The 364-Day Facility Agreement contains customary default provisions including, but not limited to, failure to pay interest or principal when due and failure to comply with covenants.
Some of the Lenders and/or their affiliates have other business relationships with the registrant involving the provision of financial and banking-related services, including cash management, loans, foreign exchange contracts, letters of credit and bank guarantee facilities, investment banking and trust services.
The foregoing description of the 364-Day Facility Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the 364-Day Facility Agreement which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
(d) Exhibits.

If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.

provided
that no such notice shall be required in the case of any Event of Default under clause (h) or (i) of Article VII with respect to the Borrower), then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (A) no outstanding Syndicated Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing and (B) unless repaid, each Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be converted to a Syndicated ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period therefor.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, a Lender shall not be entitled to compensation pursuant to this Section in respect of any Competitive Loan if the Change in Law (other than any Change in Law referred to in the proviso of the definition of such term) that would otherwise entitle it to such compensation shall have been publicly announced prior to submission of the Competitive Bid pursuant to which such Loan was made.
SECTION 2.16.    
Break Funding Payments.
In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan or Fixed Rate Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period therefor (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Syndicated Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Syndicated Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice is permitted to be revocable under Section 2.11(b) and is revoked in accordance herewith), (d) the failure to borrow any Competitive Loan after accepting the Competitive Bid to make such Loan, or (e) the assignment as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19(b) of any Syndicated Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurocurrency Loan, the loss to any Lender attributable to any such event shall be deemed to include
21
an amount determined by such Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that such Lender would pay for a deposit equal to the principal amount of such Loan for the period from the date of such payment, conversion, failure or assignment to the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the duration of the Interest Period that would have resulted from such borrowing, conversion or continuation) if the interest rate payable on such deposit were equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate (in the case of a Syndicated Eurocurrency Loan) or the LIBO Rate (in the case of a Competitive Eurocurrency Loan) for such Interest Period,
over
(ii) the amount of interest that such Lender would earn on such principal amount for such period if such Lender were to invest such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that would be bid by such Lender (or an affiliate of such Lender) for deposits denominated in Dollars from other banks in the eurocurrency market at the commencement of such period. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
SECTION 2.17.    
Taxes.
(a)
Payments Free of Taxes.
Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes);
provided
that if the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor shall be required by applicable law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes (including any Other Taxes) from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor shall make or cause to be made such deductions and (iii) the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor shall timely pay or cause to be paid the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(b)
Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower.
Without limiting the provisions of paragraph (a) above, the Borrower and each Subsidiary Guarantor shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c)
Indemnification by the Borrower.
The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 30 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes, and Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts paid or payable under this Section, but excluding Excluded Taxes under all circumstances) paid or payable by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties and interest arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes) were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability, prepared in good faith and delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall not be obligated to indemnify for any Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes) if a written demand therefor is not made by the Administrative Agent or a Lender, as the case may be, within 120 days from the first date the Administrative Agent or such Lender knows or reasonably should have known of the imposition of such Taxes.
(d)
Evidence of Payments.
As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes) by the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e)
Indemnification by the Lenders.
Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for any Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors have not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors to do so) that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this paragraph (e) shall be paid within 10 days after the Administrative Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount of Taxes so paid or payable by the Administrative Agent. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error.
(f)
Foreign Lender Tax Certifications.
(i) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, any applicable withholding Tax with respect to any payments under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without, or at a reduced rate of, withholding. Upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, any Lender shall update any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this paragraph (f). If any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect with respect
22
to a Lender, such Lender shall promptly (and in any event within 10 days after such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy) notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy and update the form or certification if it is legally eligible to do so.
(ii)
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:
(A)
each Foreign Lender shall (x) furnish on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement either (1) two accurate and complete originally executed U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or successor form), (2) two accurate and complete originally executed U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or successor form), and/or (3) two accurate and complete originally executed U.S. Internal Service Form W-8IMY (together with the forms described in clauses (1) and (2), as required) certifying, in each case, to such Foreign Lender's legal entitlement to a complete exemption from U.S. Federal withholding tax with respect to all interest payments hereunder, and (y) provide a new Form W-8BEN (or successor form) or Form W-8ECI (or successor form) and/or Form W-8IMY (or successor form) upon the expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered form to reconfirm complete exemption from U.S. Federal withholding tax with respect to any interest payment hereunder to the extent (in case of this clause (y)) such Foreign Lender is legally able to do so;
provided
that any Foreign Lender that is relying on the so-called portfolio interest exemption and is not (x) a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (y) a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code and (z) a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code, shall also furnish a Non-Bank Certificate in the form of Exhibit C together with a Form W-8BEN. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.17(f)(ii)(A), a Foreign Lender that is an assignee shall not be required to deliver any documentation pursuant to this Section 2.17(f)(ii)(A) that such Foreign Lender is not legally able to deliver. For the avoidance of doubt, the legal inability of a Foreign Lender to provide any documentation pursuant to this Section 2.17(f)(ii)(A) shall not cause any Tax resulting from such inability to be an Excluded Tax in circumstances where such inability arises solely due to a Change in Law subsequent to the date the Foreign Lender becomes a party to this Agreement. Subject to Section 2.17(a), if any Foreign Lender fails to provide the certifications described in this paragraph, each such Foreign Lender acknowledges that the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold any Taxes imposed by the United States or any taxing authority thereof or therein, to the extent required by law.
(B)
If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Withholding Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent as may be necessary for the Withholding Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA and, as necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.17(f)(ii)(B), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(g)
U.S. Lender Tax Certifications.
Any Lender that is a United States person, as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code and is not an exempt recipient within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6049-4(c), shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Service Form W-9, or any successor form that such person is entitled to provide, establishing that the Lender is not subject to U.S. Federal backup withholding Tax.
(h)
Cooperation in Contesting Indemnified Taxes.
If the Borrower determines in good faith that a reasonable basis exists for contesting any Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes) for which additional amounts have been paid under this Section 2.17, the Administrative Agent or the relevant Lender, as the case may be, shall cooperate with the Borrower in challenging such Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes) at the Borrower's expense, if so requested by the Borrower in writing;
provided
that, in the sole discretion, exercised in good faith, of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, doing so would not materially prejudice the Administrative Agent or such Lender, and the Administrative Agent or such Lender would not be required to disclose any information it considers proprietary or make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
(i)
Treatment of Certain Refunds.
If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes) as to which it has been indemnified by
23
the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor or with respect to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor under this Section with respect to the Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes) giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund);
provided
that the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, shall repay the amount paid over to the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to disclose any information it considers proprietary or make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any other Person.
SECTION 2.18.    
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs.
(a)
Payments by the Obligors.
Each Obligor shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest or fees, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise), or under any other Loan Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein), prior to 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Account, except as otherwise expressly provided in the relevant Loan Document and except payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03, which shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments under each Loan Document shall be made in Dollars.
(b)
Application of Insufficient Payments.
If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.
(c)
Pro Rata Treatment.
Except to the extent otherwise provided herein (for the avoidance of doubt, as this Agreement is in effect from time to time): (i) each payment of facility fees under Section 2.12(a) shall be made for account of the Lenders, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments under Section 2.09 shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments (or, in the case of any such payment of facility fees at a time when the Commitments shall have terminated or expired, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Revolving Credit Exposure); (ii) each Syndicated Borrowing shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders according to the amounts of their respective Commitments (in the case of the making of Syndicated Loans) or their respective Loans that are to be included in such Borrowing (in the case of conversions and continuations of Loans); (iii) each payment or prepayment of any Syndicated Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the repaid or prepaid Syndicated Borrowing; and (iv) if the Term-Out Option is exercised, the payment of the term-out fees under Section 2.12(c) shall be made for account of the Lenders pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments immediately prior to the Commitment Termination Date.
(d)
Sharing of Payments by Lenders.
If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans (other than a Competitive Loan) resulting in such Lender's receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans (other than Competitive Loans) and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (A) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact and (B) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans (other than Competitive Loans) of other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amounts of principal of and accrued interest on their Loans (other than Competitive Loans),
provided
that:
(i)
if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and
24
(ii)
the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by any Obligor pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, as this Agreement is in effect from time to time) or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).
Each Obligor consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each Obligor rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of each Obligor in the amount of such participation.
(e)
Payments by the Borrower; Presumptions by the Administrative Agent.
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
(f)
Certain Deductions by the Administrative Agent.
If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it hereunder to or for the account of the Administrative Agent, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations in respect of such payment until all such unsatisfied obligations have been discharged or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender pursuant to this Agreement (including pursuant to Sections 2.07(b), 2.18(e) and 10.03(c)), in each case in such order as shall be determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
SECTION 2.19.    
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a)
Designation of a Different Lending Office.
If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or requires the Borrower to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign and delegate its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment and delegation (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment and delegation.
(b)
Replacement of Lenders.
If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, (ii) the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, (iii)  any Lender has become a Defaulting Lender, or (iv) any Lender does not consent to any proposed amendment, supplement, modification, consent or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that requires the consent of such Lender or each of the Lenders or each of the Lenders affected thereby (so long as the consent of the Required Lenders has been obtained), then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.04), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents (other than any outstanding Competitive Loans held by it) to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment),
provided
that:
(A)
the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld;
(B)
the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 10.04;
(C)
such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans (other than Competitive Loans), accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts (except Competitive Loans) payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 2.16) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
(D)
in the case of any such assignment and delegation resulting from a claim for compensation under
25
Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment and delegation will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and
(E)
such assignment does not conflict with applicable law.
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Each party hereto agrees that an assignment and delegation required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and that the Lender required to make such assignment and delegation need not be a party thereto.
SECTION 2.20.    
Defaulting Lenders
. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
(a)
facility fees shall continue to accrue on the amount of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(a) only to the extent of the Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender; and
(b)
the Commitment, the Revolving Credit Exposure and the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Competitive Loans of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders or any other requisite Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 10.02);
provided
that any amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or all Lenders affected thereby shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.02, require the consent of such Defaulting Lender in accordance with the terms hereof.
In the event that the Administrative Agent and the Borrower each agree that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Syndicated Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.
SECTION 2.21.    
Term-Out Option
. The Borrower may, by irrevocable written notice to the Administrative Agent given, not less than 30 days, but not more than 60 days, prior to the Commitment Termination Date, elect (such election, the 
Term-Out Option
) to extend the Maturity Date to a one-year anniversary of the Commitment Termination Date;
provided
that on the Commitment Termination Date (a) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom, (b) the representations and warranties set forth in Article IV and in the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct on and as of the Commitment Termination Date as if made on and as of such date (or, if any such representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of a specific date, as of such specific date) and (c) the Borrower shall pay the Term-Out Fee to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(c). Each notice by the Borrower under this Section shall be deemed to constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower as to the matters specified in clauses (a) and (b) above as of the Commitment Termination Date. For the avoidance of doubt all Commitments will terminate on the Commitment Termination Date, and no additional Borrowings will be permitted after the Commitment Termination Date. This Section shall not apply to Competitive Loans, which must be repaid on or prior to the Commitment Termination Date.
ARTICLE II
Guarantee
SECTION 3.01.    
The Guarantee.
The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby jointly and severally, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, guarantee to each Lender, each other holder of a Guaranteed Obligation (as hereinafter defined) and the Administrative Agent and their respective successors and assigns the prompt payment in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the principal of and interest on the Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrower and all fees, indemnification payments and other amounts whatsoever, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, now or hereafter from time to time owing to the Lenders or the Administrative Agent by the Borrower under this Agreement and by any Obligor under any of the other Loan Documents, in each case strictly in accordance with the terms thereof and including all interest, fees and expenses accrued or incurred subsequent to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings with respect to the Borrower, whether or not such interest, fees or expenses are allowed as a claim in such proceeding (such obligations being herein collectively called the 
Guaranteed Obligations
). The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby further jointly and severally agree that if the Borrower shall fail to pay in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Subsidiary Guarantors will promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when
26
due (whether at extended maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal.
SECTION 3.02.    
Obligations Unconditional.
The obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under Section 3.01 are absolute and unconditional, joint and several, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein, or any substitution, release or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor, it being the intent of this Section that the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional, joint and several, under any and all circumstances. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that the occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not alter or impair the liability of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder, which shall remain absolute and unconditional as described above:
(i)
at any time or from time to time, without notice to the Subsidiary Guarantors, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or compliance shall be waived;
(ii)
any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein shall be done or omitted;
(iii)
the maturity of any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be accelerated, or any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be modified, supplemented or amended in any respect, or any right under this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein shall be waived or any other guarantee of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security therefor shall be released or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with; or
(iv)
any lien or security interest granted to, or in favor of, the Administrative Agent or any Lender or Lenders as security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall fail to be perfected.
The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby expressly waive diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all notices whatsoever. Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that its guarantee hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and hereby expressly waives any requirement that the Administrative Agent or any Lender exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against the Borrower under this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein, or against any other Person under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Guaranteed Obligations.
SECTION 3.03.    
Reinstatement.
The obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under this Article shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and the Subsidiary Guarantors jointly and severally agree that they will indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including fees of counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.
SECTION 3.04.    
Subrogation.
The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby jointly and severally agree that until the payment and satisfaction in full of all Guaranteed Obligations and the expiration and termination of the Commitments of the Lenders under this Agreement they shall not exercise any right or remedy arising by reason of any performance by them of their guarantee in Section 3.01, whether by subrogation or otherwise, against the Borrower or any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations.
SECTION 3.05.    
Remedies.
The Subsidiary Guarantors jointly and severally agree that, as between the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Lenders, the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in Article VIII (and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in Article VIII) for purposes of Section 3.01 notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or such obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against the Borrower and that, in the event of such declaration (or such obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), such obligations (whether or not due and payable by the Borrower) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Subsidiary Guarantors for purposes of Section 3.01.
27
SECTION 3.06.    
Instrument for the Payment of Money
.
To the fullest extent permitted by N.Y. Civ. Prac. L&R  3213 and other applicable law, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby acknowledges that the guarantee in this Article constitutes an instrument for the payment of money, and consents and agrees that any Lender or the Administrative Agent, at its sole option, in the event of a dispute by such Subsidiary Guarantor in the payment of any moneys due hereunder, shall have the right to bring motion action under N.Y. Civ. Prac. L&R  3213.
SECTION 3.07.    
Continuing Guarantee.
The guarantee in this Article is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Guaranteed Obligations whenever arising. Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, or amended or modified, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any extension, renewal, amendment or modification of any Guaranteed Obligation.

Administrative Agent.
Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the entity named as Administrative Agent in the heading of this Agreement and its successors to serve as Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and neither the Borrower nor any other Obligor shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of such provisions.
The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:
(a)
shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;
(b)
shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is
38
required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02);
provided
that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or be contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law; and
(c)
shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct (with such absence to be presumed unless otherwise determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and nonappealable judgment). The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice describing such Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender.
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (a) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (b) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (c) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document or the occurrence of any Default, (d) the sufficiency, validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (e) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article V or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not have any liability arising from any confirmation of the Revolving Credit Exposure or the component amounts thereof.
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for an Obligor), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more subagents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such subagent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such subagent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such subagent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, or required if an Event of Default under clauses (a), (b), (h) or (i) of Article VIII has occurred and is continuing), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States of America, or an Affiliate of any such bank. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above
provided
that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (a) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (b) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this paragraph. Upon the acceptance of a successor's appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if
39
not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its subagents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any other Lender or any Arranger or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any other Lender or any other Arranger or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
Except as otherwise provided in Section 10.02(b) with respect to this Agreement, the Administrative Agent may, with the prior consent of the Required Lenders (but not otherwise), consent to any modification, supplement or waiver under any of the Loan Documents.

provided
that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;

Participations.
(i)
Participations Generally.
Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a 
Participant
) in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it);
provided
that (A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 10.02(b) that directly and adversely affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Sections 2.17(f) and 2.17(g) (it being understood that the documentation required under Sections 2.17(f) and 2.17(g) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender,
provided
that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(d) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender selling participations shall keep a register (the 
Participant Register
) in which it shall record the name and address of each Participant to which such Lender sells participations and the amount and terms of such participations, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower;
provided
that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant's interest in any Commitments, Loans or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
(ii)
Limitations on Rights of Participants.
A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.17(f) as though it were a Lender.
44

Certain Pledges.
Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;
provided
that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17, 2.18(f), 3.03 and 10.03 and Article IX shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

SECTION 10.07.    
Severability.

SECTION 10.08.

provided
that if any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. Each Lender (including any Defaulting Lender) agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such application made by such Lender,
