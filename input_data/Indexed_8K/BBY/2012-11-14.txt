Carphone Warehouse Group plc
Interim results for the 6 months ended 30 September 2012
Encouraging H1 performance, return to LFL growth
CPW Europe (50% joint venture)
Virgin Mobile France (46% joint venture)
A reconciliation of Headline results to statutory results is provided in note 4 to the financial review.
Roger Taylor, CEO said:
We have delivered a good performance in a dynamic mobile market, with sales benefitting from our renewed focus and specific investment initiatives. As a result, we have substantially increased our market share of UK postpay volumes and, while the prepay market remains weak, we hope for an improvement in the second half as the product pipeline continues to broaden. In Continental Europe, we have also been exploring growth opportunities for the business through potentially long-term strategic partnerships. Virgin Mobile France has grown its revenue and postpay customer base, despite intense competition, and is starting to benefit as it moves its customers onto its Full MVNO infrastructure.
Looking ahead, we reiterate our full year guidance, we continue to focus on operational execution across the business and we remain well-placed to benefit from a strong product cycle.
Exhibit 99.1
Overview
The Group has worked hard on a number of initiatives over the past 6 months.
In our core business we have continued to drive postpay volumes with substantial market share gains in the UK, through our weekly 'Smart Deals' and key product launches. Postpay connections for the Group grew in H1 (with a particularly strong performance in Q2). Volume gains have been driven by investment in the proposition and this supports our strategy of long-term value creation through increasing scale. Although the prepay market remains weak (down 30-40% over the past 12 months), we expect an improvement in prepay for the second half of the year as the product pipeline continues to broaden. Total connections for the Group were down 11.5% in H1, affected by weak prepay, with the decline in connections abating in Q2 (down 5.6%) as compared with Q1 (down 17.8%).
As important as the product pipeline is to our performance, our in-store operational execution is imperative and here too we have been making significant progress.
By Christmas we will have c.280 Wireless World stores in the UK and key elements of the Wireless World format in the remaining 500 UK stores. Customer satisfaction scores are at an all-time high proving that the look and feel of our stores and the in-store service are resonating well with our customers.
We have also made significant progress with the reorganisation of CPW Europe in order to reshape the business and focus on our core proposition. Following the creation of an autonomous UK and Ireland business and standalone European markets, group functions have been reduced, resulting in considerable cost savings.
Virgin Mobile France grew revenue and its postpay customer base during the period despite intense competition. The business continues to transfer customers to its Full MVNO infrastructure with over 300,000 customers on this platform at the end of September.
Outlook
In CPW Europe we are encouraged by our market share gains and strong like-for-like performance in the first half and we reiterate guidance for the full year of 130m - 150m Headline EBIT as we continue to invest in the proposition and build on the momentum we are already seeing within the business.
While the industry and economic environment remain challenging, we have reasons to be optimistic. The product pipeline in postpay continues to excite consumers as smartphone technology further evolves, with good visibility now of 4G development across Europe. We are also hopeful of higher penetration of smartphones into the prepay category this Christmas as the range broadens and prices become more attractive.
CPW Europe is undergoing a restructuring process, mentioned above. We expect the reorganisation to bring significant benefits with annualised pre-tax savings of between 20m and 25m. The programme is expected to give rise to exceptional charges in the second half of the financial year, with provisional estimates of one-off pre-tax cash costs of between 20m and 25m, together with asset write-downs of between 5m and 10m, both of which will be excluded from Headline earnings.
In Europe we have been exploring growth opportunities for the business through partnerships. We have a number of trial stores running with potential partners and we are pleased with the performance of these stores so far. We will continue to explore these opportunities to gain scale in a number of our mainland European markets.
Virgin Mobile France's migration to Full MVNO continues to go well, providing the opportunity to enhance revenue, reduce costs and provide a more flexible strategic platform.

Exhibit 99.1
Performance review
CPW Europe
(50% stake)
Headline income statement (100% basis) *
* Prior year Headline results have been restated to exclude the results of businesses which have been discontinued. For further details see notes 4 and 6 to the financial review.
CPW Europe generated revenues of 1,660.0m, an increase of 8.0% year-on-year (2011: 1,537.6m). This growth was principally driven by our dealer business which helped to offset an adverse movement on foreign exchange and the absence of revenues from Phone House Belgium, which was sold in the second half of last year.
Revenues also benefitted from like-for-like growth of 1.6% in the first half, with the second quarter particularly strong at 5.0%, driven primarily by significant postpay growth in our UK business. Continuing the pattern seen in the second half of last year, increasingly attractive consumer propositions drove year-on-year growth in high-end smartphones, resulting in higher revenue per connection. Alongside this, the UK business' successful 'Smart Deal' promotions drove volume in the low-tier postpay segment.
As anticipated, the prepay market remained subdued during the first half of the year, reflecting reduced subsidies from network operators following regulatory cuts to mobile termination rates in 2011. We continue to expect increasingly attractive prepay smartphone propositions to come to market, and hope that this will reinvigorate this segment in the second half of the year.
As a result of continued weakness in the prepay segment, connection volumes dropped year-on-year by 11.5% from 5.0m to 4.4m.
CPW Europe opened or re-sited 69 stores and closed the same number, ending the period at 2,393 stores, the same number as at the beginning of the year. Within this portfolio, the number of franchise stores increased from 338 at March 2012 to 346 at the end of the period, primarily reflecting growth in France and Spain.
Exhibit 99.1
CPW Europe's gross margin percentage decreased by 370 basis points year-on-year to 25.2% (2011: 28.9%). The majority of this reduction reflects the increased low margin dealer activity, with gross margins on the core business down by approximately 180 basis points. This principally reflects a year-on-year increase in the proportion of high value smartphones, which have a lower gross margin percentage than lower value postpay, and a continuation of the pressure on gross margins in this category seen in the second half of last year. As we start to annualise against these patterns, we do not expect this reduction to be repeated in the second half of the year.
 
Operating expenses decreased by 4.1% year-on-year to 365.6m (2011: 381.2m) largely reflecting the effects of a weaker Euro and the absence of operating expenses from Phone House Belgium.
CPW Europe's Headline EBIT decreased from 20.0m to 12.5m, slightly better than expected and principally reflecting the year-on-year deterioration in the prepay market.
The interest charge for the period was 4.7m (2011: 10.0m). The prior period includes the write-off of facility fees relating to a receivables financing arrangement, which was replaced by a new revolving credit facility in July 2011. The reduction in the underlying interest charge year-on-year largely reflects lower margins payable under the new facility, together with lower underlying interest rates.
CPW Europe had an effective tax rate of 21.5% (2011: 29.0%). We expect the full year effective rate to be broadly in line with the rate in the first half, slightly higher than last year's full year rate of 18.5%, which reflected the resolution of various uncertainties during the year.
During the first half, CPW Europe undertook a review of its UK and Group organisational structure, with a view to simplifying group functions and giving more autonomy and accountability to individual business units. As a result of this exercise, we expect redundancy and other restructuring costs in the second half of the year.
CPW Europe is also reviewing its European operations and has announced plans to reduce its store portfolio and operating cost base in France, given the challenging mobile market conditions there. The current intention is to exit approximately 80 stores, subject to consultation with employee representatives.
Our provisional estimate is that these restructuring programmes will result in one-off pre-tax cash costs of between 20m and 25m, together with asset write-downs of between 5m and 10m, both of which will be excluded from Headline earnings. We expect these programmes to provide annualised pre-tax savings of between 20m and 25m.
Cash flow (100% basis)
Headline EBITDA reduced year-on-year to 52.5m (2011: 63.2m) for the reasons described above.
Exhibit 99.1
The business saw the usual seasonal working capital outflow in the first half. The absorption of working capital was 91.1m in the period, down from 134.7m in the first half of last year, reflecting the first impact of newly negotiated payment structures with the network operators. We expect the benefit of these terms to build in the second half and continue to target a working capital inflow of over 100m for the full year.
Capex spend reduced to 36.7m (2011: 44.2m) principally reflecting fewer store openings during the period.
Cash outflows associated with Best Buy UK were 22.2m, predominantly reflecting property exit costs, the charge for which was booked during 2011-12. We expect further cash outflows in the region of 25m in the second half, as the remaining leases are assigned.
Other cash flows reflect interest and tax payments, and the settlement of incentive plans associated with Best Buy Mobile, the cost of which was booked during 2011-12.
 
At the end of the period, CPW Europe had net debt of 141.1m, up from 29.4m at the start of the period, reflecting the cash flows described above.
Virgin Mobile France
(46.3% stake)
Headline income statement (100% basis) *
* See note 6 to the financial review.
Virgin Mobile France revenue was broadly flat year-on-year on an actual currency basis at 191.7m (2011: 193.0m) reflecting underlying revenue growth offset by a weakening of the Euro year-on-year. Revenue at a constant currency was up by 9.2%, driven by continued growth in the postpay base and by mobile termination revenue, which was earned for the first time towards the end of the prior year. These factors helped to offset the effects of downward pressure on outbound ARPU caused by a highly competitive market.
While the total customer base was down year-on-year at 1.88m customers (2011: 2.01m) the postpay base, which is of significantly higher value, increased by 6.9% year-on-year to 1.42m (2011: 1.33m) and by 80,000 since March 2012. The business continues to perform strongly despite intense market competition, maintaining its focus on innovative propositions and high quality customer service to provide differentiation.
Virgin Mobile France has deliberately reduced focus on the low value prepay market, in which there is less visibility of returns on investment.
The level of investment in Virgin's quad-play proposition has been modest in the first half. The proposition remains in its infancy and has to date principally been used as a retention tool, although it provides the business with opportunities to develop its customer reach.
Exhibit 99.1
During the period the business continued to develop its Full MVNO infrastructure, which enables it to participate more fully in customer revenue streams, including termination revenues, and to reduce its operating costs. At the end of September over 300,000 customers were on this platform and the business remains on track to hit its target of 50% of customers on the Full MVNO by March 2013.
The business produced a Headline EBIT margin of 4.2% (2011: 4.1%) with an improved EBITDA margin offsetting the effect of increased depreciation and amortisation on the Full MVNO infrastructure.
Interest decreased year-on-year from 1.5m to 0.8m, reflecting lower average debt following loan repayments over the last 18 months.
The tax charge increased to 2.6m (2011: 2.2m) primarily reflecting the higher level of earnings described above.
Virgin Mobile France recorded amortisation on acquisition intangibles arising on the acquisition of Tele2 France, of which the Group's post-tax share is 0.3m (2011: 0.9m). This charge is excluded from Headline results to avoid distortion of underlying performance.
Cash flow (100% basis)
* Comprises shareholder loans of 44.0m (2011: 57.2m) and net cash of 9.9m (2011: 4.9m).
EBITDA increased from 9.8m to 11.5m for the reasons described above. Capex increased year-on-year to 12.2m (2011: 5.9m) reflecting capex relating to the Full MVNO deferred from last year.
The business recorded a working capital inflow of 8.7m (2011: 7.2m) reflecting timing differences around the end of the period.
Other cash flows reflect interest and tax payments and the impact of foreign exchange.
Exhibit 99.1
Other Group financials
Headline income statement
Revenue increased to 5.4m (2011: 2.8m) reflecting consultancy income associated with the disposal of the Group's interest in Best Buy Mobile. Operating expenses were 3.3m (2011: 3.0m) with the increase primarily reflecting incremental investment in Global Connect.
Net interest income for the period decreased to 1.2m (2011: 1.3m) principally reflecting a reduction in loans to Virgin Mobile France.
A tax charge of 1.2m arose in the period (2011: 0.7m) increasing in line with pre-tax profitability from wholly-owned operations.
Exhibit 99.1
Statutory results
Discontinued businesses within CPW Europe represent Best Buy Mobile and Best Buy UK, which were respectively disposed of and closed last year. The results of these businesses have been excluded from Headline results in order to provide visibility of the performance of the continuing business.
The Group's post-tax share of amortisation of acquisition intangibles in Virgin Mobile France was 0.3m (2011: 0.9m). This charge is excluded from Headline results to avoid distortion of underlying performance.
A reconciliation between Headline results and statutory results is provided in note 4 to the financial review.
Net funds and dividends
The Group closed the period with net funds of 81.0m, down from 102.7m at March 2012, and loans receivable from Virgin Mobile France of 21.2m, down from 24.3m at March 2012. Cash outflows during the period reflect distributions to shareholders of 48.3m, partially offset by the settlement of receivables, primarily from CPW Europe.
The Board has declared an interim dividend of 1.75p per share, in line with last year's interim distribution. The ex-dividend date is Wednesday 21 November 2012, with a record date of Friday 23 November 2012 and an intended payment date of Friday 14 December 2012.

1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies
General information
A copy of the Carphone Warehouse Group plc annual report for the year ended 31 March 2012 (Annual Report) can be found on the Group's website www.cpwplc.com and a copy has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the Group's auditors was unqualified, did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis and did not contain a statement under section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006. The information included in this document for the year ended 31 March 2012 does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements for the 6 months ended 30 September 2012 and the 6 months ended 30 September 2011 have not been subject to audit or review by the Group's auditors.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with IFRS. The condensed financial statements included in this half year report have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting'.
Going concern
At 30 September 2012 the Group had cash and cash equivalents of 81.0m (September 2011: 97.1m, March 2012: 102.7m).
The directors have reviewed the future cash and profit forecasts of the Group's joint venture investments and other businesses, which they consider to be based on prudent assumptions. The directors are of the opinion that the forecasts, which reflect both the current uncertain economic outlook and reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that these businesses and the Group should be able to operate within their facilities and comply with their banking covenants. In arriving at this conclusion the directors were mindful that the Group has significant cash and cash equivalents.
Accordingly the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future and consequently the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in the preparation of the financial statements.
Accounting policies
These interim condensed financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies and methods of computation consistent with those set out on pages 55 to 60 of the Annual Report, along with the definitions that are set out on page 85 of the same document.
Exhibit 99.1
2 Segmental reporting
Segmental results are analysed as follows:
Exhibit 99.1
3 Equity dividends
The following dividends and distributions were paid during the period:
The interim dividend for the year ending 31 March 2013 is 1.75p per share at an expected cost of 8.3m.
4 Reconciliation of Headline results to statutory results
Exhibit 99.1
Headline results are shown before exceptional items, the results of businesses which have been discontinued by the Group's joint ventures, and amortisation of acquisition intangibles. Non-Headline items in the year ended 31 March 2012 predominantly relate to the disposal of Best Buy Mobile and the closure of Best Buy UK. Full details can be found in note 4 to the Annual Report. Headline information is provided because the directors consider that it provides assistance in understanding underlying performance.
5 Earnings per share
Dilution in prior periods relates to incentive schemes which vested in the prior year.
Dilution in the current period relates to an incentive scheme for senior Best Buy Europe employees, the Group's obligations for which are expected to be met using the Company's shares. Under the scheme, participants have the opportunity to share in earnings in excess of minimum growth targets, against the year ended 31 March 2009.
A minimum value of the pool was agreed in the year ended 31 March 2012, in recognition of the value that had already accrued in the scheme in relation to Best Buy Mobile, which was disposed of in January 2012. The dilution reflected in the current period relates to this minimum value.
The incentive scheme has a performance period to March 2015 and vests during 2015. The scheme is not yet considered to be dilutive beyond the minimum pool value, since incremental relevant earnings to date do not exceed the total return required over the performance period. However, based on relevant earnings in the three years ended 31 March 2012 and the minimum rate of return over the same period, the additional dilution that would have arisen if the scheme had vested at that date would have been 3.1m shares.
Exhibit 99.1
6 Interests in joint ventures
Interests in joint ventures are as follows:
The Group's interest in Virgin Mobile France reduced from 46.6% to 46.3% during the period, following the exercise of share options by management of Virgin Mobile France. In addition to share options, management hold warrants that give them the right to acquire new shares at a price based on the value of existing shareholder funding and an additional amount which increases with the quantity of shares being acquired. The maximum potential dilution to the Group's stake if all existing share options and warrants were exercised is approximately 5.5%, although the value of this dilution would be partially offset by cash inflows in relation to the proceeds on exercise.
The Group's interests in joint ventures are analysed as follows:
Exhibit 99.1
At the start of the prior period, Best Buy Europe had a 350m receivables financing arrangement provided by a number of banks. This facility was supplemented by a revolving credit facility of 125m provided equally by the Company and Best Buy, and letters of support through which both companies were committed to providing further funding to a maximum of 50m each.
In July 2011, Best Buy Europe secured a new 400m revolving credit facility from its core bank group. This facility matures in July 2015. Following this refinancing, the receivables financing arrangement, the shareholder revolving credit facility and the letters of support were cancelled.
Loans are provided to Virgin Mobile France under a shareholder agreement; funding requirements are agreed between the shareholders on a regular basis and are provided in proportion to each party's shareholding.
The Group's share of the results of its joint ventures is as follows:
* Headline EBITDA includes the unwinding of discounts for the time value of money on network commissions receivable over the life of the customer. This unwind has a value of 4.4m in the 6 months ended 30 September 2012 (September 2011: 4.5m; March 2012: 8.7m) and is treated as interest income in the joint venture's statutory results.
Exhibit 99.1
* Revenue excludes contributions towards subscriber acquisition costs from network operators and customers, as the directors
consider that this provides a better representation of underlying performance. These items, which had a value of 29.8m in the 6 months ended 30 September 2012 (September 2011: 29.9m; March 2012: 71.0m) are netted off against acquisition costs within EBITDA. Reported revenue on a statutory basis for the 6 months ended 30 September 2012 is 221.5m (September 2011: 222.9m; March 2012: 461.2m).
** Virgin Mobile France have commitments in place to purchase an agreed amount of wholesale capacity at preferential rates from network operators in return for a fixed fee. The fixed fee has been recognised as a non-current asset and will be amortised over the period of the commitment. The amortisation of this asset is recognised as a cost of sales within Headline EBITDA in line with other network-related expenses. The amortisation has a value of 8.1m in the period ended 30 September 2012 (September 2011: nil; March 2012: 4.2m) and is treated as amortisation in the joint venture's statutory results.
The Group's share of the assets and liabilities of its joint ventures is as follows:
