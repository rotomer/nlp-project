On December 14, 2012, simultaneously with the execution of the Letter Agreement (as further described in Item 8.01 below), the Board of Directors of Best Buy Co., Inc. (Best Buy or the registrant or the Company) duly adopted a resolution to amend Article II, Section 9(B) of the Company's Amended and Restated By-Laws (the Bylaw Amendment). Pursuant to the Bylaw Amendment, for business, including director nominations, to be properly brought before the Company's 2013 regular meeting of shareholders by a shareholder, a shareholder must submit notice to the Secretary of the Company no earlier than February 15, 2013 and no later than March 15, 2013 (as opposed to no more than 150 days and no less than 120 days before the anniversary of the prior year's regular meeting of shareholders). The Bylaw Amendment was effective immediately upon approval.
The foregoing summary of the amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended and Restated Bylaws, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
On December 14, 2012, the Company issued a news release announcing that the Company and Mr. Schulze entered into a letter agreement (the Letter Agreement) amending the confidentiality agreement, dated August 26, 2012, between Mr. Schulze and the Company (the Confidentiality Agreement).
The news release issued on December 14, 2012 is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to liability of that Section unless the registrant specifically incorporates it by reference in a document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
On December 14, 2012, the Company and Mr. Schulze entered into the Letter Agreement amending the Confidentiality Agreement to, among other things, (i) allow Mr. Schulze to provide the Company with a Qualified Offer (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) on or after February 1, 2013 through February 28, 2013 and (ii) effect a corresponding extension of the Standstill Period (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) from August 26, 2013 to October 31, 2013.
In connection with entering into the Letter Agreement, the registrant granted Mr. Schulze a limited waiver of Minnesota law in order to allow Mr. Schulze to work with his private equity partners to develop a definitive proposal to be presented to the registrant's Board.
    
The foregoing description of the principal terms of the Letter Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Letter Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated by reference herein.
The registrant's Annual Report to Shareholders and its reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K and other publicly available information should be consulted for other important information about the registrant.

Dear Mr. Schulze:
Reference is made to the letter agreement (the 
Agreement
), dated August 26, 2012, between Richard M. Schulze (
you
) and Best Buy Co., Inc., a Minnesota corporation (the 
Company
).
As used in this Agreement, 
Standstill Period
 means the period from the date of this Agreement through October 31, 2013;
provided
,
however
, that
(i)    on or after February 1, 2013 through February 28, 2013 (such date, the 
Proposal Deadline
, and such period, the 
Proposal Period
), you and your affiliates may provide the Company with a Qualified Offer. Neither you nor the Company shall be under any obligation to enter into negotiations with respect to such Qualified Offer. Only after thirty days from the date on which you submit such Qualified Offer to the Company (or shorter period if the Company indicates in writing that it is not interested in negotiating such Qualified Offer), may you publicly seek to obtain shareholder approval, support or endorsement of the Qualified Offer, which approval, support or endorsement shall include, but not be limited to, seeking to change the composition of the Board of Directors through the solicitation of proxies for such purpose at the 2013 Annual Meeting or a special meeting of the Company's shareholders (and in furtherance of the foregoing, you may seek to call a special meeting of the Company's shareholders pursuant to the terms of the By-Laws of the Company, including by the solicitation of consents to call a special meeting) and in each case you may vote or consent;
provided
, that such proxy statement must state that if the slate of directors you are proposing are elected to the Board of Directors, then you expect that such newly constituted Board of Directors will, subject to their fiduciary duties, consider the Qualified Offer. In connection with any such solicitation, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent you from issuing statements advocating the merits of your plans and proposals, so long as such statements are factually accurate. The Company agrees that during the Standstill Period it will not propose or implement any changes to the Company's Amended and Restated By-Laws or Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation that would change, revise or amend in any way the manner in which a special or regular meeting of shareholders may be called or conducted.
(ii)    at any time following the execution of this amendment to the Agreement unless you have (i) sought to obtain shareholder approval, support or endorsement of the Qualified Offer (as further described in Section 2(c)(i) above) or (ii) materially violated the terms of this Section 2, the Company shall, promptly upon your prior written request, take all necessary action to cause to be elected to the Board of Directors that number of your nominees (chosen from a list of nominees provided by you (all such nominees shall satisfy the director qualification standards set forth on the Company's website on the date hereof by the Company's Nominating, Corporate Governance and Public Policy Committee (and disregarding any additional director search criteria that may be set forth on the Company's website) and a majority of such nominees shall meet the definition of independence as defined by the New York Stock Exchange and Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is one greater than the number of nominees to be elected), so long as you own, inclusive of family trusts in which you may not have beneficial ownership, not less than 20% of the Company, equal to the greater of (A) two and (B) the number of Board members that is proportional (after giving effect to any increase in the size of the Board as contemplated by this Section 2(c)(ii)) to your percentage ownership in the Company (provided that fractions of .5 or higher shall be rounded up to the next whole number);
provided
,
however
, that in connection with the election of your nominees as provided in this Section 2(c)(ii), the Company may increase the number of directors on the Company's Board of Directors by the number of your nominees elected to the Board. For the avoidance of doubt, upon providing your written notice to cause your nominees to be elected to the Board of Directors, you will no longer be entitled to take the actions specified in Section 2(c)(i) of this Agreement.
Exhibit 10.1
The Company represents that simultaneous with the execution of the amendment to this Agreement (i) the Board of Directors duly adopted the Resolutions of the Board of Directors and (ii) the Committee of Disinterested Directors duly adopted the Resolutions of the Committee of Disinterested Directors, a copy of each of which has been provided to you in connection with your execution of the amendment to this Agreement.

Exhibit 99.1
Best Buy Board and Founder Richard Schulze Agree to Amend August 26th Cooperation Agreement
MINNEAPOLIS - Dec. 14, 2012 -- Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE: BBY) and founder Richard Schulze today announced that they have agreed to amend the terms of their August 26, 2012 agreement that allowed Mr. Schulze access to certain due diligence information and permission to form an investment group in furtherance of making a fully financed proposal with respect to a Qualified Offer (as defined in the agreement).
Both parties believe that allowing Mr. Schulze to bring his offer after the holiday season and fiscal year end is in the best interests of shareholders and provides Mr. Schulze and his potential partners with an opportunity to include the Company's full year results as part of their due diligence review. Accordingly, Best Buy and Mr. Schulze have mutually agreed that Mr. Schulze will have the opportunity to deliver the proposal to the Board of Directors on or after February 1, 2013 through February 28, 2013. The Board would, within 30 days, review and take a position on any such offer, consistent with its fiduciary duties and in the best interests of shareholders. There is no guarantee that Mr. Schulze will present an offer, or that such an offer would be accepted by the Board of Directors.
