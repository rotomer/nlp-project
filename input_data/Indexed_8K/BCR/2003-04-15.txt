ITEM 9. Regulation FD Disclosure (Information provided under Item 12 - Results of Operations and Financial Condition).
The following information is disclosed pursuant to Item 12 - Results of Operations and Financial Condition. It is being furnished under Item 9 of this Form 8-K in accordance with interim guidance issued by the SEC in release No. 33-8216.
On April 15, 2003, C. R. Bard, Inc. issued a press release reporting earnings and other financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2003. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.
The press release referenced above compares the company's consolidated net sales and the company's net sales outside the United States for the first quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2002 on both a reported basis and a constant currency basis. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company's management believes the exclusion of these effects results in an additional meaningful comparison of net sales between the two periods. The press release also compares net income and diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2002 on a reported basis and excluding certain specifically identified items. Because of the unusual nature of these items, the company's management believes that excluding them provides investors with meaningful information about the comparability of the company's results of operations between the two periods.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
C. R. BARD, INC.
