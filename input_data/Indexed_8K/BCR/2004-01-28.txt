For the fourth quarter 2003, net income was $20.6 million and diluted earnings per share were 39 cents, both down 56 percent over the same period in the prior year. Included in these results were certain unusual items that reduced net income by $35.2 million (after tax), or 67 cents per diluted share, thereby affecting comparability with the prior-year quarter. This includes a charge of $35.5 million (after tax) related to a previously announced legal verdict. Excluding these unusual items, net income was $55.8 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.06 in the fourth quarter of 2003, an increase of 20 percent and 19 percent, respectively, over the same period in the prior year.
Net sales for the full year 2003 were $1,433.1 million, an increase of 13 percent over the prior-year period. On a constant currency basis, full year 2003 net sales increased 9 percent. Full year 2003 net sales in the U.S. were $1,020.4 million, up 10 percent over the prior-year period. Net sales outside the U.S. were $412.7 million, up 20 percent over the prior-year period.

For the full year 2002, Bard reported net income of $155.0 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.94. Included in these results were unusual items reducing net income by $21.7 million (after tax), or 41 cents per diluted share, related to the termination of the proposed merger with Tyco International Ltd., the realignment and consolidation of certain divisional and manufacturing operations and corporate severance costs, offset in part by the reversal of certain legal accruals and a tax credit. Excluding the impact of these unusual items in 2002 and the unusual items identified above for 2003, net income and diluted earnings per share in 2003 grew 15 percent and 16 percent, respectively, as compared to the prior year.

The significant improvements in our gross margin continue to provide us with the means to fund these initiatives.
