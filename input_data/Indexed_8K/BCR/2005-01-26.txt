This press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are based on management's current expectations, the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not historical in nature and use words such as "anticipate", "estimate", "expect", "project", "intend", "plan", "believe", and other words of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. Many factors may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results including product developments, sales efforts, expenses, the outcomes of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and other economic, business, competitive and regulatory factors.

Please refer to our September 30, 2004 10-Q for more detailed information about these and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied.
 
"Net sales on a constant currency basis", "ongoing net sales" and "net income and diluted earnings per share excluding certain items" are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP, please see the attached tables. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency and ongoing basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales. The company believes that comparing ongoing net sales between periods provides an additional and meaningful analysis of comparable operations. Net income and diluted EPS excluding certain items are used by the company to measure the comparability of results between periods. Because certain items such as divestiture activity and litigation outcomes may not reflect underlying operating results, the company believes the exclusion of these and similar items provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net income and diluted EPS. The limitation of these non-GAAP measures is that they may exclude items that impact actual GAAP results. All non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as a replacement for GAAP results.
