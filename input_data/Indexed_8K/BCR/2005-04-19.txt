This press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are based on management's current expectations, the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not historical in nature and use words such as "anticipate", "estimate", "expect", "project", "intend", "forecast", "plan", "believe", and other words of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. Many factors may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results including product developments, sales efforts, expenses, the outcomes of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and other economic, business, competitive and regulatory factors. The company undertakes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements. Please refer to our December 31, 2004 10-K for more detailed information about these and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied.
 
The company sold certain assets of its Endoscopic Technologies division on September 30, 2004. Net sales excluding sales of the divested Endoscopic Technologies products are referred to as "ongoing net sales". The earnings per share figures reported in this press release reflect the company's two-for-one common stock split that became effective on May 28, 2004.
 
"Net sales, excluding foreign exchange", "ongoing net sales" and "net income and diluted earnings per share excluding certain items" are non-GAAP financial measures. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency and ongoing basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales. The company believes that comparing ongoing net sales between periods provides an additional and meaningful analysis of comparable operations. Net income and EPS excluding certain items are used by the company to measure the comparability of results between periods. Because certain items such as investment gains and litigation outcomes may not reflect underlying operating results, the company believes the exclusion of these and similar items provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net income and EPS. The limitation of these non-GAAP measures is that, by excluding certain items, they do not reflect results on a standardized reporting basis. All non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as a replacement for GAAP results.
