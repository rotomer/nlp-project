ITEM 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On February 8, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of C. R. Bard, Inc. approved the 2006 performance criteria under the 2005 Executive Bonus Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan, formerly known as the 1994 Executive Bonus Plan of C. R. Bard, Inc., was amended and restated in June 2005 and filed as Exhibit 10ax to the company's June 30, 2005 Form 10-Q. The performance criteria include (i) growth in earnings per share, and (ii) to a lesser degree, sales, cash flow from operations and return on investment. Bonus calculations are based on operational results that are generally exclusive of items of an unusual or infrequent nature and other items that affect comparability of results between periods, including changes in accounting principles. Bonus targets for the company's named executive officers range from 70% to 125% of base salary. Depending on the performance of the company, the bonus payments could be higher or lower than the target amount. For Group Vice Presidents, 50% of their bonuses will be calculated based on the degree to which their respective business units achieve results, and 50% will be calculated based on the corporate financial targets described above. No award under the Plan shall exceed $1,800,000 with respect to any fiscal year.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
