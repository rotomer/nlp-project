C.R. Bard, Inc. announced that a U.S. District Court jury in Arizona found that certain of W.L. Gore & Associates Inc.'s ePTFE vascular grafts and stent-grafts infringe Bard patent number 6,436,135. The jury upheld the validity of the patent and awarded $185 million in past damages. The jury also found that Gore willfully infringed the patent. In a second phase of the trial, the court is currently assessing Gore's assertion that the patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct. Bard expects that Gore will file post-trial motions with the court with respect to the jury's decision. After a judgment is entered, the case may be appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
