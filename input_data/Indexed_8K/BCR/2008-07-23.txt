This press release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the above tables.
This press release includes net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the company's investors.
In addition, this press release includes the following non-GAAP measures: (1) cost of goods sold excluding a charge for an asset disposition; (2) research & development expense excluding payments for purchased research and development; (3) other (income) expense, net excluding a charge for an asset disposition; (4) the tax effect of the items set forth in (1) through (3) above; (5) net income excluding the items set forth in (1) through (4) above; and (6) diluted earnings per share excluding the items set forth in (1) through (4) above.
The company excluded the items described above because they may cause certain statements of income categories not to be indicative of ongoing operating results, and therefore affect the comparability of results between periods. The company therefore believes that these non-GAAP measures provide an additional and meaningful assessment of the company's ongoing operating performance. Because the company has historically reported these non-GAAP results to the investment community, management also believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of the company's historic operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods. Management uses these non-GAAP measures: (1) to establish financial and operational goals; (2) to monitor the company's actual performance in relation to its business plan and operating budgets; (3) to evaluate the company's core operating performance and understand key trends within the business; and (4) as part of several components it considers in determining incentive compensation.
Management recognizes that the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations, including the fact that they may not be comparable with similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and that management must exercise judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP financial information. Management compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of each non-GAAP financial measure and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. All non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, please see the above tables.
