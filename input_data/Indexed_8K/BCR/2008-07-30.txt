C. R. Bard, Inc. announced that a U.S. District Court in Arizona entered judgment in Bard's favor in its patent infringement suit against W.L. Gore & Associates. The Court ruled that Gore failed to prove that Bard's patent number 6,436,135 was unenforceable due to inequitable conduct. As previously announced, on December 11, 2007, a jury found that Gore willfully infringed Bard's patent through the sale of Gore's ePTFE vascular grafts and stent-grafts, and awarded Bard $185 million in past damages. Gore may file post-trial motions with the court and may appeal the judgment to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
