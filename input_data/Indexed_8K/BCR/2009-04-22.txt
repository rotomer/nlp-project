On April 22, 2009, C. R. Bard, Inc. (the "Company") announced a plan to improve its overall cost structure and improve efficiency, which plan was approved by the Board of Directors of the Company on April 15, 2009. The plan includes the consolidation of certain businesses in the United States and the realignment of certain sales and marketing functions outside the United States. The Company expects this plan to result in the elimination of certain positions and other employee terminations worldwide.
In connection with this plan, the Company estimates that it will incur total pre-tax charges of $14 million to $16 million. Substantially all of this charge is expected to result in cash expenditures related to separation costs and other employee termination expenses. In the first quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a charge of $9.8 million ($6.5 million after tax) to other (income) expense, net, to reflect employee separation costs, which were determined under the Company's existing severance programs. The Company expects activities under the plan to be substantially complete in the second quarter of 2009.
