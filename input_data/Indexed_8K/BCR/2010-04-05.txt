Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
C. R. Bard, Inc. (the "Company") offers a relocation assistance program for employees who relocate at our request and whose relocation meets certain mileage and other criteria. We believe this program offers sufficient assistance to encourage employees to accept the relocation and to remain focused on the new opportunity. The relocation program provides a relocating executive who is eligible for benefits under this program with financial assistance, both in selling his or her existing home and in purchasing a new residence. It also provides assistance with moving, temporary housing and cost of living adjustments. The program requires the employee to enter into a relocation agreement and provides that if an employee voluntarily terminates employment with the Company within 24 months of the effective date of relocation, the employee (i) forfeits any remaining payments that may be due under the relocation program, and (ii) will be required to repay in full all relocation expenses paid to the employee or incurred by the Company on the employee's behalf. In certain cases, the Company has increased this period to 36 months, including for executive officers, emphasizing the long-term commitment associated with the relocation.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
