C. R. Bard, Inc. announced that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the decision of the District Court in the previously-disclosed class action lawsuit entitled St. Francis Medical Center, et al. v. C. R. Bard, Inc., et al. (Civil Action No. 1:07-cv-00031, United States District Court, Eastern District of Missouri, Southeastern Division). In September 2009, the District Court granted Bard's summary judgment motion and dismissed with prejudice all counts brought against Bard in this action. St. Francis Medical Center can request that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit re-hear its appeal and/or request a review of the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.
