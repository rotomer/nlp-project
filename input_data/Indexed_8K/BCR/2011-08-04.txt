C. R. Bard, Inc. (the "Company") announced that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (the "Court of Appeals") has denied St. Francis Medical Center's petition for a re-hearing of its appeal in the previously-disclosed class action lawsuit entitled (Civil Action No. 1:07-cv-00031, United States District Court, Eastern District of Missouri, Southeastern Division). In June 2011, the Court of Appeals, in a re-hearing of its prior decision, affirmed the decision of the District Court that granted the Company's summary judgment motion and dismissed with prejudice all counts brought against the Company in this action. St. Francis Medical Center may request a review of the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.
