As part of the new product launches, BD has entered into two separate and unrelated strategic relationships with industry leaders Medtronic MiniMed, the diabetes management business of Medtronic, Inc. (NYSE: MDT), and Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) (NYSE: LLY) to increase its diabetes care market presence. "We are very excited to unveil our new products that offer patients a less painful, more convenient solution to managing their blood glucose levels," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of BD. "We believe these products set a new performance standard in the blood glucose monitoring industry. In addition, the strategic relationships we are announcing today with Medtronic MiniMed and Lilly, each leaders in their respective diabetes care markets, will significantly expand the reach of BD's new blood glucose products. Through these relationships, we also intend to pursue next-generation diabetes products." The BD Logic'TM' Blood Glucose Monitor is a cutting edge meter with best-in-class strip technology, an easy-to-read display screen and large data capacity. The BD Latitude'TM' Diabetes Management System is the first fully integrated therapeutic diabetes device that contains a blood glucose monitor, lancing device, lancets, strips, and storage for an insulin pen and pen needles, all the tools needed to test and inject. Both the BD Logic'TM' Blood Glucose Monitor and the BD Latitude'TM' Diabetes Management System use the thinnest lancet available (33-gauge) to minimize pain and test strips that require only a minimal amount of blood (.3'u'L), and deliver accurate results in just 5 seconds. Under the terms of the worldwide agreement, Medtronic MiniMed will distribute a co-branded version of the BD Logic'TM' Blood Glucose Monitor and BD'TM' strips through its global distribution channels. In addition, the companies will collaborate in the development of integrated systems that provide greater convenience for Medtronic MiniMed pump wearers, who represent the most frequent blood glucose testers.
"This alliance enables us to better serve our customers today by offering a best-in-class monitor and strips, and will extend our leadership position in the future by developing integrated systems to simplify diabetes management," said Jeffery A. McCaulley, Vice President and General Manager, Diabetes, Medtronic MiniMed. "We believe product simplification will foster patient adherence, improving blood sugar control and overall health of diabetes patients." Under the terms of the agreement with Lilly, Lilly will utilize its U.S. diabetes sales organization to provide targeted support for the market introduction of the new BD Latitude'TM' Diabetes Management System, and will help create awareness of the new product with healthcare professionals. There is no sharing of revenue between the companies. Lilly and BD also will jointly pursue future opportunities in diabetes disease management. "Lilly is committed to improving the care and quality of life for people with diabetes and considers this relationship as an opportunity to advance these objectives," said Khoso Baluch, U.S. diabetes care business unit leader for Lilly. A conference call regarding the new BD diabetes products and two agreements will be held on January 8, 2003 at 8:00 a.m. (EST).
