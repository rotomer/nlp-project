Borgognoni/Corporate Communications - 201-847-6651 BD ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR FISCAL FIRST QUARTER Franklin Lakes, NJ (January 23, 2003) - BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported revenues of $1.052 billion for the fiscal first quarter ended December 31, 2002, an increase of 11 percent from the same period a year ago. At constant foreign exchange rates, revenues increased 9 percent. "We are pleased with the Company's strong revenue growth in the quarter, paced by our BD Medical Systems and BD Clinical Laboratory Solutions segments that reflect contributions from several key areas - safety-engineered products, prefillable drug delivery devices and our BD ProbeTec ET'TM' diagnostic instrument platform," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "As we had forecast, BD Biosciences' first quarter revenues were slightly ahead of the prior year's quarter. This reflected the impact of factors unfavorably affecting sales of molecular biology reagents and flow cytometry instruments that we expect will continue through the second quarter, but which we anticipate will improve in the second half of the year." "We are very excited about the launch of our new blood glucose monitoring products, the BD Logic'TM' Blood Glucose Monitor and the BD Latitude'TM' Diabetes Management System," Mr. Ludwig added. "These products are among the most significant launches in the Company's history, and we believe their best-in-class performance characteristics, coupled with our strategic relationships with Medtronic, Inc. and Eli Lilly and Company, position us for success in the blood glucose monitoring market." Diluted earnings per share and net income for the quarter were 43 cents and $114 million, respectively. For the same period in fiscal 2002, diluted earnings per share and net income were 37 cents and $100 million, respectively. Diluted earnings per share reflected, among other things, the benefit of approximately 2 cents related to favorable foreign exchange translation, particularly in Europe.
Segment Results - --------------- In the BD Medical Systems segment, worldwide revenues of $572 million increased 14 percent in the quarter, driven by U.S. safety-engineered product sales of $100 million, versus $78 million in the prior year's quarter, and strong sales of prefillable drug delivery devices, which grew 30 percent to $93 million. Consumer Healthcare products also posted strong growth in the quarter, based in part on a favorable comparison to 2002 in U.S. diabetes syringe sales. The overall growth rate in the segment was partly offset by reduced sales of certain conventional devices in the U.S. due to the transition to safety-engineered devices. In the BD Clinical Laboratory Solutions segment, worldwide revenues increased 13 percent for the quarter to $332 million. Revenue growth of 12 percent in the Preanalytical Solutions portion of the segment was due primarily to strong U.S. safety-engineered product sales, which were $65 million, versus $49 million in the prior year's quarter, and which were partly offset by reduced sales of certain conventional devices in the U.S. due to the transition to safety-engineered devices. Contributing to revenue growth of 13 percent in the Diagnostics Systems portion of the segment were strong sales of respiratory and flu diagnostic tests, especially in Japan, and worldwide sales of its molecular diagnostic platform, BD ProbeTec ET'TM'. The BD Biosciences segment's worldwide revenues were slightly ahead of last year at $148 million. These results reflected strong sales of flow cytometry reagents and immunology/cell biology (Pharmingen) reagents and Discovery Labware products. This growth was partly offset by sales of molecular biology (Clontech) reagents, which were below the prior year due to continued weakness in some portions of the molecular biology research market. In addition, as anticipated, flow cytometry instrument sales growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by a reduction in order backlog in fiscal 2002 resulting from order fulfillment and installation improvements. In addition, favorable reaction to the first quarter announcement of the new BD FACSAria'TM' cell sorter caused some order postponement in anticipation of the availability of this new instrument later in the year. Geographic Results - ------------------ On a geographic basis, first quarter revenues in the U.S. increased 12 percent to $557 million. Revenues outside the U.S. of $494 million grew 10 percent, or 5 percent at constant foreign exchange rates. International revenues in the first quarter benefited from strong performance in Japan, offset in part by the effects of continuing unfavorable economic conditions in Latin America. A conference call regarding BD's first quarter results and its expectations for the second quarter and full fiscal year will be broadcast live on BD's website at 8:30 a.m. EST Thursday, January 23, 2003. The conference call will be available for playback at 1-800-468-0320 (domestic) and 1-402-344-6805 (international) through the close of business on January 30, 2003.
