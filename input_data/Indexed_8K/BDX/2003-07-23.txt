Borgognoni/Corporate Communications - 201-847-6651 Patricia A. Spinella/Investor Relations - 201-847-5453 BD ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR FISCAL THIRD QUARTER Franklin Lakes, NJ (July 24, 2003) - BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported record quarterly revenues of $1.165 billion for the fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2003, an increase of 17 percent from the same period a year ago. At constant foreign exchange rates, revenues increased 11 percent. Revenue growth in all segments benefited from favorable foreign currency translation, particularly with respect to the Euro. Diluted earnings per share and net income for the quarter were 49 cents and $130 million, respectively. Included in third quarter results were non-cash charges of $34 million, recorded in cost of products sold, relating to the write-down of certain intangible assets and inventory in the BD Biosciences segment. These charges reduced net income by $20 million and diluted earnings per share by 8 cents. For the third quarter of fiscal 2002, diluted earnings per share were 44 cents and net income was $120 million, including special charges of $12 million, or 4 cents per share relating to the manufacturing restructuring in the BD Medical Systems segment. "Strong revenue growth in all three of our business segments, as well as in most of our international regions, was the driving force behind another sound quarter for BD," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Of the many products that added to this quarter's revenue growth, we were especially pleased by the contribution from the BD FACSAria'TM', our recently launched BD Biosciences instrument, which generated $20 million in revenue." Q3 Segment Results - ------------------ In the BD Medical Systems segment, worldwide revenues of $648 million increased 19 percent. The Medical Surgical, Pharmaceutical Systems and Consumer Healthcare units each contributed double-digit growth to the segment's results. Included in BD Medical Systems revenues were U.S. safety-engineered product sales of $101 million, versus $88 million in the prior year's quarter. The overall growth rate in the segment was offset in part by reduced sales of conventional devices in the U.S. due to the transition to safety-engineered devices.
In the BD Clinical Laboratory Solutions segment, worldwide revenues increased 13 percent to $338 million. Revenue growth of 11 percent in the Preanalytical Solutions unit of the segment was attributable in part to U.S. safety-engineered device sales, which were $66 million, versus $57 million in the prior year's quarter. These results were offset in part by reduced sales of conventional devices due to the transition to safety-engineered devices. Worldwide revenues of the Diagnostic Systems unit of the segment increased 17 percent. This growth reflected strong worldwide sales of its molecular diagnostic platform, BD ProbeTec'TM' ET. In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues grew 14 percent to $179 million. Revenue growth was driven by strong sales of the new BD FACSAria'TM' cell sorter, which BD Biosciences began shipping at the end of March, and by sales of immunology/cell biology reagents. This growth was offset in part by continued weaker demand for certain molecular biology (Clontech) reagents. Non-Cash Charges - ---------------- During the third quarter, the BD Biosciences segment discontinued the development of certain products and product applications associated with its BD IMAGN'TM' instrument platform. In connection with this decision, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $27 million for related intangible assets and inventory. In addition, as the result of a revised outlook with respect to under-performing portions of its molecular biology (Clontech) product line, BD Biosciences wrote down the value of related inventory and intellectual property by $7 million. In connection with the foregoing decisions, in the third quarter, the Company recorded, in cost of products sold, non-cash charges of $34 million. Q3 Geographic Results - --------------------- On a geographic basis, third quarter revenues in the U.S. increased 10 percent to $583 million. Revenues outside the U.S. of $582 million grew 24 percent, or 11 percent at constant foreign exchange rates. International revenues in the third quarter, benefited from favorable foreign exchange as well as strong performance in Europe, Canada, Japan, and Asia Pacific, offset in part by the effects of unfavorable performance and economic conditions in Latin America. Nine-Month Results - ------------------ For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2003, reported revenues were $3.351 billion, a 13 percent increase over a year ago, or 9 percent at constant foreign exchange rates. Diluted earnings per share for the nine-month period were $1.46, or $1.54 excluding the aforementioned non-cash charges relating to intangible asset impairments and inventory write-downs. For the same period in fiscal 2002, diluted earnings per share were $1.29, or $1.35 before the special charges related to the manufacturing restructuring in the BD Medical Systems segment. Fiscal 2003 Outlook - ------------------- For the fourth quarter, the Company expects diluted earnings per share of 60 cents, and $2.06 for the full fiscal year, or $2.14 excluding the 8 cents of non-cash charges relating to the intangible asset impairments and inventory write-downs included in the third quarter results. These expectations assume that foreign currency exchange rates, in particular as related to the Euro, remain approximately at current levels.
