The Company may also establish and have such other offices within or without the State of New Jersey, as the Board of Directors may designate or its business may require. ARTICLE II Meetings of Shareholders SECTION 1. PLACE OF MEETINGS. Meetings of the shareholders shall be held at the registered office of the Company in New Jersey, or at such other place, within or without the State of New Jersey, as may be designated by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting. SECTION 2.A. ANNUAL MEETINGS. The annual meeting of shareholders for the election of directors and the transaction of such other business as may be related to the purposes set forth in the notice of the meeting shall be held at such time as may be fixed by the Board of Directors. B. SPECIAL MEETING FOR ELECTION OF DIRECTORS. If the annual meeting of shareholders is not held on the date designated, the Board of Directors may call a special meeting of the shareholders for the election of directors and the transaction of other business. C. SPECIAL MEETINGS. Special meetings of the shareholders may be called by the Board of Directors or by the Chairman of the Board or by the President, and shall be called by the Chairman of the Board or by the President upon written request of a majority of the Directors then in office, which request shall state the time, place and purpose of the meeting. D. ADVANCE NOTICE OF NOMINATIONS AND BUSINESS TO BE TRANSACTED AT ANNUAL MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS. No business may be transacted at an annual meeting of shareholders, other than business that is either (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof), (b) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or (c) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by any shareholder of the Company (i) who is a shareholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 2.D. and on the
record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote at such annual meeting and (ii) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.D. In addition to any other applicable requirements, for nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors or for other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder, such shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the Company. To be timely, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Company not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders; provided however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for on a date that is not within 30 days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder in order to be timely must be so received not earlier than the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of shareholder's notice as described above. Notwithstanding anything in the first sentence of the preceding paragraph to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors is increased and there is no notice or public disclosure by the Company naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least 70 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 2.D. shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made. To be in proper written form, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must set forth (a) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and Rule 14a-11 thereunder (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected), (b) as to each matter such shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (c) the name and record address of such shareholder, (d) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Company that are owned beneficially or of record by such shareholder, (e) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such shareholder and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with -2-
such nomination or proposal of such business by such shareholder and any material interest of such shareholder in such business and (f) a representation that such shareholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such business before the meeting. No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of shareholders except business brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.D; provided, however, that, once business has been properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with such procedures, nothing in Section 2.D. shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any shareholder of any such business. If the Chairman of an annual meeting determines that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the Chairman shall declare to the meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting and such business shall not be transacted. SECTION 3. QUORUM. The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of shares representing a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at a meeting shall constitute a quorum. The shareholders present in person or by proxy at a duly organized meeting may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum. If a quorum not be present or represented at any meeting, the Chairman of the meeting or a majority of the shareholders present in person, or by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting without notice until the required voting shares shall be represented. At such adjourned meeting with the requisite amount of voting shares represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. SECTION 4. NOTICE OF MEETINGS. A written notice of each annual or special meeting of the shareholders of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board or the President or the Secretary, which shall state the time, place and purpose of such meeting, shall be delivered personally or mailed, not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days before the date of any such meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, the notice shall be directed to the shareholder at his address as it appears on the records of the stock transfer agent. Any shareholder, in person or by proxy, may at any time by a duly signed statement in writing to that effect, waive any statutory or other notice of any meeting, whether such statement be signed before or after such meeting. SECTION 5. VOTING. At all meetings of the shareholders, each holder of common stock having the right to vote, and present at the meeting in person or by proxy, shall be entitled to one vote for each full share of common stock of the Company entitled to vote and registered in his name. Each holder of preferred stock of any series shall have such voting powers, if any, as the Board of Directors shall have fixed by resolution prior to the issuance of any shares of such series. Whenever any action is to be taken by vote of the shareholders, it shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of the shareholders by the holders of shares entitled to vote, unless a greater plurality is required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation. -3-
SECTION 6. PROXIES. Any shareholder of record entitled to vote may be represented at any annual or special meeting of the shareholders by a duly appointed proxy. All proxies shall be written and properly signed, but shall require no other attestation, and shall be filed with the Secretary of the meeting before being voted. SECTION 7. ORGANIZATION. The Chairman of the Board, or in the absence of the Chairman of the Board, the Vice Chairman or the President, shall act as chairman of the meeting at all meetings of the shareholders. The Secretary, or in his absence one of the Assistant Secretaries, shall act as secretary of the meeting. In case none of the officers above designated to act as Chairman or Secretary of the meeting shall be present, a chairman or a secretary of the meeting, as the case may be, shall be chosen by a vote of the shareholders. SECTION 8. ORDER OF BUSINESS. The order of business at all meetings of the shareholders shall be as determined by the Chairman of the meeting, but the order of business to be followed at any meeting at which a quorum is present may be changed by a vote of the shareholders. SECTION 9. RECORD DATE FOR ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT. In order that the Corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in New Jersey, its principal place of business or to any officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action. Nothing in this Article II, Section 9 shall require the Board of Directors to take any action with respect to any proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought other than to fix a record date as provided for herein; and the fixing of any such record date shall not be deemed to be an action taken by the Board of Directors with -4-
respect to any such proposed action or other proposal for which consent is sought for any other purpose. SECTION 10. INSPECTORS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by Article II, Section 9, to the Company of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Company shall engage nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Company that the consents delivered to the Company in accordance with Article II, Section 9 represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any shareholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation). SECTION 11. EFFECTIVENESS OF WRITTEN CONSENT. Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each shareholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with Article II, Section 9, a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to the Company in the manner prescribed in Article II, Section 9. ARTICLE III Directors SECTION 1. QUALIFICATIONS. Each Director shall be at least 21 years of age, a shareholder of record of the Company, and shall be elected in the manner provided by these By-Laws.

The Board of Directors shall control and manage the business and affairs of the Company, and shall exercise all powers of the Company and perform all acts which are not required to be exercised or performed by the shareholders. The Directors may adopt such rules and regulations for the conduct of their meetings and the management of the Company as they may deem proper. SECTION 3. PLACE OF MEETINGS. Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at the principal office of the Company or at such other place within or without the State of New Jersey, as the Chairman of the Board or the Board may designate. -5-
SECTION 4. TELEPHONE MEETINGS. Any or all Directors may participate in a meeting of the Board or a committee of the Board by means of conference telephone or any means of communication by which all persons participating in the meeting are able to hear each other. SECTION 5. NOTICE OF MEETINGS. There shall be an annual meeting of the Board of Directors held without notice immediately following the annual meeting of shareholders, or as soon thereafter as convenient, at the same place as the annual meeting of shareholders unless some other location is designated by the Chairman of the Board or by the President. Regular meetings, without notice, may be held at such time and place as the Board of Directors may designate. The Chairman of the Board or the President may call any special meeting of the Board of Directors, and shall do so whenever requested in writing by at least one-third of the Directors. Notice of each special meeting shall be mailed to each director at least four days before the date on which the meeting is to be held, or be telephoned or sent to each Director by telegraph, telex, TWX, cable, wireless or similar means of communication, or be delivered in person, not later than the day before the date on which such meeting is to be held. The Board of Directors may meet to transact business at any time and place without notice, provided that each director shall be present, or that any Director or Directors not present shall waive notice in writing, either before or after such meeting. The attendance of any Director at a meeting without protesting prior to the conclusion of the meeting the lack of notice of such meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice by him. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting. Notice of an adjourned meeting need not be given if the time and place are fixed at the meeting adjourning and if the period of adjournment does not exceed 10 days in any one adjournment. SECTION 6. QUORUM. A majority of the Directors then in office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, but the Director or Directors present, if less than a quorum, may adjourn any meeting from time to time until such quorum shall be present. All questions coming before the Board of Directors shall be determined and decided by a majority vote of the Directors present, unless the vote of a greater number is required by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws. SECTION 7. ACTION WITHOUT A MEETING. The Board of Directors may act without a meeting if, prior or subsequent to such action, each Director shall consent in writing to such action. Such written consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board of Directors. SECTION 8. COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS. The Board may, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Directors then in office, fix reasonable fees or compensation of the Directors for services to the Company, including attendance at meetings of the Board of Directors or Committees of the Board.

The Audit Committee may delegate its authority to subcommittees or the Chair of the Audit Committee when it deems appropriate and in the best interests of the Company. Limitations Inherent in the Audit Committee's Role While the Audit Committee has the responsibilities and powers set forth in this Charter, it is not the duty of the Audit Committee to plan or conduct audits or to determine that the Company's financial statements are complete and accurate and are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This is the responsibility of management and the independent auditor. Nor is it the duty of the Audit Committee to conduct investigations or to ensure compliance with laws and regulations and the Company's Code of Conduct. This is the responsibility of management, subject to oversight by the Board of Directors. SECTION 5. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS COMMITTEE.
