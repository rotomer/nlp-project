Spinella, Investor Relations - 201-847-5453 BD Statement Regarding Voluntary National Recall of BD ProbeTec'TM' ------------------------------------------------------------------- ET Instrument ------------- Franklin Lakes, NJ (August 22, 2003) - BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE:BDX) today provided a summary of its voluntary product recall of the BD ProbeTec'TM' ET instrument for the detection of Chlamydia and gonorrhea, initiated July 21, 2003. Neither the costs anticipated with this recall, nor the impact on BD's ProbeTec'TM' ET instrument business, are expected to be significant. Last month, BD received one report from the field in the U.S. regarding a defect discovered in the course of instrument evaluation. An investigation by BD determined that the optical bundles may have been incorrectly installed in certain instruments, which could produce false positive and false negative results for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis with specimens from symptomatic and asymptomatic males and females. It was determined that this particular instrument produced 12 inaccurate results within the two week time period it was in use. The incorrect patient samples were identified, retested, and the physicians notified. BD initiated a field corrective action that included notifying customers worldwide and asking them to perform a test to verify the functioning of each instrument. To date, 522 units out of 526 distributed in the United States have been checked and found to be functioning correctly. The remaining four units will be tested by BD. Nearly 100% of the instruments worldwide (about 1000 units) have been tested, and only one additional defective unit used for patient testing has been identified, in Canada. BD is working directly with Health Canada to ensure that all appropriate parties are notified. BD has adopted additional quality checks and reviews of the optical bundle assembly process to prevent any potential recurrence. The instruments, manufactured since September 1998 and distributed through June 2003, have serial numbers 1001 through 2056. BD has notified Health Canada and the FDA and is working with them to coordinate recall activities. Patients, laboratories or physicians with questions can contact Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Systems at 1-800-638-8663, selection 2.
