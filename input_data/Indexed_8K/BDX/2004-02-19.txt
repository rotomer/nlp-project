Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure. The following statement is being furnished by the Company under the provisions of Regulation FD: On February 19, 2004, Gary M. Cohen, President - BD Medical of Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD"), exercised stock options for 97,612 BD shares and sold the shares acquired upon exercise. These options were granted in 1996 and were due to expire in January 2006. In addition, Mr. Cohen purchased 5,436 shares of BD in connection with the exercise of additional stock options. As a result of these transactions, Mr. Cohen's beneficial ownership of BD shares (excluding stock options) has increased to 47,183 shares, and his beneficial ownership continues to be in excess of the requirements under BD's share ownership guidelines, which require Mr. Cohen to own shares equal in value to at least three times his salary. Mr. Cohen has also elected, on a discretionary basis, to defer a portion of his 2004 salary into a BD stock account under BD's deferred compensation plan. The transactions announced today are part of Mr. Cohen's financial strategy of asset diversification and liquidity.
