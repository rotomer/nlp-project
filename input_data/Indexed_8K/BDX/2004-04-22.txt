At constant foreign exchange rates, revenues increased 6 percent. Revenue growth in all segments benefited from favorable foreign currency translation, particularly with respect to the Euro. "We are pleased with the Company's continued strong performance in the second quarter. Solid revenue growth in our BD Medical and BD Biosciences segments reflects contributions from several key areas - prefillable drug delivery devices, diabetes related products and our BD FACSAria'TM' cell sorter," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Strong revenue growth in nearly all of our international regions was another driving force." Diluted earnings per share and net income for the quarter were 62 cents and $165 million, respectively. For the same period in fiscal 2003, diluted earnings per share were 54 cents and net income was $142 million. Q2 Segment Results In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $683 million, representing an increase of 13 percent over the prior year period. Included in BD Medical revenues were U.S. safety-engineered product sales of $107 million, as compared with $98 million in the prior year's quarter, which was offset in part by reduced sales of certain conventional devices in the U.S. due to the transition to safety-engineered devices. Also contributing to the growth of the segment were increased sales of diabetes related products and prefillable drug delivery devices. In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $383 million, representing an increase of 7 percent over the prior year period. Revenue growth of 11 percent in the Preanalytical Systems unit of the segment included U.S. safety-engineered device sales of $75 million, compared with $68 million in the prior year's quarter, which was offset in part by reduced sales of conventional devices in the U.S. due to the transition to safety-engineered devices. After having experienced a 31 percent increase in the first quarter, due in large part to earlier than usual and exceptionally strong sales of respiratory and flu diagnostic tests in the U.S. and Japan, revenues in the Diagnostic Systems unit of the segment increased 3 percent in the second quarter. For the first half of fiscal 2004, the Diagnostic Systems unit reported 17 percent revenue growth.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues were $205 million, representing an increase of 17 percent over the prior year period. These results reflected broad market acceptance of the BD FACSAria'TM' cell sorter, which BD Biosciences began shipping at the end of the second fiscal quarter of 2003, along with strong sales of flow cytometry reagents in the Immunocytometry Systems and Pharmingen units. Revenue growth was also driven by Discovery Labware products. Q2 Geographic Results Second quarter revenues in the U.S. of $619 million represented an increase of 7 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside the U.S. of $651 million represented an increase of 17 percent over the prior year period, or 4 percent at constant foreign exchange rates. International revenues in the second quarter benefited from favorable foreign exchange in substantially all regions. Excluding the impact of favorable foreign exchange, revenues increased in substantially all regions. Six-month Results For the six-month period ended March 31, 2004, reported revenues were $2.470 billion, a 13 percent increase over the same period a year ago, or 6 percent at constant foreign exchange rates. Diluted earnings per share for the six-month period were $1.10. For the same period in fiscal 2003, diluted earnings per share were 97 cents. Included in the first half results of fiscal 2004 was a first quarter charge of 11 cents related to certain actions taken in connection with our blood glucose monitoring products. Excluding the charge of 11 cents, pro forma diluted earnings per share for the first half of fiscal 2004 were $1.21. Fiscal 2004 Outlook The Company estimates that its reported diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2004, which includes a charge of 11 cents per share relating to its blood glucose monitoring products, will increase in the range of 10 to 12 percent over the prior period. This estimate is based on fiscal 2003 pro forma earnings per share of $2.15, which excludes 8 cents of non-cash charges related to the write-down of certain intangible assets and inventory in the BD Biosciences segment.
