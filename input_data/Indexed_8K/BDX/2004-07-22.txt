Exhibit 99.1 Contact: - -------- Patricia A. Spinella, Investor Relations - 201-847-5453 Colleen T. White, Corporate Communications - 201-847-5369 BD ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR FISCAL THIRD QUARTER Franklin Lakes, NJ (July 22, 2004) - BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported quarterly revenues of $1.258 billion for the fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2004, representing an increase of 8 percent from the same period a year ago. At constant foreign exchange rates, revenues increased 5 percent. Revenue growth in all segments benefited from favorable foreign currency translation, particularly with respect to the Euro. Diluted earnings per share and net income for the quarter were 41 cents and $109 million, respectively. As announced in our July 2, 2004 press release, third quarter results included a pre-tax charge of $100 million relating to the agreement with Retractable Technologies, Inc. to settle its lawsuit against BD. This charge reduced net income by $63 million and diluted earnings per share by 24 cents. For the third quarter of fiscal 2003, reported diluted earnings per share and net income were 49 cents and $130 million, respectively. Included in these prior period results was a charge of $34 million related to the write-down of certain intangible assets and inventory in the BD Biosciences segment. This charge reduced diluted earnings per share by 8 cents and net income by $20 million. Excluding the charge of 8 cents, pro forma diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 were 57 cents. "These results reflect another solid quarter of revenue and earnings growth, fueled especially by sales of safety-engineered products and immunocytometry instruments and reagents, along with improved gross profit margins," stated Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "In addition, having settled the lawsuit, we can now concentrate all of our efforts on driving revenue growth through innovation focused on products that have a higher benefit to patients, healthcare workers and researchers." Q3 Segment Results In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $683 million, representing an increase of 5 percent over the prior year period. BD Medical revenues reflect the continued conversion in the U.S. to safety-engineered products, which had sales of $110 million, as compared with $101 million in the prior year's quarter. The BD Medical sales growth rate was constrained by comparison to a particularly strong quarter in fiscal 2003.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $374 million, representing an increase of 11 percent over the prior year period. Revenue growth of 12 percent in the Preanalytical Systems unit of the segment reflects the continued conversion in the U.S. to safety-engineered devices which had sales of $80 million, compared with $66 million in the prior year's quarter. Revenue growth of 9 percent in the Diagnostic Systems unit of the segment included solid worldwide sales of its molecular diagnostic platform, BD ProbeTec'TM' ET. In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $201 million, representing an increase of 12 percent over the prior year period. Instrument revenue growth was driven by sales of the recently launched BD FACSCanto'TM' and BD FACSArray'TM' analyzers and continued strong performance of the BD FACSAria'TM' cell sorter. Sales of flow cytometry reagents were also strong in both the clinical and the research markets. Q3 Geographic Results Third quarter revenues in the U.S. of $617 million represented an increase of 6 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside the U.S. of $641 million represented an increase of 10 percent over the prior year period, or 4 percent at constant foreign exchange rates. Nine-Month Results For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2004, reported revenues were $3.728 billion, an 11 percent increase over the same period a year ago, or 6 percent at constant foreign exchange rates. Reported diluted earnings per share for the nine-month period were $1.51. Included in the nine-month results of fiscal 2004 was a first quarter charge of 11 cents related to certain actions taken in connection with our blood glucose monitoring products and a third quarter charge of 24 cents related to the previously mentioned litigation settlement. Excluding both these charges, pro forma diluted earnings per share for the nine-month period were $1.86. For the same nine-month period in fiscal 2003, reported diluted earnings per share were $1.46. Excluding the aforementioned charge of 8 cents related to the write-down of certain intangible assets and inventory in the BD Biosciences segment, pro forma diluted earnings per share for the nine-month period in fiscal 2003 were $1.54. Fiscal 4Q 2004 Outlook For the fourth quarter, the Company expects reported diluted earnings per share will increase about 10 percent.
