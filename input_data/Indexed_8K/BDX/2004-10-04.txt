Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition. On October 4, 2004, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing that its Board of Directors had approved a plan to sell BD's Clontech operation. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. On September 30, 2004, the Board of Directors of BD approved a plan to sell BD's Clontech operation, a unit of the BD Biosciences segment. The plan to divest Clontech is a result of BD Bioscience's decision to focus its strategy on cell analysis, discovery labware and its new platforms of imaging and in vitro drug metabolism/toxicity testing. BD expects to complete the divestiture of Clontech in the second quarter of BD's 2005 fiscal year. Goldman Sachs & Company is acting as BD's financial advisor in connection with the planned sale. BD estimates that it will record a pre-tax loss in its 2004 fiscal fourth quarter of approximately $125 million ($115 million after-tax), or approximately $0.44 per share, in connection with the planned sale. This charge, other than for certain immaterial cash costs of approximately $2 million, consists of non-cash charges relating to the write down of the business' assets (primarily intangible assets) to fair value. The above estimates of the charges to be incurred in connection with the planned sale of Clontech are based upon current expectations of BD and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual charges could vary materially from BD's estimates. Factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from BD's estimates include, but are not limited to, BD's ability to successfully complete the proposed divestiture within the expected timeframe, and the structure of any transaction involving a divestiture of Clontech and the purchase price and other terms relating thereto. BD does not intend to update any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof, except as required by applicable laws or regulations.
