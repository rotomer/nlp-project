Spinella, Investor Relations - 201-847-5453 BD BOARD DECLARES DIVIDEND INCREASE AND AUTHORIZES ADDITIONAL SHARE REPURCHASES Franklin Lakes, NJ (November 23, 2004) - The Board of Directors of BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE:BDX) has declared a quarterly dividend of 18 cents per common share, an increase of 3 cents per share or 20% from the previous quarter. The dividend will be payable on January 3, 2005 to holders of record on December 13, 2004. At the current rate, the annual dividend would be 72 cents per share, a rise of 20% from a year ago. The Board has also authorized the Company to repurchase up to 10 million common shares of the Company. The Company plans to use the shares for general corporate purposes. This authorization is in addition to the approximately 4.1 million shares that remained available at September 30, 2004 under a 10 million-share repurchase authorization approved in January 2004. On September 30, 2004, the Company had approximately 249 million common shares outstanding. The Company said the new authorization is consistent with continued strong cash flow. "This is the 32nd year in a row that BD has increased its dividends. Our dividend, along with the repurchasing of our shares, has allowed us to return significant dollars to our shareholders," said Edward J. Ludwig, BD Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "This provides evidence that the strategy we have been implementing over the last several years is working. We're continuing to pursue this strategy of growth through innovation combined with operational effectiveness, and our shareholders will continue to be the beneficiaries." BD is a medical technology company that serves healthcare institutions, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, industry and the general public. BD manufactures and sells a broad range of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment and diagnostic products. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, BD reported total revenues of $4.935 billion. ***
