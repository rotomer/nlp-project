Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure. On February 9, 2005, Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD"), entered into a pre-arranged trading plan (the "Plan") established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and BD's policies with respect to stock transactions. Pursuant to the Plan, Mr. Ludwig intends to exercise options for 180,000 shares, and to sell 171,000 of the shares acquired upon exercise, over a nine-month period beginning in March 2005. The shares will be sold on the open market at prevailing market prices, subject to a minimum price threshold. The Plan follows the completion of a prior trading plan reported on May 27, 2004, and is part of Mr. Ludwig's long-term financial strategy for prudent asset diversification and liquidity. The options covered by the Plan were granted in January 1997 and were scheduled to expire in January 2007. These options represent approximately 18% of the vested options and 13.5% of the total options held by Mr. Ludwig. Excluding the options covered by the Plan, Mr. Ludwig holds additional options to acquire 1,152,964 BD shares. Mr. Ludwig currently beneficially owns approximately 126,680 shares of BD (excluding shares that may be acquired under stock options or performance-based awards). Mr. Ludwig's share holdings exceed the target ownership level for the CEO under BD's share retention and ownership guidelines of shares having a value of at least five times salary. Rule 10b5-1 allows persons who are not aware of material, non-public information to adopt written, pre-arranged trading plans. Individuals may use these plans to diversify their investment portfolios over time. Mr. Ludwig, as well as other BD officers and directors, may adopt similar plans in the future. BD does not undertake to report Rule 10b5-1 plans that may be adopted by any officers or directors of BD in the future, or to report any modifications or termination of any publicly announced plan, except to the extent required by law.
