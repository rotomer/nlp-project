Item 8.01 Other Events. On March 25, 2005, Louisiana Wholesale Drug Company, Inc., a Louisiana corporation, filed a proposed class action lawsuit against Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") in the United States District Court in Newark, New Jersey. The complaint alleges that BD violated federal antitrust laws, resulting in the charging of higher prices for certain BD products to plaintiff and other proposed class members. The plaintiff seeks money damages in an as yet undisclosed amount. BD believes that the plaintiff's allegations are without merit and intends to defend this lawsuit vigorously. On March 29, 2005, BD and C.A. Greiner & Soehne GmbH ("Greiner") reached a settlement in the patent infringement lawsuit filed by Greiner against BD in January 2004 in the Patent Court of the Central London County Court in London, England. The settlement resolves all outstanding claims in the suit.
