ITEM 2.02
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
On April 27, 2005, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the second fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2005. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted principles (GAAP), as follows:
        BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
        Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on the Company's net income, net income per share, or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.
        BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
ITEM 8.01
OTHER EVENTS.
        On April 15, 2005, the United States District Court, Northern District of Texas, entered an order dismissing without prejudice the proposed action against BD under the Federal False Claims Act.
qui tam
        On April 21, 2005, a suit was brought by Dynovation Medical, Inc. ("Dynovation") against BD (, Civil Action No. 505CV73, United States District Court, Eastern District of Texas). The plaintiffs assert, amount other things, that BD materially breached its license agreement with Dynovation relating to BD's Insyte Autoguard IV catheter product, and that BD's safety blood collection sets infringe certain Dynovation patents. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages and injunctive relief. BD believes that these allegations are without merit and intends to vigorously defend this lawsuit.

BD ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR SECOND FISCAL QUARTER
Franklin Lakes, NJ (April 27, 2005)
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported record quarterly revenues of $1.366 billion for the second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2005, representing an increase of 9 percent over the prior year period. This quarter's growth rate includes an estimated 3 percent benefit from foreign currency translation. Revenue growth in all segments benefited from foreign currency translation, particularly with respect to the Euro.
Reported diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were 72 cents, which reflected diluted earnings per share of 71 cents from continuing operations and 1 cent per share from discontinued operations. Reported diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 were 62 cents, which included less than 1 cent per share from discontinued operations. The results of operations from Clontech, a unit of the BD Biosciences segment, have been classified as "discontinued operations" as a result of the October 4, 2004 announcement of BD's intention to sell Clontech.
 
"We're pleased with our second quarter performance, which reflected revenue growth across all three segments and every global business unit of the Company. The combination of top-line results and continued improvement in operating efficiency resulted in double-digit earnings growth and strong cash flow," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our strong performance enables us to deliver on the commitment we have made to our shareholders to continue to make the additional investments necessary to fuel future innovation."
For the six-month period ended March 31, 2005, reported revenues were $2.654 billion, representing a 9 percent increase from the same period a year ago, including an estimated 3 percent benefit from foreign currency translation. Reported diluted earnings per share for the six-month period ended March 31, 2005 were $1.46, which reflected diluted earnings per share of $1.45 from continuing operations and 1 cent per share from discontinued operations. For the same period in fiscal 2004, reported diluted earnings per share were $1.10 and included income of 1 cent per share from discontinued operations. However, due to rounding, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.10.
 
 
Analyses of Second Quarter and Six-month Period of Fiscal Year 2005 and 2004 Earnings
The following analyses of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter and six-month period of fiscal 2005 and 2004 exclude specified items that affect the comparability of results between periods.
 
 
Based on the foregoing analyses, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, of 75 cents for the second fiscal quarter of 2005 increased by 21 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 62 cents for the second fiscal quarter of 2004. For the six-month period, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, of $1.46 for fiscal 2005 increased by 22 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, of $1.20 for fiscal 2004.
Share-Based Compensation
Effective October 1, 2004, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 123 (revised) relating to the expensing of share-based incentive awards. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter and six-month period included 5 cents and 8 cents, respectively, of share-based compensation expense associated with the adoption of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised), and the equity-based awards granted under the Company's new long-term incentive program. This program consists of a mix of performance-based restricted stock unit awards, time-vested restricted stock unit awards and stock options or stock appreciation rights. We estimate that total share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2005 will be about 17 cents per diluted share.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $732 million, representing an increase of 7 percent from the prior year period. U.S. sales of safety-engineered products totaled $115 million compared with $110 million in the prior year's quarter. The growth rate of U.S. safety-engineered products for the three months ended March 31, 2005 was adversely impacted by a major U.S. distributor reducing its inventory levels. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2005, U.S. sales of safety-engineered products totaled $241 million compared with $224 million in the prior year's period. Included in BD Medical revenues were international sales of
 
safety-engineered products of $21 million, compared with $17 million in the prior year's quarter. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2005, international sales of safety-engineered products totaled $39 million compared with $31 million in the prior year's period. Also contributing to the growth of the segment were strong sales in the Diabetes Care unit and the international portion of the Pharmaceutical Systems unit. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2005, the BD Medical segment reported 9 percent revenue growth.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $430 million, representing an increase of 12 percent from the prior year period. The Preanalytical Systems unit of the segment reported revenue growth of 5 percent. U.S. sales of safety-engineered products totaled $79 million compared with $75 million in the prior year's quarter. The growth rate of U.S. safety-engineered products for the three months ended March 31, 2005 was adversely impacted by a major U.S. distributor reducing its inventory levels. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2005, U.S. sales of safety-engineered products totaled $165 million compared with $151 million in the prior year's period. Included in Preanalytical Systems revenues were international sales of safety-engineered products of $47 million, compared with $34 million in the prior year's quarter. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2005, international sales of safety-engineered products totaled $91 million compared with $64 million in the prior year's period. Revenues in the Diagnostic Systems unit of the segment increased 20 percent based, primarily, on exceptionally strong sales in the quarter of flu diagnostic tests in Japan. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2005, the BD Diagnostics segment reported 8 percent revenue growth.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues from continuing operations for the quarter were $204 million, representing an increase of 8 percent from the prior year period. Instrument revenue growth continued to be the primary growth contributor, driven by sales of the BD FACSCanto and
 
the BD LSR II flow cytometers. Also contributing to the growth of the segment were increased sales in the Discovery Labware unit. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2005, the BD Biosciences segment reported 11 percent revenue growth, representing continued strong sales of flow cytometry instruments and reagents.
Geographic Results
Second quarter revenues in the U.S. of $630 million represented an increase of 3 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside the U.S. of $736 million represented an increase of 14 percent over the prior year period, including an estimated 5 percent benefit from foreign currency translation.
For the six-month period ended March 31, 2005, revenues in the U.S. of $1.254 billion represented an increase of 5 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. of $1.40 billion represented an increase of 13 percent over the prior year period, including an estimated 5 percent benefit from foreign currency translation.
Fiscal 2005 Outlook for Third and Fourth Quarters and Full Year
The following analyses of estimated diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the third and fourth fiscal quarters and full year exclude specified items that affect the comparability of results between periods.
