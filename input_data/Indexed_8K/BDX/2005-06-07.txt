OTHER EVENTS.
        On June 3, 2005, Jabo's Pharmacy, Inc., a business located in Tennessee, filed a proposed class action lawsuit against Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") in the United States District Court in Greeneville, Tennessee (2:05-CV-00162). The complaint, which is similar to the complaint filed in March 2005 against BD in Federal Court in Newark, New Jersey by Louisiana Wholesale Drug Company, alleges that BD violated federal and various state antitrust laws, resulting in the charging of higher prices for certain BD products to plaintiff and other proposed class members. Unlike the Louisiana Wholesale Drug complaint, which is brought on behalf of direct purchasers such as distributors, this new complaint is brought on behalf of indirect purchasers of BD products. BD believes that the plaintiffs' allegations in this lawsuit are without merit and intends to defend against them vigorously.
 
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
