OTHER EVENTS.
     On August 31, 2005, Daniels Sharpsmart, an Illinois company, filed suit against Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD"), another manufacturer and three group purchasing organizations in the United States District Court in Texarkana, Texas (505CV169). The plaintiff alleges, among other things, that BD and the other defendants conspired to exclude the plaintiff from the sharps-collection market by entering into long-term contracts in violation of federal and state antitrust laws. The plaintiff seeks money damages in an as yet undisclosed amount.
     On September 6, 2005, SAJ Distributors, Inc., an Arkansas company, filed a purported class action lawsuit against BD in the United States District Court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (2:05-CV-04763-JD). The complaint alleges that BD violated federal antitrust laws, resulting in the charging of higher prices for certain BD products to plaintiff and other purported class members. This complaint is similar to the complaint filed in March 2005 against BD in Federal Court in Newark, New Jersey by Louisiana Wholesale Drug Company, in that it is brought on behalf of direct purchasers such as distributors. The plaintiff seeks money damages in an as yet undisclosed amount.
     BD believes it has meritorious defenses to these claims and intends to defend these lawsuits vigorously.
 
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
