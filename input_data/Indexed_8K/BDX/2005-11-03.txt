ITEM 2.02
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
On November 3, 2005, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted principles (GAAP), as follows:
 
 
 
 
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
ITEM 8.01
OTHER EVENTS.
          On September 12, 2005, Dik Drug Company filed a purported class action lawsuit against BD in the United States District Court in Newark, New Jersey (2:05-cv-04465-JLL-RJH). On October 3, 2005, American Sales Company, Inc. filed a purported class action against BD in the United States District Court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (2:05-cv-05212-CMR). On October 26, 2005, Park Surgical Co. Inc., a New York corporation, filed a purported class action lawsuit against BD in the United States District Court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (2:05-cv-05678-CMR).
 The complaints allege that BD violated federal antitrust laws, resulting in the charging of higher prices for certain BD products to plaintiffs and other purported class members. These complaints are similar to the previously reported complaints filed in March 2005 against BD in the United States District Court in Newark, New Jersey by Louisiana Wholesale Drug Company, and in September 2005 against BD in the United States District Court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by SAJ Distributors, Inc., in that they are brought on behalf of direct purchasers such as distributors. The plaintiffs seek money damages in as yet undisclosed amounts.
 
          The actions brought by Louisiana Wholesale Drug Company and Dik Drug Company in New Jersey have been consolidated and are now captioned "In re Hypodermic Products Antitrust Litigation." In addition, BD has made a motion before the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to transfer the actions brought by Louisiana Wholesale Drug Company, Dik Drug Company, American Sales Company, Inc., and SAJ Distributors, Inc., along with the previously reported action brought by Jabo's Pharmacy, Inc. against BD in the United States District Court in Greeneville, Tennessee, for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings. BD expects that the action brought by Park Surgical Co. Inc. will be added to BD's motion to the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation in the near future.
 
          BD believes it has meritorious defenses to these claims and intends to defend these lawsuits vigorously.

BD ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER AND FULL YEAR
 
 
 
 
Franklin Lakes, NJ (November 3, 2005)
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported quarterly revenues of $1.379 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2005, representing an increase of 10 percent over the prior year period. This quarter's growth rate includes an estimated 2 percent benefit from foreign currency translation. Revenue growth in all segments benefited from foreign currency translation, driven primarily by favorable exchange rates in Latin America, Asia Pacific, and Canada.
 
"Our excellent results this year were driven, in particular, by our strong international performance, new product revenue growth, and significant margin improvement," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our Asia Pacific/Japan, Canada, Europe, and Latin American regions contributed double-digit revenue growth and the combination of higher margin products and increased operating effectiveness drove margin expansion. Performance such as this will allow us to continue to increase the pace of our R&D spending while also targeting double-digit earnings growth."
 
"Our strong fourth quarter provides a solid foundation for fiscal 2006," added Mr. Ludwig. "We feel confident in our expectation that earnings will grow by approximately 10 percent. On a performance basis, this equates to about 14 percent, excluding the expected negative impact of foreign currency translation."
 
 
 
 
Analyses of Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2005 and 2004 Earnings
The following analyses of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2005 and 2004 identify specified items and share-based compensation expense that affect comparability of results between periods.
 
Included in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 is a benefit of approximately 4 cents per diluted share due to the reversal of tax reserves in connection with the conclusion of tax examinations in four non-U.S. jurisdictions that occurred in the first quarter.
(1)
Represents the effect on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of tax-related events that caused the tax rate to vary from the expected effective tax rate for the year. The effective tax rate for the year, without taking into account the tax impact of the items described in notes (1), (3) and (6) herein, is 25.5%.
(2)
Included in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 is 27 cents per diluted share substantially related to the impact on taxes of the planned repatriation of $1.3 billion of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act.
(3)
Included in fiscal 2004 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is a first quarter charge of 11 cents per diluted share related to the voluntary recall and write-off of certain blood glucose strip inventory and other actions taken with respect to our blood glucose monitoring products.
(4)
Included in fiscal 2004 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is a third quarter charge of 24 cents per diluted share related to a litigation settlement.
(5)
Represents the effect on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations relating to share-based compensation expense in accordance with the first quarter adoption of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised), "Share-Based Payment."
(6)
 
Based on the foregoing analyses, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2005, excluding specified items and share-based compensation expense, of 83 cents increased by 19 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 70 cents for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004. For the year, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items and share-based compensation expense, of $3.07 increased by 20 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, of $2.56 for fiscal 2004.
 
 
 
 
 
Reported diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 were 58 cents, including a 27 cents per diluted share tax charge that relates substantially to the Company's planned repatriation of $1.3 billion of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act, and a gain of 11 cents per diluted share from discontinued operations resulting from the sale of Clontech on August 31, 2005.
 
Reported diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 were 26 cents, reflecting a loss of 44 cents per share from discontinued operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 70 cents.
 
For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, reported revenues were $5.415 billion, representing a 10 percent increase from the prior year, including an estimated 3 percent benefit from foreign currency translation, which was based on favorable exchange rates in all regions. Reported diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 were $2.77, including the previously noted fourth quarter tax charge of 27 cents per share and a gain of 11 cents per share from discontinued operations resulting from the sale of Clontech.
 
For fiscal year 2004, reported diluted earnings per share were $1.77, which reflected diluted earnings per share of $2.21 from continuing operations, and a loss of 44 cents per share from discontinued operations. Included in the results of continuing operations for the year were a first quarter charge of 11 cents per share related to our blood glucose monitoring products and a third quarter charge of 24 cents per share related to a litigation settlement.
