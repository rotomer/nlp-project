OTHER EVENTS.
         On June 6, 2006, UltiMed, Inc., a Minnesota company, filed suit against Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD) in the United States District Court in Minneapolis, Minnesota, (06CV2266). The plaintiff alleges, among other things, that BD excluded the plaintiff from the market for home use insulin syringes by entering into anticompetitive contracts in violation of federal and state antitrust laws. The plaintiff seeks money damages in an as yet undisclosed amount and injunctive relief. BD believes it has meritorious defenses to these claims and intends to defend this lawsuit vigorously.
