ITEM 2.02
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
On July 28, 2006, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the third fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2006. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted principles (GAAP), as follows:
We also present income taxes and effective tax rate for the prior year periods after excluding the effects of significant reversals of tax reserves and/or the effects of changes in tax laws and regulations and other events that caused the tax rate for the period presented to vary from BD's then expected effective tax rate for the full year. Significant reversals of tax reserves and the items mentioned above that effect our periodic effective tax rate cause fluctuations in BD's income from continuing operations from period to period that management believes are unrelated to BD's underlying operating performance. Accordingly, management believes that providing the impact of such effects allows investors to better understand BD's comparative operating performance for the periods presented.
We also present income from operations for the prior year periods after excluding the effects of significant reversals of tax reserves and/or the effects of changes in tax laws and regulations and other events that caused the tax rate for the period presented to vary from BD's then expected effective tax rate for the full year. For the reasons discussed above, management believes that providing the impact of such effects allows investors to better understand BD's comparative operating performance for the periods presented.
 
 
 
 
We also present earnings per share from continuing operations for prior periods after excluding (i) the effects of significant reversals of tax reserves, (ii) the effects of changes in tax laws and regulations and other events that caused the tax rate during the period to vary from BD's expected effective tax rate for the full year, and/or (iii) the impact on taxes of the planned repatriation of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. These items cause fluctuations in BD's operating results that management believes are unrelated to BD's underlying operating performance. Accordingly, management believes that providing the impact of such items allows investors to better understand BD's comparative operating performance for the periods presented.
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
