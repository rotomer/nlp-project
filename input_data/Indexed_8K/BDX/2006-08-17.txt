Exhibit 99.1 Contact: - ------- Colleen T. White, Corporate Communications - 201-847-5369 Patricia A. Spinella, Investor Relations - 201-847-5453 BD Makes Filing to Report Bid to Acquire TriPath Imaging, Inc. Franklin Lakes, N.J. -- Monday, August 14, 2006 -- BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE:BDX) today filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a Statement on Schedule 13D setting forth a proposal it made to acquire for a cash purchase price of $9.25 per share, or approximately $350 million, the approximately 93.5% of the outstanding shares of TriPath Imaging, Inc. (Nasdaq:TPTH) which BD does not currently own. TriPath Imaging develops, manufactures, markets and sells innovative solutions to improve the clinical management of cancer, including detection, diagnosis, staging and treatment. The proposal was solicited by TriPath Imaging in connection with the culmination by TriPath Imaging of a process to explore strategic alternatives. BD's proposal states that it is conditioned upon, among other things, approval of the offer by the TriPath Imaging board of directors, the prompt negotiation of mutually acceptable definitive agreements, satisfactory completion of due diligence, and the obtaining of necessary regulatory approvals. Assuming that BD's proposal is accepted and definitive agreements are executed, it would be anticipated that the transaction would close during the first quarter of BD's 2007 fiscal year. BD and TriPath Imaging have participated in a collaboration to identify bio-markers for various cancer diagnostics since 2001, at which time BD acquired the approximately 6.5% equity interest that it currently holds and filed a Statement on Schedule 13G to reflect these holdings. The proposed acquisition of TriPath Imaging, which would be expected to be minimally dilutive to BD's fiscal 2007 earnings (excluding an anticipated charge for in-process research and development), fits strategically with BD's objective of accelerating and advancing its presence in the cancer diagnostics market. BD will provide guidance for fiscal 2007 during its fiscal fourth quarter earnings call on November 2, 2006. About BD BD, a leading global medical technology company that makes and sells medical devices, instrumented systems and reagents, is dedicated to improving people's health throughout the world.
