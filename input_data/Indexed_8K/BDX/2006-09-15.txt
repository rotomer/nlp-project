Other Events
 
On August 21, 2006, BD received a subpoena issued by the Attorney General of the State of Illinois which seeks documents and information relating to BD's participation as a member of Healthcare Research & Development Institute, LLC. ("HRDI"), a healthcare trade organization (an independent member of BD's board of directors, Gary Mecklenburg, also serves as the non-executive chairman of HRDI). The subpoena indicates that it was issued as part of an investigation into possible violations of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, Charitable Trust Act, and Solicitation for Charity Act. BD believes that its participation in HRDI complies fully with the law and has no additional information regarding the investigation at this time. BD intends to cooperate fully in responding to the subpoena.
