BD ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER AND FULL YEAR
 
Franklin Lakes, NJ (November 2, 2006)
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported record quarterly revenues of $1.488 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2006, representing an increase of 8 percent over the prior year period. This quarter's growth rate reflects the favorable impact on all segments from foreign currency translation, which overall is estimated to account for 2 percentage points of the growth.
 
For the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, BD reported record revenues of $5.835 billion, representing an increase of 8 percent over the prior year, which reflects an overall estimated 1 percent unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation that affected all segments.
 
"We are proud of our accomplishments during 2006 and enthusiastic about our outlook for 2007," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our revenue and earnings growth exceeded our expectations and give us continuing confidence that our strategy is sound and our implementation is disciplined. We remain committed to serving our customers with products that make a difference in healthcare, and we will continue to work diligently to deliver value to our shareholders."

On September 28, 2006, the Company announced a plan to exit the blood glucose monitoring ("BGM") market. As a result of this decision, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $63 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2006. This charge consists of $5 million related to estimated customer returns, $46 million associated with the write-off of inventory, related purchase commitments and long-lived assets, and $12 million related to severance and other exit costs.
 
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $809 million, representing an increase of 6 percent from the prior year period.

Included in BD Medical revenues for the quarter were international sales of safety-engineered products of $26 million, compared with $21 million in the prior year period.
 
For the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, total BD Medical segment revenues of $3.203 billion increased by 8 percent from the prior year.

Planned Acquisition of TriPath Imaging
On September 8, 2006 the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire the 93.5% of the outstanding shares of TriPath Imaging that BD does not currently own. The acquisition expands BD's presence in cancer diagnostics, which is a key element of the Company's strategy to drive revenue growth through innovation. We received U.S. antitrust clearance for this acquisition on October 27, 2006. Following the requisite approval by the TriPath Imaging shareholders, as well as other customary closing conditions, the acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of BD's first fiscal quarter 2007. As previously stated, the acquisition is expected to be minimally dilutive to BD's fiscal 2007 earnings (excluding an anticipated charge for in-process research and development) and is included in our estimated guidance discussed below.
 
Fiscal 2007 Outlook for Full Year
 
The following analysis of estimated diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full fiscal year identifies specified items that affect the comparability of results between periods. As illustrated in Table 2, the Company estimates that diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full fiscal year 2007 will be in the $3.69 to $3.75 range, representing an increase of approximately 12 to 14 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, of $3.28 for the fiscal year 2006.
 
 
Includes the minimally dilutive effect on estimated diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2007 relating to the operations of TriPath Imaging, which the Company expects to acquire by the end of the first fiscal quarter 2007. Does not include anticipated in-process research and development charge, which would be recorded upon closing of the acquisition.
