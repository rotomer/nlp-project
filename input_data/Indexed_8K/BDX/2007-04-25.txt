ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
 
On April 25, 2007, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the second fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2007. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as follows:
Revenues
. We present revenue growth rates at constant foreign exchange rates. We believe that
presenting revenue growth rates at constant foreign exchange rates allows investors to view the
underlying operating results of BD and of its segments without the impact of fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating comparisons to prior periods.
Selling and Administrative Expense
. We present selling and administrative expense, both alone
and as a percentage of revenues, for the second quarter and for the first six months of fiscal year
2006 after excluding the impact of insurance settlements occurring during the period. These
settlements caused reported selling and administrative expense to be lower than it otherwise would
have been for the period in which they occurred, although these settlements are not considered part
of ordinary operations by management. Accordingly, we believe that measures of selling and
administrative expense that are adjusted for the effects of these settlements are more indicative of
BD's underlying performance and assist investors in comparing BD's selling and administrative
expense for the period to other periods.
Research and Development Expense
. We present research and development expense, both alone
and as a percentage of revenues, for the first six months of fiscal year 2007 after excluding the
impact of the in-process research and development ("R&D") charge relating to the acquisition of
TriPath Imaging, Inc. ("TriPath"). We also present these measures for the second quarter and first
six months of fiscal year 2006 after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charge relating to
the acquisition of GeneOhm Sciences Inc. ("GeneOhm"). These noncash charges are not
considered by management to be part of ordinary operations and served to increase reported R&D
expense for the period in which they were incurred. Management believes that these adjusted
measures are more indicative of BD's R&D activities for the period presented. Management also
presents these adjusted measures in order to assist investors in comparing BD's R&D expense for
the period to other periods.
Operating Income
. We present BD's operating income, both alone and as a percentage of revenues,
for the first six months of fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D
charge relating to the TriPath acquisition. We also present these measures for the second quarter
and first six months of fiscal year 2006 after excluding the impact of insurance settlements and the
in-process R&D charge relating to the GeneOhm acquisition. These items affected reported
operating income for the period in which they occurred, but are not considered by management to
be part of ordinary operations. Accordingly, management believes that these adjusted measures of
operating income are more indicative of BD's underlying performance, and also allow investors to
better understand BD's comparative operating performance for the period presented.
Income Taxes/Effective Tax Rate
. We present income taxes and effective tax rate for the second
quarter and first six months of fiscal year 2006 after excluding the impact of insurance settlements.
These settlements caused our reported income tax expense and effective tax rate to be higher than
they otherwise would have been for the period in which they occurred, although these settlements
are not considered part of ordinary operations by management. Management believes that these
adjusted measures of income taxes are more indicative of BD's underlying results, and also allow
investors to better understand BD's comparative income tax expense and tax rate for the period
presented.
 
 
 
Income from Continuing Operations
. We present BD's income from continuing operations, both
alone and as a percentage of revenues, for the first six months of fiscal year 2007 after excluding
the impact of the in-process R&D charge relating to the TriPath acquisition. We also present BD's
income from continuing operations, both alone and as a percentage of revenues, for the second
quarter and first six months of fiscal year 2006 after excluding the impact of insurance settlements
and the in-process R&D charge relating to the GeneOhm acquisition. These items affected
reported income from continuing operations for the period in which they occurred, but are not
considered by management to be part of ordinary operations. Accordingly, management believes
that these adjusted measures of income from continuing operations are more indicative of BD's
underlying performance, and also allow investors to better understand BD's comparative income
from continuing operations for the period presented.
We present earnings per share from continuing operations for the first six months of fiscal year 2007 (and projected earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2007) after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charge relating to the TriPath acquisition. This charge caused (or will cause) reported earnings per share for the period to be lower than it otherwise would have been, although the charge is not considered by management to be part of ordinary operations. We believe that a measure of earnings per share that is adjusted for the impact of this charge is more indicative of BD's underlying performance and also allows investors to more easily compare BD's results for the period to other periods.
Earnings Per Share.
We also present earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal year 2006, the first six months of fiscal year 2006 and the full 2006 fiscal year after excluding the impact of insurance settlements and the in-process R&D charge relating to the GeneOhm acquisition. These items affected reported earnings per share for the period in which they occurred, but are not considered by management to be part of ordinary operations. Accordingly, management believes that these adjusted measures of earnings per share are more indicative of BD's underlying performance, and also allow investors to better understand BD's comparative performance for the period presented.
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.

BD ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR SECOND FISCAL QUARTER
Second-quarter earnings per share from continuing operations increase 12% to 92 cents,
excluding specified items
Raises guidance for full fiscal year 2007 earnings per share from continuing operations to
$3.76 to $3.80 from $3.71 to $3.77, excluding specified items
Franklin Lakes, NJ (April 25, 2007)
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported record quarterly revenues of $1.576 billion for the second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2007, representing an increase of 11 percent over the prior year period. This quarter's growth rate reflects the favorable impact on all segments from foreign currency translation, which overall is estimated to account for 3 percentage points of the increase in quarterly revenues.
"We are pleased with the strength of our second quarter results and outlook for fiscal 2007. BD's strategy of providing innovative solutions to global healthcare needs continues to fuel our growth," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our improving gross margin is providing the necessary resources to invest for the future. The combination of our strong operations, internal investments in research and development and recent acquisitions of GeneOhm and TriPath provides the basis for us to look to the future with confidence."
Analysis of Second Quarter and Six-Month Period of Fiscal Year 2007 and 2006 Earnings
Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 92 cents for the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The following analysis (Table 1) of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarters of fiscal 2007 and 2006 identifies specified items that affect comparability of results between periods. As illustrated, second quarter fiscal 2007 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 12 percent over comparable second quarter fiscal 2006 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 82 cents, which exclude specified items. For the six-month periods, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.89 for fiscal 2007, which exclude specified item, increased by 13 percent over comparable fiscal 2006 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.67, which exclude specified items.

(2)
Represents the effect on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 2 cents in each of the first and second quarter of fiscal 2006 related to proceeds received from insurance settlements associated with the Company's previously owned latex glove business.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $844 million, representing an increase of 10 percent from the prior year period. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2007, the BD Medical segment reported 10 percent revenue growth. Strong sales in the Pharmaceutical Systems unit continued to significantly contribute to the growth of the segment.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $473 million, representing an increase of 11 percent from the prior year's quarter, despite continued slow sales of flu testing products. This growth includes $27 million of revenues from TriPath, which was acquired at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The Preanalytical Systems unit of the segment reported revenue growth of 8 percent. Second quarter revenues in the Diagnostic Systems unit of the segment increased 15 percent, again including revenues from the TriPath acquisition. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2007, the BD Diagnostics segment reported 7 percent revenue growth.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $259 million, representing an increase of 13 percent from the prior year's quarter. Flow cytometry instrument and reagent sales, as well as sales of advanced bioprocessing products, contributed to growth. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2007, the BD Biosciences segment reported 12 percent revenue growth, resulting from continued strong sales of those same products.
Geographic Results
Second quarter revenues in the U.S. were $754 million, representing an increase of 11 percent over the prior year period and include $27 million of revenues from TriPath. Revenues outside the U.S. were $822 million, representing an increase of 10 percent over the prior year period. Approximately 5 percentage points of the increase resulted from the favorable impact of foreign currency translation.
For the six-month period ended March 31, 2007, revenues in the U.S. were $1.475 billion, representing an increase of 10 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $1.603 billion, representing an increase of 8 percent over the prior year period.
