ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.
 
As was previously reported by Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD"), bioMrieux SA has initiated an arbitration proceeding with the International Chamber of Commerce International Court of Arbitration in Paris, France, against GeneOhm Sciences Canada ("GeneOhm"), a subsidiary of BD. The arbitration relates to a sublicense agreement under which bioMrieux granted certain patent rights to GeneOhm relating to a method for the detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In the arbitration, bioMrieux alleges, among other things, that GeneOhm fraudulently induced bioMrieux into entering into the sublicense and assigned its rights in violation of the sublicense. bioMrieux is seeking monetary damages and to terminate the patent rights granted to GeneOhm under the sublicense agreement. The arbitration clause of the sublicense agreement provides that the arbitration will be held before a sole arbitrator, whose decision will be binding on both GeneOhm and bioMrieux. The loss of its rights under the sublicense with bioMrieux may adversely affect GeneOhm's ability to market its MRSA detection products. However, BD believes that there is no basis for bioMrieux to terminate the sublicense agreement and GeneOhm intends to vigorously defend its position in the arbitration proceedings.
 
Also as previously reported, BD received a letter from bioMrieux invoking the dispute resolution clause of a separate license agreement between BD and bioMrieux, under which bioMrieux grants patent rights to BD for certain licensed fields relating to BD's BACTEC products. In the letter, bioMrieux alleges that sales of BD's BACTEC products have been made in non-licensed fields and that such sales constitute a material breach of the license agreement. bioMrieux requests compensation for any non-licensed sales, as well as cessation of all future sales in non-licensed fields. BD believes there has been no material breach of the agreement and intends to follow the dispute resolution provisions to resolve the matter, while vigorously defending its position with respect to the alleged breach.
 
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
