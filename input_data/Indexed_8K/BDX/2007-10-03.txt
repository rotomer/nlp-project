Daniels Sharpsmart, Inc. v. Tyco International, (US) Inc., et. al.
In a separate matter, BD has been served with a qui tam complaint filed by a private party against BD in the United States District Court, Northern District of Texas, alleging violations of the Federal False Claims Act ("FCA") and similar Texas laws. Under the FCA, the United States Department of Justice, Civil Division has a certain period of time in which to decide whether to join the claim against BD as an additional plaintiff; if not, the private plaintiff is free to pursue the claim on its own. To BD's knowledge, no decision has yet been made by the Civil Division whether to join this claim. We believe that our business practices have complied with applicable laws and intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit.
