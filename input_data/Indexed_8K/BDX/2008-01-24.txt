The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as follows:
 
 
performance and also allow investors to more easily compare BD's results for the period to other periods.
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.

First-quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified item, increased 11% to $1.07
Raises guidance for full fiscal year 2008 earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, to a range of 11% to 13% from 10% to 12%
Franklin Lakes, NJ (January 24, 2008)
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported record quarterly revenues of $1.706 billion for the first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2007, representing an increase of 14 percent over the prior year period. This quarter's growth rate reflects the favorable impact on all segments from foreign currency translation, which overall is estimated to account for 6 percentage points of the growth.
"We are pleased with our strong start to fiscal 2008. Our BD Diagnostics and BD Biosciences segments led our revenue growth," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Disciplined expense management enables us to offset the challenges of raw material price increases and manufacturing start-up costs related to increasing capacity to meet growing demand."
Analysis of First Quarter Fiscal Year 2008 and 2007 Earnings
The following analysis (Table 1) of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarters of fiscal 2008 and 2007 identifies the specified item that affects comparability of results between periods. As illustrated, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.07 for the first fiscal quarter of 2008 increased by 11 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified item, of 96 cents for the first fiscal quarter of 2007.

Represents the effect on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of the in-process research and development charge recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 related to the TriPath acquisition.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $909 million, representing an increase of 10 percent over the prior year period. Pharmaceutical Systems and Diabetes Care products led revenue growth in the segment.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $523 million, representing an increase of 18 percent over the prior year period. Five percentage points of this growth is attributable to TriPath, which was acquired near the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2007. Sales of safety-engineered devices and molecular testing systems, including GeneOhm, also contributed to growth.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $274 million, representing an increase of 18 percent over the prior year period. Demand for research instruments as well as clinical and research reagents continued to be the primary growth drivers.
Geographic Results
First quarter revenues in the U.S. were $790 million, representing an increase of 10 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside the U.S. were $916 million, representing an increase of 17 percent over the prior year period, and reflect an estimated 11 percent favorable impact from foreign currency translation.
Fiscal 2008 Outlook for Full Year
The Company estimates that diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full fiscal year 2008 will increase approximately 11 to 13 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the 48 cents in-process research and development charge related to the TriPath and Plasso acquisitions, of $3.84 for the fiscal year 2007.
