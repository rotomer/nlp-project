ITEM 2.02      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
On July 24, 2008, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2008. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as follows:
Revenues
. We present international and total company revenue growth rates at constant foreign exchange rates. We believe that presenting revenue growth rates at constant foreign exchange rates allows investors to view the underlying operating results of BD and of its segments without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating comparisons to prior periods.
Operating Income
. We present BD's operating income, both alone and as a percentage of revenues, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process research and development ("R&D") charge relating to our acquisition of Plasso Technology, Ltd. ("Plasso"). We also present BD's operating income, both alone and as a percentage of revenues, for the first nine months of fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charges relating to our acquisition of Plasso and our acquisition of TriPath Imaging, Inc. ("TriPath"). These charges affected reported operating income for the periods presented, but are not considered by management to be part of ordinary operations. Accordingly, management believes that these adjusted measures of operating income are more indicative of BD's underlying performance, and allow investors to better understand BD's comparative operating performance for the periods presented.
Effective Tax Rate
. We present BD's effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charges relating to our acquisition of Plasso. We also present BD's effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charges relating to our acquisition of TriPath and Plasso. These charges, which are not considered part of ordinary operations by management and are not tax deductible, caused our effective tax rate for such periods to be higher than it otherwise would have been. Management believes that these adjusted measures of our effective tax rate are more indicative of BD's underlying results, and allow investors to better understand BD's comparative effective tax rate for such periods.
Income from Continuing Operations
. We present BD's income from continuing operations, both alone and as a percentage of revenues, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charge relating to our acquisition of Plasso. We also present BD's income from continuing operations, both alone and as a percentage of revenues, for the first nine months of fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charges relating to our acquisition of TriPath and Plasso. These charges affected reported income from continuing operations for the periods presented, but are not considered by management to be part of ordinary operations. Accordingly, management believes that these adjusted measures of income from continuing operations are more indicative of BD's underlying performance, and allow investors to better understand BD's comparative income from continuing operations for such periods.
Earnings Per Share
. We present BD's earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charge relating to our acquisition of Plasso. We also present earnings per share from continuing operations for the first nine months of fiscal year 2007 and for the full 2007 fiscal year after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charges relating to our acquisition of TriPath and Plasso. These charges caused reported earnings per share for such periods to be lower than they otherwise would have been, although these charges are not considered by management to be part of ordinary operations. We believe that measures of earnings per share that are adjusted for the impact of these charges are more indicative of BD's underlying performance and allow investors to more easily compare BD's results for the periods presented to other periods.
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.
 
 
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

News Release
 
Franklin Lakes, NJ (July 24, 2008)
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported record quarterly revenues of $1.868 billion for the third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2008, representing an increase of 14.5 percent over the prior year period. This quarter's revenue growth rate reflects the favorable impact on all segments from foreign currency translation, which overall is estimated to account for nearly 7 percentage points of the increase in quarterly revenues.
"We are pleased that all segments and regions, particularly Europe and Asia, contributed to solid revenue growth," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We are also pleased with our operating results, which in part, have enabled us to raise our earnings guidance once again despite continued pressure from increasing raw material costs."
Analyses of Third Quarter and Nine-Month Periods of Fiscal Year 2008 and 2007 Earnings
Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.18 for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and 95 cents for the third quarter of fiscal 2007. For the nine-month period ending June 30, 2008, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $3.34. For the nine-
month period ending June 30, 2007, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.38.
The following analysis (Table 1) of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the three-month and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, identifies the specified items that affect comparability of results between periods. As illustrated, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.18 for the third fiscal quarter of 2008 increased by 20 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the specified item, of 98 cents for the third fiscal quarter of 2007. For the nine-month periods, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $3.34 for fiscal 2008 increased by 17 percent over comparable fiscal 2007 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.86, which exclude the specified items.
 
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $1.016 billion, representing an
increase of 15 percent from the prior year period. Pharmaceutical Systems and Diabetes Care products

Geographic Results
Third quarter revenues in the U.S. were $798 million, representing an increase of 4 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside the U.S. were $1.069 billion, representing an increase of 24 percent over the prior year period, with approximately 13 percentage points of the increase resulting from the favorable impact of foreign currency translation.

Revenues outside of the U.S. were $2.948 billion, representing an increase of 20 percent over the prior year period, with approximately 11 percentage points of the increase resulting from the favorable impact from foreign currency translation.
Fiscal 2008 Outlook for Full Year
The Company raised its guidance for full fiscal year 2008 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to approximately 16 percent from approximately 13 to 14 percent over adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $3.84 for the full fiscal year 2007. Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full fiscal year 2007 were $3.36, which included 48 cents for in-process research and development charges related to the TriPath and Plasso acquisitions. Excluding these charges, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations
for the full fiscal year 2007 were $3.84.
