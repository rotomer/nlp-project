OTHER EVENTS.
     In (Case Number: C 04-02123 WDA, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California)), on August 8, 2008, the jury ruled in favor of Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") and determined that Abbott Laboratories' patent is not valid.
Therasense, Inc. and Abbott Laboratories v. Nova Biomedical Corporation and Becton, Dickinson and Company
This was the last of four patents asserted by the plaintiffs against BD relating to BD's discontinued blood glucose monitoring business. The Court had previously ruled in BD's favor
regarding the other three patents asserted by Therasense and Abbott Laboratories in this case. We anticipate that the plaintiffs will appeal the judgment in this case.
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
