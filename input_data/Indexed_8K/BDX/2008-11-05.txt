On November 5, 2008, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ending September 30, 2008. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as follows:
Revenues
. We present international and total company revenue growth rates at constant foreign exchange
rates. We believe that presenting revenue growth rates at constant foreign exchange rates allows investors
to view the underlying operating results of BD and of its segments without the impact of fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating comparisons to prior periods.
Operating Income
. We present BD's operating income, both alone and as a percentage of revenues, for
fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process research and development ("R&D") charges
relating to our acquisitions of Plasso Technology, Ltd. ("Plasso") and TriPath Imaging, Inc. ("TriPath"). These charges affected reported operating income for the 2007 fiscal year, but are not considered by
management to be part of ordinary operations. Accordingly, management believes that these adjusted
measures of operating income are more indicative of BD's underlying performance for the 2007 fiscal year,
and allow investors to more easily compare BD's performance for the period to other periods.
Effective Tax Rate
. We present BD's effective tax rate for the 2007 fiscal year after excluding the impact
of the in-process R&D charges relating to our acquisition of TriPath and Plasso. These charges, which are
not considered part of ordinary operations by management and are not tax deductible, caused our effective
tax rate for the 2007 fiscal year to be higher than it otherwise would have been. Management believes that
this adjusted measure of our effective tax rate is more indicative of BD's underlying results, and allows
investors to more easily compare BD's effective tax rate for the 2007 fiscal year to other periods.
Income from Continuing Operations
. We present BD's income from continuing operations, both alone and
as a percentage of revenues, for fiscal year 2007 after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charges
relating to our acquisition of TriPath and Plasso. These charges affected reported income from continuing
operations for the 2007 fiscal year, but are not considered by management to be part of ordinary operations.
Accordingly, management believes that these adjusted measures of income from continuing operations are
more indicative of BD's underlying performance for the 2007 fiscal year, and allow investors to more
easily compare BD's performance for the period to other periods.
Earnings Per Share
. We present BD's earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2007
after excluding the impact of the in-process R&D charges relating to our acquisition of TriPath and Plasso. These charges caused reported earnings per share for the 2007 fiscal year to be lower than it otherwise
would have been, although these charges are not considered by management to be part of ordinary
operations. We believe that a measure of earnings per share that is adjusted for the impact of these charges
is more indicative of BD's underlying performance and allows investors to more easily compare BD's
results for the 2007 fiscal year to other periods.
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.
 
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Franklin Lakes, NJ (November 5, 2008)
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX) today reported quarterly revenues of $1.836 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2008, representing an increase of 11 percent over the prior year period. This quarter's growth rate reflects the favorable impact on all segments from foreign currency translation, which overall is estimated to account for 5 percentage points of the increase in quarterly revenues.
For the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, BD reported record revenues of $7.156 billion, representing an increase of 13 percent over the prior year, which reflects an overall estimated 6 percent favorable impact from foreign currency translation that affected all segments.
"We are pleased to report another strong year for BD, one in which we exceeded our strategic and financial goals despite a challenging business environment," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "All segments contributed to our success and growth. Implementation of disciplined spending controls enabled us to expand our operating margins as we continued to make significant capital and R&D investments to support our innovation strategy."
Fourth Quarter Earnings and Analysis of Full Fiscal Year 2008 and 2007 Earnings
Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.13 for the fourth quarter increased by 15 percent over reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 98 cents for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2007.
For the twelve-month period ending September 30, 2008, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $4.46. The following analysis (Table 1) of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the twelve-month periods ended September 30, 2008 and 2007 identifies specified items that affect the comparability of results between periods. As illustrated, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.46 for fiscal 2008 increased by 16 percent over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items, of $3.84 for fiscal 2007.
The Company estimates that reported revenues for the full fiscal year 2009 will increase approximately 1 to 2 percent. This performance reflects unfavorable foreign currency translation, based on current exchange rates, of an estimated 5 to 6 percentage points. The Company expects diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full fiscal year 2009 to increase approximately 8 to 10 percent over reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.46 for the fiscal year 2008.
(1)
Represents the effect on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of the in-process research and development ("IPR&D") charges recorded in fiscal 2007 related to the Plasso and TriPath acquisitions.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $953 million, representing an increase of 10 percent from the prior year period. Pharmaceutical Systems and Diabetes Care products led revenue growth in the segment. For the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, the BD Medical segment reported 11 percent revenue growth to $3.801 billion.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $553 million, representing an increase of 11 percent from the prior year's quarter. Sales of safety-engineered devices, cancer diagnostics products and infectious disease testing systems contributed to revenue growth. For the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, the BD Diagnostics segment reported revenue growth of 13 percent to $2.160 billion.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $329 million, representing an increase of 16 percent from the prior year's quarter. Demand for clinical and research instruments and reagents were the primary growth drivers. For the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, the BD Biosciences segment reported 16 percent revenue growth to $1.195 billion.
Geographic Results
Fourth quarter revenues in the U.S. were $813 million, representing an increase of 3 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside the U.S. were $1.023 billion, representing an increase of 19 percent over the prior year period, with approximately 9 percentage points of the increase resulting from the favorable impact from foreign currency translation.
For the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, revenues in the U.S. were $3.185 billion, representing an increase of 5 percent over the prior year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $3.971 billion, representing an increase of 19 percent over the prior year period, with approximately 11 percentage points of the increase resulting from the favorable impact from foreign currency translation.
Fiscal 2009 Outlook for Full Year
 
This earnings estimate reflects anticipated operating margin improvement, which more than offsets the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.
