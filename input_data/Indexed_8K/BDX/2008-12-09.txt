Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") previously announced that John R. Considine, the Vice Chairman of BD, had planned to remain as a member of BD's Board of Directors until his planned retirement following BD's 2010 Annual Meeting. However, on December 4, 2008, Mr. Considine indicated that he plans to retire earlier, although no date has been set.

Mr. Considine will continue to serve as Vice Chairman in an executive officer capacity until his retirement, and will, among other things, oversee the transition of responsibilities to David V. Elkins, who became BD's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer on December 1, 2008.
