Item 8.01 Other Events.
     As previously reported, on April 27, 2009, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") entered into a settlement agreement with certain purchaser plaintiffs (including BD's distributors) in the antitrust class actions consolidated in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey under the caption "". The settlement agreement provided for, among other things, the payment by BD of $45 million in exchange for a release by all potential class members of the direct purchaser claims under federal antitrust laws related to the products and acts enumerated in the complaint, and a dismissal of the case with prejudice, insofar as it relates to direct purchaser claims. On September 30, 2010, the court issued an order denying a motion to approve the settlement agreement, ruling that the hospital plaintiffs, and not the distributor plaintiffs, are the direct purchasers entitled to pursue damages under the federal antitrust laws for certain sales of BD products. The settlement agreement currently remains in effect, subject to certain termination provisions, and the court's order may be subject to appellate review. Accordingly, BD is not adjusting the provision it recognized for the settlement agreement in the second quarter of fiscal year 2009.
