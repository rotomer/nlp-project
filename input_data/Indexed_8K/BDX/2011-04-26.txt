ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On April 26, 2011, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for its second fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2011. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP measures"), as follows:
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.
 
ITEM 9.01 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: April 26, 2011

 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX), a leading global medical technology company, today reported quarterly revenues of $1.922 billion for the second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2011, representing an increase of 6.8 percent from the prior-year period. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, revenue increased 4.6 percent, despite an unfavorable comparison to the prior year of about 2.3 percentage points due to strong sales related to the H1N1 flu pandemic, supplemental spending in Japan and stimulus spending in the U.S. in fiscal year 2010.
Franklin Lakes, NJ (April 26, 2011)
"We are pleased with our solid results this quarter, which were in line with our expectations," said Edward J. Ludwig, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We continued the increased pace of our R&D spending and made strategic investments, such as our acquisition of Accuri Cytometers, demonstrating our commitment to driving revenue growth through innovation."
Update on Impact of Japan Earthquake and Tsunami
Order volumes for BD products in Japan have now returned to normal levels. The Company's manufacturing plant in Fukushima sustained some earthquake-related damage, but the prepared plated media manufacturing lines were recently restarted, and manufacturing of BD Hypak Prefillable Syringes is expected to resume during the third fiscal quarter 2011. BD's Fukushima distribution center and an additional distribution center near Tokyo are in operation. The unfavorable impact of these events on the Company's revenues in the second fiscal quarter was less than $10 million. For the full fiscal year 2011, the Company anticipates these events to have an aggregate unfavorable impact of $10 to $20 million on revenues, or about $0.05 per share, which has been incorporated into its fiscal year 2011 guidance.

Second Quarter and Six-Month Fiscal 2011 Operating Results
Reported diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.38, compared with $1.18 in the prior-year period, representing a 16.9 percent increase. The prior-year period included a non-cash charge of $8.9 million, or $0.04 per share, related to healthcare reform impacting Medicare Part D reimbursements. Excluding that item, earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 13.1 percent, compared with adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.22 in the prior-year period, or 7.4 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
For the six-month period ending March 31, 2011, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.72, compared with $2.43 in the prior-year period. Excluding the aforementioned charge, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 10.1 percent, compared with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.47 in the prior-year period, or 5.3 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $981 million, representing an increase of 6.5 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 4.9 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Revenues reflected strong sales of Diabetes Care and Pharmaceutical Systems products. The segment's revenues also reflected an unfavorable comparison to the prior year of about 1.6 percentage points due to strong sales related to the H1N1 flu pandemic in fiscal year 2010. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2011, BD Medical revenues increased 0.8 percent, or 0.1 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $605 million, representing an increase of 8.9 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 6.5 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Revenues reflected solid growth in Preanalytical Systems safety-engineered products and strong growth in Diagnostic Systems infectious disease platforms. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2011, BD Diagnostics revenues increased 4.9 percent, or 3.6 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $335 million, representing an increase of 4.1 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 0.4 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Segment revenue growth was negatively impacted by about 12 percentage points due to certain factors. About 8 percentage points of the impact was due to an unfavorable comparison resulting from strong sales related to supplemental spending in Japan and stimulus spending in the U.S. in fiscal year 2010, and about 3 percentage points resulted from the effects of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Segment growth was driven primarily by instrument and reagent sales in the Cell Analysis unit. Discovery Labware revenues in the U.S. were negatively impacted by weakness in core consumables due to lower pharmaceutical spending and academic sector sales. For the six-month
2
 
period ended March 31, 2011, BD Biosciences revenues increased by 3.9 percent, or 1.9 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Geographic Results
Second quarter revenues in the U.S. were $829 million, representing an increase of 4.7 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $1.093 billion, representing an increase of 8.5 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 4.6 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Revenues reflected continued strength in emerging markets, which was partially offset by weakened demand in Western Europe due to challenging macroeconomic conditions. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2011, revenues in the U.S. were $1.658 billion, representing an increase of 0.8 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $2.106 billion, representing an increase of 4.1 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 2.1 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Fiscal Year 2011 Outlook
The Company is raising its reported revenue guidance for the full fiscal year 2011 to an increase of approximately 5 to 6 percent compared with fiscal year 2010, due to an expected favorable currency impact. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, the Company is lowering its revenue guidance to an increase of about 3.5 percent versus its previous guidance of about 4 percent, mainly due to lower than expected sales in Western Europe.
The Company is raising its previous guidance for reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2011 by about $0.10 per share to a range of $5.55 to $5.65, an increase of approximately 13 to 15 percent over fiscal year 2010. This revised guidance reflects the anticipated effects of favorable currency and operating efficiencies, partially offset by higher resin costs and the negative impact of the Japan earthquake and tsunami. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2011 are expected to increase 12 to 14 percent over adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.94, excluding the specified item, for fiscal year 2010. The specified item represents the aforementioned 2010 non-cash charge of $0.04 per share related to healthcare reform. On a currency-neutral basis, the Company expects diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to increase about 10 percent over adjusted diluted earnings per share in the prior-year period.
