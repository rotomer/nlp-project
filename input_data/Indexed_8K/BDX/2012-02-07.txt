ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On February 7, 2012, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for its first fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2011. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP measures"), as follows:
 
 
 
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.

    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX), a leading global medical technology company, today reported quarterly revenues of $1.888 billion for the first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2011, representing an increase of 2.5 percent from the prior-year period, or 2.4 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Franklin Lakes, NJ (February 7, 2012)
"We are pleased with our solid start to fiscal year 2012 given the challenging macroeconomic climate," said Vincent A. Forlenza, Chief Executive Officer and President. "Our operating results reflect our increased investments in high-growth areas. We will continue to drive efficiency throughout the Company and we remain committed to delivering value to our customers and shareholders."
First Quarter Earnings
As expected, reported diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.21, compared with $1.35 in the prior-year period, representing a 10.4 percent decrease. This decline was due to difficult pricing comparisons, higher raw material costs and higher expenses from recent acquisitions. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, diluted earnings per share for the first quarter decreased by 9.6 percent. For the quarter, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations included an approximate $0.04 tax benefit primarily relating to various tax settlements in multiple jurisdictions. This benefit was reflected in our previous full fiscal year 2012 guidance.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $950 million, representing an increase of 2.6 percent compared with the prior-year period, on both a reported and a currency-neutral basis. The segment's revenue growth reflects solid sales in the Diabetes Care unit and international safety-engineered products.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $621 million, representing an increase of 3.2 percent compared with the prior-year period, or an increase of 3.3 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. The segment's growth was primarily driven by Preanalytical Systems safety-engineered products, and solid sales in Women's Health and Cancer.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $317 million, representing an increase of 0.9 percent compared with the prior-year period, or an increase of 0.3 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Segment growth was primarily driven by clinical reagent sales in the Cell Analysis unit.
Geographic Results
First quarter revenues in the U.S. of $829 million were flat when compared with the prior-year period, due to a challenging research spending environment and difficult pricing comparisons. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $1.059 billion, representing an increase of 4.5 percent compared with the prior-year period, or an increase of 4.4 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. International revenues reflected continued strength in emerging markets and strong sales of safety-engineered products.
Fiscal 2012 Outlook for Full Year
We are reaffirming our previously communicated revenue growth guidance of 2 to 4 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. The Company estimates reported revenue growth for the full fiscal year 2012 to be about flat versus our previously disclosed revenue growth guidance of 1 to 3 percent. The Company expects reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2012 to be between $5.60 and $5.70 which reflects the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar versus our previously disclosed guidance of $5.75 to $5.85. The Company uses recent spot rates for all foreign currencies when projecting reported growth rates and earnings per share. In line with our previously disclosed guidance, the Company plans to repurchase, subject to market conditions, $1.5 billion of its common stock in fiscal year 2012.
