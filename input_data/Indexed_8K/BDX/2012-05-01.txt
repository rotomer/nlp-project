ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On May 1, 2012, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for its second fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2012. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP measures"), as follows:
 
 
 
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.

    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX), a leading global medical technology company, today reported quarterly revenues of $1.991 billion for the second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2012, representing an increase of 3.6 percent from the prior-year period, or 4.6 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Franklin Lakes, NJ (May 1, 2012)
"We are very pleased with our second quarter results. We posted solid revenue growth led by our BD Medical and BD Diagnostics segments, despite continuing challenges in the U.S. in our BD Biosciences segment," said Vincent A. Forlenza, Chief Executive Officer and President. "We remain committed to our strategy of investing and innovating for growth, both organically and through acquisitions such as KIESTRA Lab Automation."
Agreement to Sell Discovery Labware Unit, Excluding Advanced Bioprocessing
In April 2012, the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell its BD Biosciences - Discovery Labware unit, excluding its Advanced Bioprocessing platform. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of calendar year 2012, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including consultations and regulatory approvals. For the full fiscal year 2012, revenues and earnings per share associated with this asset group are estimated at $235 million and $0.23 to $0.27, respectively. The Company expects to record a gain on the sale at the time the transaction is completed.
Second Quarter and Six-Month Fiscal 2012 Operating Results
As expected, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter were $1.38, or flat compared with the prior-year period. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter increased by 2.9 percent.
For the six-month period ending March 31, 2012, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.59, compared with $2.72 in the prior-year period. This represents a decrease of 4.8 percent, or 3.3 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $1.021 billion, representing an increase of 4.1 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 5.3 percent on a currency-neutral basis. The segment's revenue growth reflected strong sales in the Pharmaceutical Systems and Diabetes Care
units and solid sales in the Medical Surgical Systems unit. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2012, BD Medical revenues increased 3.3 percent, or 4.0 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $630 million, representing an increase of 4.1 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 5.0 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. The segment's growth was primarily driven by strong sales in the Preanalytical Systems unit and solid growth in Women's Health and Cancer. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2012, BD Diagnostics revenues increased 3.6 percent, or 4.1 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $340 million, representing an increase of 1.3 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 1.7 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Segment growth was primarily driven by clinical reagent sales in the Cell Analysis unit and strong emerging market sales as overall segment growth continues to be negatively affected by weakness in the U.S. research market. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2012, BD Biosciences revenues increased 1.1 percent, or 1.0 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
Geographic Results
Second quarter revenues in the U.S. were $848 million, representing an increase of 2.2 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $1.143 billion, representing an increase of 4.6 percent compared with the prior-year period, or an increase of 6.3 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. International revenues reflected continued strength in emerging markets and strong sales of safety-engineered products. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2012, revenues in the U.S. were $1.676 billion, representing an increase of 1.1 percent compared with
the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $2.202 billion, representing an increase of 4.5 percent when compared with the prior-year period, or 5.4 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Fiscal 2012 Outlook for Full Year
The Company is raising its previous guidance for reported revenue growth for the full fiscal year 2012 from about flat to be between 1 to 2 percent. This reflects the anticipated effects of favorable currency translation. On a currency-neutral basis, the Company is raising the lower end of its previous revenue growth guidance of 2 to 4 percent, to 3 to 4 percent. The Company is raising reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2012 from $5.60 to $5.70 to be between $5.68 and $5.73, and plans to repurchase, subject to market conditions, $1.5 billion of its common stock in fiscal year 2012.
