ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On August 2, 2012, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for its third fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2012. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP measures"), as follows:
 
 
 
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.

 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX), a leading global medical technology company, today reported quarterly revenues of $1.981 billion for the third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2012, representing an increase of 1.5 percent from the prior-year period, or 4.9 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Franklin Lakes, NJ (August 2, 2012)
"We are very pleased with our third quarter results," said Vincent A. Forlenza, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President. "As we anticipated, our revenue and earnings growth improved this quarter, demonstrating that our strategy implementation is on track and in line with our previously communicated expectations."
Update on Agreement to Sell Discovery Labware Unit, Excluding Advanced Bioprocessing
In April 2012, the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell its BD Biosciences - Discovery Labware unit, excluding its Advanced Bioprocessing platform. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of calendar year 2012, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including consultations and regulatory approvals. The results of operations associated with this disposal group have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all quarters and years referred to in this release.
As illustrated on page 3 of the attached financial tables, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $1.59 less the $0.07 from discontinued operations resulted in earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.52.
Also included for reference in the attached financial tables are the Company's Consolidated Income Statements reflecting the reclassification change of the Discovery Labware disposal group to discontinued operations, for the first two quarters of fiscal year 2012 and for all periods in fiscal year 2011.
Third Quarter and Nine-Month Fiscal 2012 Operating Results
Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter were $1.52, representing an increase of 5.6 percent over the prior-year period. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter increased by 9.7 percent.
For the nine-month period ending June 30, 2012, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $3.95, representing a decrease of 1.7 percent over the prior- year period. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 1.0 percent for this period.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $1.070 billion, representing an increase of 2.4 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 6.4 percent on a currency-neutral basis. The segment's revenue growth reflected strong sales and favorable comparisons in the Diabetes Care and Pharmaceutical Systems units. For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2012, BD Medical revenues increased 3.0 percent, or 4.8 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $642 million, representing an increase of 1.7 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 4.7 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. The segment's growth was primarily driven
by solid sales of Preanalytical Systems safety-engineered products and strong sales in the Women's Health and Cancer platform. For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2012, BD Diagnostics revenues increased 3.0 percent, or 4.3 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $268 million, representing a decrease of 2.7 percent compared with the prior-year period. On a currency-neutral basis, revenues increased by 0.2 percent. Segment results continue to be negatively affected by weakness in the U.S. research market. For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2012, BD Biosciences revenues increased 0.2 percent, or 1.3 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
Geographic Results
Third quarter revenues in the U.S. were $837 million, representing an increase of 1.1 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $1.144 billion, representing an increase of 1.7 percent compared with the prior-year period, or an increase of 7.8 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. International revenues reflected continued strength in emerging markets and strong sales of safety-engineered products. For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2012, revenues in the U.S. were $2.464 billion, representing an increase of 1.3 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $3.277 billion, representing an increase of 3.6 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 6.4 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Fiscal 2012 Outlook for Full Year
The Company expects reported revenue growth for the full fiscal year 2012 to be about 1 percent versus its previously disclosed guidance of 1 to 2 percent. This reflects the anticipated effects of unfavorable currency translation. On a currency-neutral basis, the Company is raising the lower end of its previously disclosed guidance of 3 to 4 percent to about 4 percent. The Company expects reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full fiscal year 2012 to be between $5.33 and $5.38. This reflects the reclassification of the Discovery Labware unit as discontinued operations and the anticipated effects of unfavorable currency translation. On a currency-neutral basis, the Company reaffirms its previously disclosed diluted earnings per share growth guidance of 4 to 5 percent, which includes the estimated impact of our recently announced agreement to acquire Safety Syringes, Inc.
