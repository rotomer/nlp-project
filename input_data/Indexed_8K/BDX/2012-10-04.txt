In a decision dated September 28, 2012, the District Court for the Southern District of California issued a decision on pre-trial summary judgment motions in . The court ruled that some of Gen-Probe's asserted patent claims are infringed, but other claims are not infringed, thus reducing from six to four the number of patents to be contested at the trial (which is scheduled to begin on December 4, 2012) and significant defense issues relating to patent invalidity, inequitable conduct and standing, remain to be adjudicated. This decision does not change the Company's views and it continues to believe that it has meritorious defenses to this litigation.
