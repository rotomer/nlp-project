ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On November 7, 2012, Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") issued a press release announcing its financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ending September 30, 2012. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP measures"), as follows:
 
 
We also present our diluted EPS for fiscal year 2011 after eliminating the non-cash charge resulting from the discontinuance of a research program within our Diagnostic Systems unit. This charge is not considered by management to be part of our ordinary operations. We believe this measure of EPS, adjusted for the impact of this cost, is more indicative of BD's underlying performance for fiscal year 2011, and allows investors to better assess our EPS performance for fiscal year 2012.
We also present our EPS growth for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 and for the full 2012 fiscal year (using adjusted EPS, as described in the two preceding paragraphs) after eliminating the effect of foreign currency translation. We believe that eliminating the effect of foreign currency translation allows investors to better understand the underlying operating results of BD and facilitates comparisons to prior periods.
We also present estimated EPS for fiscal year 2013 after eliminating the estimated impact of foreign currency translation and the estimated impact of the medical device excise tax that will go into effect during the fiscal year under the U.S. healthcare reform law. Eliminating the effect of foreign currency translation allows investors to better understand the anticipated underlying performance of BD and assess BD's earnings guidance relative to prior periods. Eliminating the impact of the medical device excise tax also allows investors to compare BD's 2013 guidance to prior periods as the tax will be in effect for the first time in 2013.
 
BD's management uses each of these non-GAAP measures in its own evaluation of BD's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.
BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis, as they provide additional insight into BD's financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD's underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD's underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability.
Non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD's management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD's net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD's results.

BD ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR 2012 FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER AND FULL YEAR
 
 
 
 BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX), a leading global medical technology company, today reported quarterly revenues of $1.967 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2012, representing a decrease of 1.1 percent from the prior-year period, or an increase of 4.7 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Franklin Lakes, NJ (November 7, 2012)
For the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, BD reported revenues of $7.708 billion, representing an increase of 1.6 percent over the prior-year period or 4.3 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
"We are proud of our solid finish to 2012," said Vincent A. Forlenza, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President. "Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, we delivered on our financial and operating goals while continuing our ongoing investments in geographic expansion, new product platforms and strategic acquisitions. We believe we are well positioned to succeed and will continue to focus on our strategy of investing and innovating for growth. We are confident in our outlook for fiscal year 2013 and remain committed to delivering value to our customers and shareholders."
Sale of Discovery Labware Unit, Excluding Advanced Bioprocessing
In April 2012, the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell its BD Biosciences - Discovery Labware unit, excluding its Advanced Bioprocessing platform, to Corning Incorporated. The results of operations associated with this disposal group have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all quarters and years referred to in this release. The transaction was completed on October 31, 2012 and the Company will record a gain within discontinued operations in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013.
Fourth Quarter and Analysis of the Full Fiscal Year 2012 and 2011 Earnings
Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter were $1.35, representing an increase of 4.7 percent over the prior-year period. Current quarter results included a charge of $20 million, or $0.07 per share from continuing operations, resulting from primarily non-cash pension settlements. The prior-year period results included a non-cash charge of $9 million, or $0.03 per
share from continuing operations, resulting from the discontinuance of a research program within the Diagnostic Systems unit. Excluding these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 7.6 percent to $1.42, compared with $1.32 in the prior-year period. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter increased by 15.2 percent.
For the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $5.30, representing a decrease of 0.2 percent over the prior-year period. Excluding the aforementioned charges of $0.06 per share from continuing operations in fiscal year 2012, and $0.03 per share from continuing operations in fiscal year 2011, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 0.8 percent to $5.37, compared with $5.33 in the prior-year period. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fiscal year increased 4.7 percent. On a full year basis, the charge of $20 million, or $0.06 per share from continuing operations, differs from the charge in the fourth quarter of $0.07 per share from continuing operations due to the number of average shares outstanding between the fourth quarter and full year.
Segment Results
In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $1.049 billion, representing a decrease of 0.5 percent compared with the prior-year period, or an increase of 5.9 percent on a currency-neutral basis. The segment's revenue growth reflected strong sales across all three business units. For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2012, BD Medical revenues increased 2.1 percent, or 5.1 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
In the BD Diagnostics segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $645 million, representing an increase of 0.5 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 5.1 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. The segment's growth was primarily driven by solid sales of Preanalytical Systems safety-engineered products and strong sales in the Diagnostic Systems unit, aided by the recent acquisition of KIESTRA. For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2012, BD Diagnostics revenues increased 2.3 percent, or 4.5 percent on a currency-neutral basis.
In the BD Biosciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $273 million, representing a decrease of 6.3 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 0.7 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. Segment results continue to be negatively affected by weakness in the U.S. research market. For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2012, BD Biosciences revenues decreased by 1.5 percent. On a foreign currency-neutral basis, revenues increased by 0.7 percent.
Geographic Results
Fourth quarter revenues in the U.S. were $824 million, representing an increase of 1.2 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $1.143 billion, representing a decrease of 2.6 percent compared with the prior-year period, or an increase of 7.1 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. International revenues reflected continued strength in emerging markets and strong sales of safety-engineered products. For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2012, revenues in the U.S. were $3.288 billion, representing an increase of 1.2 percent compared with the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $4.421 billion, representing an increase of 1.9 percent compared with the prior-year period, or 6.6 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.
Fiscal 2013 Outlook for Full Year
The Company estimates that reported revenues for the full fiscal year 2013 will increase 2 to 3 percent, or about 3.5 to 4.5 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. The Company expects reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full fiscal year 2013 to be between $5.58 and $5.64. On a currency-neutral basis, the Company expects diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to grow 7 to 8 percent, or 10 to 11 percent excluding the impact of the medical device tax that goes into effect in January 2013 under the U.S. healthcare reform law. The Company also plans to repurchase, subject to market conditions, about $500 million of its common stock in 2013.
