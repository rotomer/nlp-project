EXHIBIT 99 [FORTUNE BRANDS LOGO] NEWS RELEASE ---------------------------------------------------------------- Fortune Brands, Inc., 300 Tower Parkway, Lincolnshire, IL 60069 CONTACT: MEDIA RELATIONS: INVESTOR RELATIONS: CLARKSON HINE ANTHONY J. DIAZ (847) 484-4415 (847) 484-4410 FORTUNE BRANDS BOOSTS EARNINGS TARGETS COMPANY NOW TARGETING EPS ABOVE RANGE OF ANALYSTS' ESTIMATES FOR BOTH SECOND QUARTER AND FULL YEAR Lincolnshire, IL, June 13, 2002 - Fortune Brands, Inc. (NYSE: FO), a leading consumer brands company, today announced that it has raised its earnings targets for the second quarter and for the full year. "The second quarter is shaping up to be another strong double-digit earnings growth quarter for Fortune Brands, with every one of our businesses performing at or above expectations," said Fortune Brands Chairman & CEO Norm Wesley. "Sales for our leading consumer brands are trending higher than we expected, with particularly strong results in the kitchen and bath segment. Our solid top-line growth, combined with the immediate success of our Omega cabinets acquisition and the sustained benefit of our ABSOLUT-Jim Beam joint venture, gives us the confidence to raise our quarterly earnings target for the second time and to boost our outlook for the full year." Wall Street securities analysts currently estimate that the company will earn between 82 and 85 cents per diluted share in the second quarter versus the 64 cents it earned before one-time gains a year ago. The analysts' range for full-year performance is currently $3.04 to $3.12 per diluted share versus the $2.41 Fortune Brands earned before one-time gains in 2001. "Based on the strength of our business in April, May and the start of June, we're targeting second quarter performance to be at least two cents above the top of the range of analysts' current estimates, which would result in diluted EPS of 87 cents or more for the quarter. While economic uncertainty remains, we're also raising our target for full-year performance above the top of the range of analysts' current estimates for 2002," said Wesley. "Fortune Brands is on track to deliver strong double-digit earnings growth in the second quarter and for the full year, even excluding the benefit of lower goodwill amortization," Wesley added. The company has previously announced that the new accounting standards for goodwill will result in a second quarter EPS benefit of 8 cents and a full-year benefit of 31 cents. "Even excluding this benefit and one-time items, meeting our new full-year earnings target would result in diluted EPS growth of 17% or more for 2002." (more) www.fortunebrands.com
