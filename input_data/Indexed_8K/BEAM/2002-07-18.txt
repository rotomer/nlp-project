EXHIBIT 99 [FORTUNE BRANDS, INC. LOGO] NEWS RELEASE NEWS RELEASE NEWS RELEASE CONTACT: MEDIA RELATIONS: INVESTOR RELATIONS: CLARKSON HINE ANTHONY J. DIAZ (847) 484-4415 (847) 484-4410 FORTUNE BRANDS REPORTS RECORD SECOND QUARTER RESULTS - - DILUTED EPS GROWS TO 89 CENTS, UP 39% BEFORE NET GAIN FROM ONE-TIME ITEMS - - CABINETS & LEADING CONSUMER BRANDS DRIVE STRONG TOP-LINE GROWTH - - HIGH-RETURN STRATEGIC INITIATIVES ADD TO BROAD-BASED PROFIT INCREASE Lincolnshire, IL, July 18, 2002 - Fortune Brands, Inc. (NYSE: FO), a leading consumer brands company, today reported record results for the second quarter of 2002. Diluted earnings per share grew to 89 cents before a net gain from one-time items, up 39% from 64 cents a year ago. Excluding a previously announced 8-cents-per-share benefit from the new goodwill accounting standards, diluted EPS was 27% higher. Including a one-time after-tax net gain of $58.4 million resulting from a tax refund that exceeded restructuring and non-recurring charges related to the previously announced repositioning of the office products business, net income was $196.9 million, or $1.27 per diluted share. Fortune Brands' results reflect broad-based operational strength in the quarter, with especially robust demand for the company's Aristokraft, Schrock and newly acquired Omega kitchen and bath cabinets, plus strong performance for leading consumer brands including Moen, Titleist and Jim Beam. In addition to strong top-line growth, operating profit and earnings per share benefited from improved margins, positive operating leverage in the home products business, the continued success of the high-return Jim Beam-ABSOLUT distribution alliance, ongoing cost containment, significant improvements in working capital management and lower interest expense. On a comparable basis, sales grew 5% and operating profit increased 11%. Comparable results exclude the impact of the Omega cabinets acquisition, the divestiture of the UK-based Scotch business, excise taxes, favorable foreign exchange and June 2001 sales of ABSOLUT vodka recorded on an interim basis. Financial highlights include: - - Record sales, +8% to $1.51 billion (+5% on a comparable basis) - - Record operating profit, +16% to $251.4 million (+11% comparable) - - Record diluted EPS, +39% to 89 cents before net gains from one-time items - - Return on equity up 245 basis points to more than 21% - - Year-to-date share repurchases total 1.8 million shares (MORE) WWW.FORTUNEBRANDS.COM
FORTUNE BRANDS REPORTS RECORD SECOND QUARTER RESULTS, PAGE 2 "At a time when investors are searching for reliable earnings, consistent growth and increasing returns, Fortune Brands delivered once again," said Fortune Brands chairman & chief executive officer Norm Wesley. "Our strategy delivered broad-based growth in the second quarter as every one of our businesses generated underlying profit increases of 7% or more. Our continuous brand investments paid off in strong top-line growth, and the success of our strategic initiatives - including the Jim Beam-ABSOLUT alliance, the Omega cabinets acquisition and our office products repositioning - drove profits even higher." OUTLOOK FOR THIRD QUARTER AND FULL YEAR "We're upbeat about our prospects for the second half of 2002, though uncertainty remains in the global economies," said Wesley. "The strength of our consumer brands and the success of our strategy position Fortune Brands well to deliver solid double-digit EPS growth in the third quarter and for the full year." Wall Street securities analysts currently estimate that Fortune Brands will earn between 76 and 81 cents per diluted share in the third quarter (up from 60 cents last year) and between $3.14 and $3.17 for the full year (up from $2.41). "Our targets for both third quarter and full-year performance are within the range of analysts' current estimates," Wesley added. "Achieving these targets would result in solid double-digit growth in earnings per share, even before the benefit of lower goodwill amortization. As we've previously disclosed, the new FAS 142 goodwill accounting standards will benefit quarterly results by 8 cents and the full year by 31 cents. Excluding these benefits and one-time items, meeting our earnings targets would result in diluted EPS growth of 13-22% for the third quarter and 17-19% for the full year." NET GAIN FROM ONE-TIME ITEMS In the second quarter, the company recorded an after-tax net gain of $58.4 million from one-time items. The one-time items were: a credit of $71.3 million for a tax refund resulting from new regulations issued by the IRS permitting utilization of a previously disallowed capital loss; and $12.9 million in after-tax restructuring and other non-recurring charges for the ongoing consolidation and closure of manufacturing and distribution facilities in the office product business. * * * Fortune Brands, Inc. is a consumer products company with annual sales exceeding $5.5 billion.
