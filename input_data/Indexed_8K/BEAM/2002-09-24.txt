We're generating strong cash flow and we're using our financial strength to invest in the growth of our brands, to make high-return strategic moves like our acquisition of Omega cabinets, to buy back shares and to fund an attractive dividend. Increasing the dividend also reflects our confidence in Fortune Brands' prospects for future performance." * * * Fortune Brands, Inc. is a consumer products company with annual sales exceeding $5.5 billion.
