EXHIBIT 99 NEWS RELEASE [FORTUNE BRANDS LOGO] Fortune Brands, Inc., 300 Tower Parkway, Lincolnshire, IL 60069 CONTACT: MEDIA RELATIONS: INVESTOR RELATIONS: CLARKSON HINE ANTHONY J. DIAZ (847) 484-4415 (847) 484-4410 FORTUNE BRANDS REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS COMPANY DELIVERS RECORD RESULTS WITH DOUBLE-DIGIT EPS GROWTH & IMPROVED RETURNS Lincolnshire, IL, October 17, 2002 - Fortune Brands, Inc. (NYSE: FO), a leading consumer brands company, today reported record results for the third quarter of 2002: o Net income was $113.2 million, or 73 cents per diluted share, up 22% from 60 cents a year ago. o Reported results include restructuring and nonrecurring charges of $14.3 million (after tax), or 9 cents per diluted share, related to the sale of certain low-return product lines and the previously announced repositioning program in the office products business. o Excluding these items, diluted earnings per share would have been 82 cents, or 3 cents above the consensus estimate of Wall Street securities analysts, which also excludes restructuring and nonrecurring items. o Reported sales of $1.46 billion were up 1.4%. Excluding the impact of a divestiture (private-label Scotch business), an acquisition (Omega Group cabinets) and 2001 sales of ABSOLUT vodka recorded on an interim basis, sales would have been up 4% on a constant currency basis. o Operating income was $197.7 million, up 14%. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring and other nonrecurring charges, and the benefit of the new goodwill accounting standards, operating income would have increased 13% on a constant currency basis. o Return on equity increased 270 basis points to more than 22%. "In a persistently uncertain economy, Fortune Brands delivered another strong quarter of double-digit growth in earnings per share that exceeded our expectations," said Fortune Brands chairman & chief executive officer Norm Wesley. "Successful strategic initiatives underpinned our record results and helped drive better-than-expected performance in our home products business. We saw our investments in new product development pay off in share gains for brands like Moen, Titleist and Cobra. Newly acquired Omega Group added to the strong underlying growth of our cabinet brands and is already running substantially ahead of our forecasts. The Jim Beam-ABSOLUT joint venture and our (MORE) WWW.FORTUNEBRANDS.COM
FORTUNE BRANDS REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS, PAGE 2 focus on premium brands benefited our spirits & wine business. And our aggressive cost reduction and marketplace repositioning initiatives contributed to ongoing profit recovery in our office products business. We're especially pleased to achieve these broad-based results while further improving key asset return measures, generating strong cash flow, boosting our dividend 8% and increasing share repurchases." The company announced that it bought back 1.5 million shares in the past three months for a total of 3.3 million shares repurchased this year. Fortune Brands also now expects to generate up to $300 million in free cash flow after dividends for 2002. OUTLOOK FOR FOURTH QUARTER & FULL YEAR "Fortune Brands is well on its way to an excellent year," Wesley continued. "As we look to the fourth quarter, we see Fortune Brands continuing its track record of consistently delivering solid results, including strong double-digit EPS growth for the full year. For the fourth quarter, we currently expect that Fortune Brands will earn between 87 and 92 cents per diluted share before restructuring and nonrecurring items (up from 78 cents before a one-time gain last year). For the full year, we're currently expecting earnings per diluted share of $3.15 to $3.20 before a net gain from restructuring and nonrecurring items (up from $2.41 before a one-time gain last year). Achieving our full-year target would result in diluted EPS growth of 18 to 20%, and that's before the 31-cent full-year benefit from the new goodwill accounting standards." CHARGES FOR RESTRUCTURING AND DIVESTITURE In the quarter, the company recorded after-tax nonrecurring charges of $9.4 million related to the pending sale of its low-return plumbing parts business and related facilities. The company anticipates the sale will close in the fourth quarter. Coupled with previous downsizing initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2001, the company expects the divestiture of the plumbing parts operations to be slightly accretive to earnings. The company also recorded after-tax restructuring charges of $4.5 million related to the ongoing consolidation and closure of manufacturing and distribution facilities in the office products business. As previously indicated, Fortune Brands' full-year results will reflect a net gain from a tax refund recorded in the second quarter that will more than offset anticipated charges in the current year. * * * Fortune Brands, Inc. is a consumer products company with annual sales exceeding $5.5 billion.

FORTUNE BRANDS, INC. (In millions, except per share amounts) (Unaudited) NET SALES AND OPERATING COMPANY CONTRIBUTION (a) Prior periods restated to reflect the January 1, 2002 required adoption of EITF issue No. 00-14 relating to the accounting for certain sales incentives and No. 00-25 relating to the accounting for consideration from a vendor. This reclassification did not result in a change in the Company's operating company contribution, earnings, or earnings per common share. (b) Operating company contribution (OCC) is net sales less all costs and expenses other than restructuring and other nonrecurring charges, amortization of intangibles, corporate administrative expense, interest expense, other (income) expense, net, income taxes and minority interests. OCC is not a measure under generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as a substitute for any measure derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This measure may also be inconsistent with similar measures presented by other companies. In assessing this measure, investors should note that restructuring charges and other nonrecurring items that impact the Company's earnings have been excluded in order to provide an additional measure to investors seeking to evaluate the Company's underlying financial performance from year to year. (c) Other operating expenses include restructuring and nonrecurring charges, intangible amortization, and corporate administrative expenses. (d) Net sales and OCC reflect the impact of the Q4 2001 divestiture of the U.K. - - based Scotch Whisky business and sales of Absolut recorded in 2001 on an interim basis. Excluding these items, the three and
nine months' adjusted percentages for Spirits and Wine would be a 4.3% and 2.4% net sales increase and a 3.6% and 6.4% OCC increase, respectively. FREE CASH FLOW AND RETURN ON EQUITY The term "free cash flow" as used in this press release is cash flow from operations less net capital expenditures and dividends to stockholders. Free cash flow and return on equity are not measures under generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as substitutes for any measure derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. These measures may also be inconsistent with similar measures presented by other companies.
