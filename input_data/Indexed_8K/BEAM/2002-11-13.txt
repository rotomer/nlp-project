(NYSE: FO), a leading consumer brands company, today reaffirmed its earnings guidance for the fourth quarter and full year. Speaking to the Morgan Stanley Global Consumer Conference in New York, Fortune Brands Chairman & CEO Norm Wesley said, "Despite ongoing economic uncertainty, Fortune Brands is on its way to another excellent year. Results in each of our businesses were in line with our expectations in October, and we continue to expect fourth quarter earnings between 87 and 92 cents per diluted share before restructuring and nonrecurring items. For the full year, we continue to expect earnings between $3.15 and $3.20 per diluted share before a net gain from restructuring and nonrecurring items. That's up from diluted EPS of $2.41 before a net gain from one-time items in 2001." * * * Fortune Brands, Inc. is a consumer products company with annual sales exceeding $5.5 billion.

Such adjustment may also be inconsistent with results presented by other companies. For the nine months ended September 30, 2002, reported results reflected a gain of $0.46 per share for a tax refund and related interest, partially offset by restructuring and non-recurring charges of $0.19 per share related to rationalization of operations in the office segment and the sale of non-strategic product lines in the home and spirit segments. While the Company has not yet finalized restructuring and nonrecurring items for the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company believes that reported results for the full year 2002 will reflect a net gain from one-time gains and charges. For the year 2001, the Company reported diluted earnings per share of $2.49, which reflected a net gain of 8 cents per share from restructuring and nonrecurring items. These items included gains totaling $0.92 per share for a tax credit, a tax refund, related interest and a gain on sale, partially offset by charges totaling $0.84 per share related to the write-down of select finite-lived intangibles, and restructuring and nonrecurring charges primarily in the office products business. # # #
