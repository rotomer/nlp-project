(1) The following measures are used by management to gauge the financial performance of the overall Company and its operations as well as evaluate specific growth and cost reduction investments. These are non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) measures provided supplementally for investors seeking additional information. These measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP and may be inconsistent with similar measures presented by other companies: "BEFORE CHARGES/GAINS" excludes restructuring and restructuring-related charges and special items, including gains or losses on divestitures, tax credits or charges, and writedowns of identifiable intangibles or goodwill. For 2002, these items included a tax benefit of $0.47 per share and restructuring and related charges of $0.24 per share. "COMPARABLE" GROWTH is "before charges/gains" and also excludes the impact of divestitures (including the 2001 benefit from adjustments related to the Scotch divestiture) over the prior year, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, spirits & wine excise taxes on net sales, and 2001 sales of ABSOLUT vodka recorded on an interim basis, and includes acquisition internal growth (fully added to base period). Amortization of intangibles 1996-2002 is based on current intangible values and FAS 142 goodwill accounting (adopted January 1, 2002). Prior periods reflect current GAAP. For full explanation of restructuring charges and restructuring related charges as well as gains, please see press releases and public filings, which are available at www.fortunebrands.com. "OPERATING (COMPANY) CONTRIBUTION" (OCC) reflects the underlying pre-tax earnings generated by business segment. It is GAAP operating income excluding restructuring and restructuring-related charges, corporate administrative expenses and the amortization of intangibles. "FREE CASH FLOW" reflects the cash flow to invest in internal growth, make acquisitions, pay down debt and repurchase stock. It is equal to GAAP cash flow from operations (includes working capital) less net capital expenditures and dividends to stockholders. "ROE" (return on equity) is net income over the past 12 months before charges/gains divided by a four-quarter average of total stockholders' equity before charges/gains.
"WORKING CAPITAL PER DOLLAR SALES" measures the cents of working capital supporting each dollar of net sales. It is equal to a four-quarter average of the sum of accounts receivable and inventory minus accounts payable divided by the net sales over the past 12 months. "CONTRIBUTION RETURN ON NET TANGIBLE ASSETS" reflects the operating returns of the business. It represents pre-tax contribution divided by total assets less intangibles, accounts payable and other non-interest bearing liabilities. (2) Excludes 31 cents FAS 142 goodwill benefit for 2002. (3) Based on indicated annual rate at end of period. (4) Pro forma for 5/30/97 Gallaher spin-off as it occurred 1/1/96. (5) All brand sales are based on 2002 sales rounded to nearest $50 million.
