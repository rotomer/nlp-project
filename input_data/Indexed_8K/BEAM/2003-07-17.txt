Exhibit 99.1 Fortune Brands Reports Strong 2nd Quarter Operating Results; Operating Income Up 11%; Cabinets, Golf Brands Fuel Share Gains LINCOLNSHIRE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 17, 2003--Fortune Brands, Inc. (NYSE:FO), a leading consumer brands company, today reported strong performance for the second quarter of 2003. The company's results benefited from share gains in key markets, the sustained profit turnaround in the office products unit and favorable foreign exchange. -- Net income was $176.7 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, as compared to $196.9 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Results in both periods included net gains from tax-related credits that exceeded restructuring-related charges. -- Excluding the net gains in both years, diluted earnings per share were $1.03, up 16% from $0.89 a year ago, and 4 cents above the consensus estimate of Wall Street securities analysts. -- Net sales were $1.58 billion, up 5%. -- Operating income was $240 million, up 11%. -- Return on equity was 22%. -- Return on invested capital was 16%. -- Year-to-date share repurchases total 3.0 million. "Fortune Brands once again delivered very strong operating results in a quarter marked by lingering economic uncertainty and poor weather," said Fortune Brands chairman & CEO Norm Wesley. "Our brand investments continued to pay off in hot new products and share gains in key markets. We're adding to that growth with our high-return strategic moves, expanded customer relationships and sustained improvements in productivity and asset returns. Notably in the quarter, our kitchen and bath cabinet brands fueled strong momentum and our Titleist, FootJoy and Cobra golf brands drove significant share gains. Our Jim Beam-ABSOLUT alliance underpinned steady results in spirits and wine and our aggressive cost reductions continue to drive the ongoing profit turnaround in our office products business." Double-Digit EPS Growth Outlook for Third Quarter & Full Year "Fortune Brands is on track for another excellent full-year performance," Wesley said. "The strength of our first half results combined with our great brands and successful strategy enhance our confidence that we'll achieve our long-term goals of double-digit EPS growth and improved returns for the full year. We're targeting double-digit growth in EPS for the third quarter, as well." The company's earnings goals exclude special charges and gains. Net Gain from Special Items The company's second quarter 2003 results included an after-tax net gain of $22.7 million, or 15 cents per share. The net gain stems from a $35 million reversal of tax reserves resulting from the routine audit of Fortune Brands' 1993-1996 tax returns, partly offset by $12.3 million in after-tax restructuring-related charges in the office products and golf businesses and identifiable intangible write-downs in the office products unit. In the second quarter of 2002, the company recorded an after-tax net gain of $58.4 million due to a $71.3 million tax refund related to utilization of a previously disallowed capital loss, partly offset by $12.9 million in after-tax restructuring-related charges in the office products business. Fortune Brands, Inc. is a consumer products company with annual sales exceeding $5.6 billion. Its operating companies have premier brands and leading market positions in home and hardware products, spirits and wine, golf equipment and office products.

This measure may be inconsistent with similar measures provided by other companies. FULL YEAR 2003 DILUTED EPS TARGET The Company's diluted EPS target for 2003 excludes charges/gains. The current estimated impact from special items for the full year 2003 is anticipated to be a net gain. Charges/gains for the six-month period ended June 30, 2003, are detailed above. At the present time, the Company anticipates incurring restructuring items for the second half of 2003 in the range of $20-25 million after tax and a gain from tax-related interest income in the range of $7 million after tax. In the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded an after-tax net gain from special items of $35.1 million, which included (1) restructuring and restructuring-related items of $55.8 million ($36.2 million after tax) and (2) a tax receivable of $61.7 million and related interest income receivable of $14.9 million ($9.6 million after tax). Net Income Before Charges/Gains for the year ended December 31, 2002, which excludes these items, is lower than net income determined in accordance with GAAP. RESTRUCTURING AND RESTRUCTURING-RELATED ITEMS AND WRITE-DOWNS OF IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES The Company recorded pre-tax restructuring and restructuring-related items of $6.6 million ($4.3 million after tax) and $13.1 million ($8.5 million after tax) in the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2003.
