EXHIBIT 99 Fortune Brands Reports Record Third Quarter Results LINCOLNSHIRE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 16, 2003-- Sales Grow 8% on Double-Digit Increases for Cabinets, Titleist & Jim Beam; Operating Income, Net Income and EPS Up Strong Double Digits Fortune Brands, Inc. (NYSE:FO), a leading consumer brands company, today reported record results for the third quarter of 2003. The company's results benefited from broad-based operational strength, sustained share gains in key markets, the ongoing profit recovery in the office products business and favorable foreign exchange. -- Net income grew 29% to $146 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.98, up 34% from $0.73 a year ago. Lower restructuring-related charges and interest on a tax refund benefited comparisons to the year-ago quarter. -- Excluding special items in both years, diluted earnings per share were $1.00, up 22% from $0.82 a year ago, and 8 cents above the consensus estimate of Wall Street Securities analysts. -- Net sales were $1.58 billion, up 8%. -- Operating income was $239 million, up 21%. Operating income benefited from strong underlying performance and lower restructuring-related charges. -- Return on equity was 23%. -- Return on invested capital was 17%. -- Year-to-date share repurchases total 3.4 million. "As our excellent third quarter results demonstrate, the consumer is alive and well at Fortune Brands," said Fortune Brands chairman & CEO Norm Wesley. "Our success starts with great consumer brands that are winning in the marketplace. We're gaining share with innovative new products, sustained brand investments and expanded customer relationships. We're continuing to improve productivity and asset returns. And our breadth and balance further underpin our lengthening track record of consistently strong results. "Reflecting our broad-based strength, Titleist, Jim Beam and our cabinet brands all grew sales double digits in the third quarter, and each of our businesses performed at or above our expectations. Our golf brands shattered third quarter records and significantly outperformed the industry with sizeable share gains. Robust sales growth for our kitchen and bath cabinet brands expanded market share. Strong volume gains for Jim Beam, DeKuyper and super-premium spirits fueled excellent Spirits & Wine performance. And our profit recovery program in Office products is delivering results a year ahead of schedule." Outlook: Double-Digit EPS Growth, Strong Free Cash Flow "Fortune Brands is well on its way to another excellent year," Wesley added. "Reflecting the timing of new product introductions in golf, the annualization of some of our office products savings and higher costs for benefits and insurance, our earnings target for the fourth quarter is low-double-digit EPS growth. The strength of our year-to-date performance and our expectations for the fourth quarter give us confidence that we'll deliver full-year EPS growth in the mid-teens. That would very comfortably achieve our long-term goal of double-digit EPS growth for 2003. Given our broad-based operational strength, we're now targeting 2003 free cash flow after dividends to be in the range of $400 million with continued improvement in returns." The company's earnings goals exclude special charges and gains. Third Quarter Net Charge from Special Items The company's third quarter 2003 results included after-tax restructuring-related charges of $10.7 million in the office products and golf businesses, partly offset by a $6.9 million credit for interest on a tax refund. These special items resulted in a net charge of $3.8 million, or 2 cents per diluted share. In the third quarter of 2002, the company recorded after-tax restructuring-related charges of $14.3 million, or 9 cents per diluted share, related to the sale of certain low-return product lines and the repositioning program in the office products business.

Its operating companies have premier brands and leading market positions in home and hardware products, spirits and wine, golf equipment and office products.

Management uses this and other measures to determine the returns generated by our operating subsidiaries and to evaluate and identify cost-reduction initiatives. Management believes this measure provides investors helpful supplemental information regarding the underlying results of the Company's businesses from year to year. FREE CASH FLOW Three Months Ended September 30, -------------------------------- 2003 2002 % Change -------------------------------- Free Cash Flow (b) $199.5 $201.7 (1.1) Add : Net Capital Expenditures 45.2 44.4 1.8 Dividends Paid 43.7 37.7 15.9 -------------------------------- Cash Flow From Operations $288.4 $283.8 1.6 -------------------------------- Nine Months Ended September 30, -------------------------------- 2003 2002 % Change -------------------------------- Free Cash Flow (b) $306.0 $323.9 (5.5) Add : Net Capital Expenditures 110.2 117.4 (6.1) Dividends Paid 122.8 112.9 8.8 -------------------------------- Cash Flow From Operations $539.0 $554.2 (2.7) -------------------------------- (b) The term "free cash flow" is cash flow from operations less net capital expenditures and dividends to stockholders.

This measure may also be inconsistent with similar measures presented by other companies. EPS BEFORE CHARGES/GAINS The following sets forth EPS Before Charges/Gains, which is a measure not derived in accordance with GAAP. In 2003, EPS Before Charges/Gains is Net Income excluding the $13.0 million ($10.7 million after tax) and $26.1 million ($19.2 million after tax) restructuring and restructuring-related items recorded in the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2003.

In addition, EPS Before Charges/Gains for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2002 excludes a $61.7 million tax claim and $14.9 million ($9.6 million after tax) in tax-related interest income. Management uses this and other measures to evaluate overall performance of the Company, and believes this measure provides investors helpful supplemental information regarding the underlying results of the Company's businesses from year to year. This measure may be inconsistent with similar measures provided by other companies.

The current estimated impact from special items for the full year 2003 is anticipated to be a net gain. Charges/gains for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2003 are detailed above. At the present time, the Company anticipates incurring restructuring and restructuring-related items for the fourth quarter of 2003 in the range of $7-12 million after tax.
