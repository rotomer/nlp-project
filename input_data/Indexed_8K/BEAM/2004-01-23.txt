Exhibit 99 Fortune Brands Reports Record Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results LINCOLNSHIRE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 23, 2004--Fortune Brands, Inc. (NYSE:FO): -- EPS Rises 20% in 4th Quarter on Double-Digit Sales Growth -- Free Cash Flow Reaches $437 Million for 2003 -- Company Targeting to Comfortably Achieve Double-Digit EPS Growth Before Charges/Gains in 2004 Fortune Brands, Inc. (NYSE:FO) today reported record results for the fourth quarter and full year 2003. The company's quarterly results benefited from broad-based share gains, supply chain efficiencies, high-return acquisitions and favorable foreign exchange. "Fortune Brands finished another excellent year with strong momentum as each of our businesses performed at or above our expectations in the fourth quarter," said Fortune Brands chairman & CEO Norm Wesley. "Robust demand in the quarter for brands like Aristokraft, Omega, Moen, Master Lock, Titleist, Kensington and our super-premium spirits drove Fortune Brands' strongest sales growth of the year. In all, 2003 was a year of broad-based success that extended Fortune Brands' track record of consistently strong performance and that significantly surpassed the goals we set a year ago." For the fourth quarter: -- Net income increased 19% to $156 million, and diluted earnings per share were $1.03, up 20% from $0.86 in the year-ago quarter. -- Diluted EPS before charges/gains was $1.07, up 18% from $0.91, and 4 cents above the mean of Wall Street securities analysts' estimates. -- Net sales were $1.66 billion, up 16%. Acquisitions benefited sales by approximately 4% and favorable foreign exchange benefited sales by about 3%. -- Operating income was $266 million, up 19%. Operating income benefited from strong underlying performance, acquisitions and favorable foreign exchange. For the full year: -- Net income grew 10% to $579 million, and diluted earnings per share were $3.86, up 13% from $3.41 a year ago. -- Diluted EPS before charges/gains was $3.79, up 19% from $3.19. -- Net sales were $6.21 billion, up 9.5%. Acquisitions/divestitures benefited sales by approximately 2.5% and favorable foreign exchange benefited sales by about 2%. -- Operating income was $918 million, up 17%. -- Free cash flow was $437 million after dividends and capital expenditures. -- Return on equity was 24%. -- Return on invested capital was 16.6%. -- Share repurchases totaled 4.1 million shares. "We achieved success by continuing to invest in our leading consumer brands to grow faster than our markets," Wesley added. "We gained share with industry-leading new products and expanded customer relationships. We supplemented our growth initiatives with high-return acquisitions. Our operating performance also generated substantial free cash flow that exceeded our targets and enabled us to drive shareholder value even higher." Outlook: Strong Momentum for 2004 "As we look to 2004, we are excited about our prospects to drive sustained growth," Wesley said. "We're carrying strong momentum into a year in which we'll continue to benefit from building our brands, innovative new products, the acquisition of Therma-Tru, and share-gain initiatives like the roll-out of cabinet lines at major home center chains. "For the first quarter and for the full year 2004, we're targeting to comfortably achieve our long-term goal of double-digit growth in diluted EPS before charges/gains. We're also expecting continued improvement in returns." Fortune Brands, Inc. is a $6 billion leading consumer brands company.

Free cash flow is not a measure under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered as a substitute for any measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that free cash flow provides investors with helpful supplemental information about the Company's ability to fund internal growth, make acquisitions, repay debt and repurchase common stock. This measure may also be inconsistent with similar measures presented by other companies. FORTUNE BRANDS, INC.

In addition, EPS Before Charges/Gains for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2002 excludes a $61.7 million tax claim and $14.9 million ($9.6 million after tax) in tax-related interest income. Management uses this and other measures to evaluate overall performance of the Company, and believes this measure provides investors with helpful supplemental information regarding the underlying results of the Company's businesses from year to year.

(b) We have recently been advised that the IRS will conduct its routine review of 1997-2001 tax returns in 2004. Favorable resolution of the audit could result in a gain further benefiting earnings growth in 2004. The preceding sets forth EPS Before Charges/Gains, which is a measure not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Management uses this and other measures to evaluate the overall performance of the Company, and believes this measure provides investors with helpful supplemental information regarding the underlying results of the Company's businesses from year to year. This measure may be inconsistent with similar measures provided by other companies. FORTUNE BRANDS, INC.
