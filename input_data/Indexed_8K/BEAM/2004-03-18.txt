Exhibit 99 Fortune Brands Raises First Quarter Earnings Guidance LINCOLNSHIRE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 18, 2004--Fortune Brands, Inc. (NYSE: FO), a leading consumer brands company, today raised its earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2004. In remarks prepared for delivery to the Reuters Consumer Products & Retail Summit, Fortune Brands chairman and CEO Norm Wesley said, "The year is off to a great start for Fortune Brands. The strong momentum that fueled our excellent fourth quarter has continued into the early months of 2004. We are seeing broad-based demand for our brands, the continued benefit of supply chain efficiencies and the favorable effects of foreign exchange. Each of our businesses is performing at or above our expectations. "We indicated in January that we expected to comfortably achieve our long-term goal of double-digit growth in EPS before charges/gains for both the first quarter and full-year. Analysts currently estimate that our first quarter EPS before charges/gains will be in a range of 76-81 cents. We expect that our first quarter EPS before charges/gains will exceed the top of that range, growing 19% or more. For the full year, while it's still early, our performance so far reinforces our confidence that we will comfortably achieve our long-term growth goals and improve our returns, as well." The company expects that EPS will also grow 19% or more on a GAAP basis for the first quarter. Fortune Brands, Inc. is a $6 billion leading consumer brands company.
