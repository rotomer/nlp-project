Exhibit 99 Fortune Brands Reports Strong Second Quarter Results LINCOLNSHIRE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 23, 2004--Fortune Brands, Inc. (NYSE:FO): -- Sales Increase 19% and Operating Income Rises 23% -- Sustained Share Gains & Office Products Recovery Fuel Broad-based Performance -- Company Continues to See Strong Double-Digit Growth in EPS Before Charges/Gains for 2004 Fortune Brands, Inc. (NYSE:FO), a leading consumer brands company, today reported record operating results for the second quarter of 2004. Strong demand for brands including Aristokraft cabinets, Moen faucets, Therma-Tru doors, Titleist golf balls and Jim Beam bourbon helped drive underlying double-digit sales growth. Results also benefited from share-gain initiatives, sustained productivity improvements and the successful profit recovery program in the office products business. -- Net income was $167.8 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, as compared to $176.7 million, or $1.18 per diluted share in the year ago quarter. Comparisons were adversely impacted by a substantial tax credit in 2003 and, to a lesser degree, a higher level of restructuring-related charges in 2004. -- Excluding special items in both years, diluted EPS before charges/gains was $1.28, up 24% from $1.03, and 3 cents above the mean estimate of Wall Street securities analysts. -- Net sales were $1.89 billion, up 19%. Sales benefited 9% from the net impact of acquisitions, favorable foreign exchange and lower excise taxes. -- Operating income was $295.9 million, up 23%. -- Return on equity was 23%. -- Return on invested capital was 14.8%. -- Year-to-date share repurchases total 3.2 million shares. "Underlying double-digit sales growth for our leading consumer brands drove another very strong quarter of broad-based success for Fortune Brands," said chairman & chief executive officer Norm Wesley. "Our brand-building investments, successful new products and expanding customer relationships helped drive share gains in key markets. High-return acquisitions, sustained productivity gains and supply chain efficiencies added to our results. We further enhanced value for shareholders by repurchasing more than two million shares of Fortune Brands stock since the first quarter. And notably, we recorded the final charges for the restructuring program that has dramatically turned our office products business around." Full-Year Outlook: Strong Double-Digit EPS Growth Before Charges/Gains "Fortune Brands has had a terrific first half of 2004, and as we look to the balance of the year, we're confident in Fortune Brands' ability to continue delivering strong results," Wesley added. "We'll continue to benefit from our powerful consumer brands, successful new products, expanding customer relationships, supply chain efficiencies and an improving U.S. economy. "For the third quarter, we expect to comfortably achieve double-digit growth in EPS before charges/gains. For the full year, we continue to expect that EPS before charges/gains will grow strong double digits. We also anticipate sustained improvement in our returns, and we've increased our target for free cash flow to the range of $400-450 million, as well." The company also noted that it expects the routine IRS review of its 1997-2001 tax returns to conclude in the second half of the year. The company believes completion of the audit could potentially result in significant non-cash tax credits that would benefit this year's earnings.

Management uses this and other measures to determine the returns generated by our operating subsidiaries and to evaluate and identify cost-reduction initiatives. Management believes this measure provides investors with helpful supplemental information regarding the underlying results of the Company's businesses from year to year. This measure may also be inconsistent with similar measures presented by other companies. FREE CASH FLOW 2004 Full Year Targeted Range Free Cash Flow (b) $400 - 450 Add : Net Capital Expenditures 225 - 240 Dividends Paid 175 Cash Flow From Operations $800 - 865 (b) The term "free cash flow" is cash flow from operations less net capital expenditures and dividends paid to stockholders, assuming the June 30th dividend rate and basic shares outstanding. Free cash flow is not a measure under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered as a substitute for any measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that free cash flow provides investors with helpful supplemental information about the Company's ability to fund internal growth, make acquisitions, repay debt and repurchase common stock. This measure may also be inconsistent with similar measures presented by other companies. EPS BEFORE CHARGES/GAINS The following sets forth EPS Before Charges/Gains, which is a measure not derived in accordance with GAAP: In 2004, EPS Before Charges/Gains is Net Income calculated on a per share basis excluding the $27 million ($24.5 million after tax) and $35.2 million ($29.8 million after tax) restructuring and restructuring-related items recorded in the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2004. EPS Before Charges/Gains for the six-month period ended June 30, 2004 also excludes $12 million ($7.6 million after tax) in insurance proceeds from a Kentucky bourbon warehouse fire. In 2003, EPS Before Charges/Gains is Net Income calculated on a per share basis excluding the $6.6 million ($4.3 million after tax) and $13.1 million ($8.5 million after tax) restructuring and restructuring-related items recorded in the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2003. EPS Before Charges/Gains also excludes a $35 million tax reserve reversal and $12 million ($8 million after tax) in identifiable intangible write-downs. Management uses this and other measures to evaluate overall performance of the Company, and believes this measure provides investors with helpful supplemental information regarding the underlying results of the Company's businesses from year to year. This measure may also be inconsistent with similar measures provided by other companies.

For the full year 2004, the Company is targeting EPS before charges/gains to grow at a strong double digit rate. The Company currently expects 2004 EPS on a reported basis to be up strongly. While the Company currently expects net charges in the range of $0.19-0.21 per share in 2004 versus a net gain of $0.07 per share from charges/gains in 2003, favorable resolution of the routine audit of the Company's 1997-2001 tax returns could potentially result in significant non-cash tax credits that would benefit this year's earnings. The estimated $0.19-0.21 per share range consists of $0.24-0.26 in restructuring and restructuring related items partly offset by $.05 in insurance proceeds related to a fire at a Jim Beam warehouse last year recorded in the first quarter of 2004. EPS Before Charges/Gains, which is a measure not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), is Net Income calculated on a per share basis excluding restructuring and restructuring-related items, as well as write-downs in intangibles, tax reserve reversals and tax-related interest income. Management uses this and other measures to evaluate overall performance of the Company, and believes this measure provides investors with helpful supplemental information regarding the underlying results of the Company's businesses from year to year. This measure may also be inconsistent with similar measures provided by other companies. RESTRUCTURING AND RESTRUCTURING-RELATED ITEMS The Company recorded pre-tax restructuring and restructuring-related items of $27 million ($24.5 million after tax) and $35.2 million ($29.8 million after tax) in the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2004. The charges relate to rationalization of operations in the Office, Golf and Home and Hardware segments.
