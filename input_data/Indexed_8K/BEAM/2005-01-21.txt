EXHIBIT 99.1 Fortune Brands Reports Record Results for Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2004 LINCOLNSHIRE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 21, 2005--Fortune Brands, Inc. (NYSE:FO): -- Double-Digit Sales Gains Fuel Strong Double-Digit EPS Growth -- 2005 Outlook: Double-Digit Growth in EPS Before Charges/Gains Fortune Brands, Inc. (NYSE:FO), a leading consumer brands company, today reported record results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2004. Broad-based consumer demand and continued share gains helped drive strong double-digit earnings growth in the fourth quarter. "With sustained momentum in the fourth quarter, Fortune Brands delivered another year of strong double-digit growth that extended our track record of consistently strong results," said Fortune Brands chairman & CEO Norm Wesley. "Successful new products, demand for premium spirits and wine and expanded customer relationships in home products helped fuel double-digit top-line growth in the quarter. Our investments behind powerful consumer brands like Moen, Titleist, Jim Beam, Aristokraft and Kensington continued to generate share gains in key markets. Substantial profit growth for our office products brands added to our success in the quarter. "We saw robust consumer demand throughout the year, and we grew faster than our markets," Wesley added. "Notably, our full-year sales, operating income and earnings per share all grew on an underlying basis at the fastest rates in our 8-year history as Fortune Brands. Broad-based performance has become one of the hallmarks of Fortune Brands' growth, and every one of our businesses significantly outperformed the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. With solid execution, the Therma-Tru acquisition delivered benefits that surpassed our expectations. We're especially pleased with how our office products repositioning program has fully taken hold, resulting in our ACCO World unit's third consecutive year of strong double-digit growth in operating income before charges." For the fourth quarter: -- Net income was $250 million, or $1.68 per diluted share, up 62% from $1.04 in the year-ago quarter. In addition to strong operating performance, EPS comparisons also benefited from a tax-related credit and lower restructuring-related charges. -- Diluted EPS before charges/gains was $1.29, up 21% from $1.07 in the fourth quarter of 2003. These results were eight cents above the consensus estimate of Wall Street securities analysts. -- Net sales increased 15% to $1.91 billion. Sales benefited 4% from the net impact of acquisitions, excise taxes and favorable foreign exchange. -- Operating income was $312 million, up 18%. For the full year: -- Net income was $784 million, or $5.23 per diluted share, up 35% from $3.86 in 2003. -- Diluted EPS before charges/gains was $4.68, up 23% from $3.79. -- Net sales increased 18% to $7.32 billion. Full-year sales benefited 8.5% from the net impact of acquisitions, excise taxes and favorable foreign exchange. -- Operating income was $1.12 billion, up 22%. -- Free cash flow was nearly $400 million after dividends and capital expenditures. -- Return on equity was 27.6%, benefiting 2.8% from net charges/gains. -- Return on invested capital was 17.8%, benefiting 1.7% from net charges/gains. -- Share repurchases totaled 4.4 million shares. Outlook for Double-Digit EPS Growth "Fortune Brands looks to 2005 with confidence," Wesley added. "Several initiatives position us well to continue delivering strong earnings growth. We expect to benefit from the breadth and strength of our market positions, innovative new products, the expansion of our winning partnerships with great brands and customers, the efficiency of our supply chains, and the power of our financial resources. "2004 was a year of extraordinary performance, and we're anticipating record results in 2005 driven by growth that's more in line with our long-term goals. For both the first quarter and the full year, we're targeting to achieve our long-term goal of double-digit growth in diluted EPS before charges/gains. We anticipate delivering against our long-term goal even with challenging comparisons created by the strength of our 2004 results." The company does not anticipate recording restructuring charges in 2005. The previously announced routine IRS review of the company's 1997-2001 tax returns concluded in the fourth quarter. Reported fourth quarter results benefited from $58.5 million in tax-related credits ($0.40 per diluted share). The company also expects in the first quarter of 2005 to receive a tax refund of approximately $56 million related to these tax years. Including the benefit of the tax refund, the company is currently targeting free cash flow for 2005 in the range of $450-500 million after dividends and capital expenditures.

EPS BEFORE CHARGES/GAINS - ------------------------ The following sets forth EPS Before Charges/Gains, which is a measure not derived in accordance with GAAP: For the fourth quarter of 2004, EPS Before Charges/Gains is Net Income calculated on a per share basis excluding the $3.3 million ($1.9 million after tax) in restructuring and restructuring-related items and $58.5 million in tax-related credits. For the full year 2004, EPS Before Charges/Gains excludes $48.3 million ($32.9 million after tax) in restructuring and restructuring-related items, $107.7 million in tax-related credits and $12 million ($7.6 million after tax) in insurance proceeds from a Kentucky bourbon warehouse fire.

Reflecting the absence of the net gain recorded in 2004, the Company is targeting full year GAAP EPS to be off modestly to up and for the first quarter of 2005 to increase double digits. In 2004, the Company recorded net gains of $.01 in the first quarter and $.55 for the full year. Currently, the Company does not expect to record any restructuring charges/gains during 2005. EPS Before Charges/Gains, which is a measure not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), is Net Income calculated on a per share basis excluding restructuring and restructuring-related items, as well as write-downs in intangibles, tax reserve reversals and tax-related interest income. Management uses this and other measures to evaluate overall performance of the Company, and believes this measure provides investors with helpful supplemental information regarding the underlying results of the Company's businesses from year to year. This measure may also be inconsistent with similar measures provided by other companies. RESTRUCTURING AND RESTRUCTURING-RELATED ITEMS - --------------------------------------------- The Company recorded pre-tax restructuring and restructuring-related items of $3.3 million ($1.9 million after tax) and $48.3 million ($32.9 million after tax) in the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2004.
