DRIVING SHAREHOLDER VALUE

Second, drive value by sharply allocating capital with discipline and patience based on returns prioritized generally as follows:
(1) Internal growth and ?returns: Capital expenditures payback in 3 years; emphasis on growth to drive value for Home and Spirits & Wine given exceptional returns, and a balance on growth and ?returns for Golf and Office.
(2) Add-on acquisitions, joint ventures: Targeted, synergy-driven and must buy well; focus where long-term returns highest  Home brands and premium spirits & wine.
(3) Share buybacks: Forward 2005 P/E discount to S&P 500 has narrowed but remains 5% to S&P 500 (2/1)  FO's sustained stronger growth, returns and cash flow, plus stronger balance sheet merit return to a premium.
 FO also is trading at approximately a 25% discount to other leading consumer products companies.
(4) Dividend: ?Every year as Fortune Brands, including two consecutive double-digit increases to current $1.32 rate.
(5) Debt reduction: Solid "A" debt ratings ($1,745mm total net debt, 11.7x interest coverage with leases,12/31/04) and goal to sustain "A" category rating long-term.
Third, extend consistent track record of creating shareholder value: focus on internal brand building and delivering results while carefully progressing the evolution of the portfolio and leveraging our strong overall financial resources to drive further value.
