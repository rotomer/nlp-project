Item 5.04 Temporary Suspension of Trading under Registrant's Employee Benefit Plans.
 
Fortune Brands, Inc. ("Fortune Brands") will distribute in the form of a dividend to its stockholders all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of its subsidiary, ACCO World Corporation (the "Spin-off"). On July 29, 2005, Fortune Brands sent a notice to its directors and executive officers informing them that in connection with the Spin-off, there would be a blackout period under each of the Fortune Brands Retirement Savings Plan, the Fortune Brands Hourly Employee Retirement Savings Plan and the Future Brands Retirement Savings Plan (collectively, the "Plans"). This blackout period is expected to begin on or about August 16, 2005 and is expected to end the week of August 21, 2005.
 
The blackout periods are necessary in order to ensure accurate accounting and administration of the Plans as a result of the Spin-off. During the blackout periods, the directors and executive officers of Fortune Brands will be prohibited from directly or indirectly purchasing, selling or otherwise transferring certain equity securities of Fortune Brands.
 
A copy of the notice sent to Fortune Brands' directors and executive officers is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
Date: July 29, 2005
 
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Date: July 29, 2005
 
 
As you are aware, on or about August 16, 2005 Fortune Brands, Inc. will distribute in the form of a dividend to its stockholders all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of its subsidiary, ACCO World Corporation. As previously communicated in my memo to you dated June 24, 2005, in connection with the Spin-off, there will be "blackout" periods for each of the (1) Fortune Brands Retirement Savings Plan, (2) the Fortune Brands Hourly Employee Retirement Savings Plan and (3) the Future Brands Retirement Savings Plan during which participants in those Plans will be unable to engage in transactions under the Plans involving Fortune Common Stock. These blackout periods are necessary in order to ensure accurate accounting and administration of the Plans as a result of the Spin-off. This notice is to inform you that the blackout periods have been postponed as described below.
 
As previously explained, pursuant to Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, you will be unable to trade in Fortune Common Stock (including options and derivatives) during the blackout periods for each of the Plans when participants under those Plans will be prohibited from (1) directing or diversifying investments in their respective individual Plan accounts, (2) obtaining loans from any of the Plans or (3) obtaining distributions from any of the Plans.
 
SEC rules require that during such blackout periods, executive officers and directors are prohibited from directly or indirectly, purchasing, selling or otherwise transferring any equity security of the company (in this case, Fortune) acquired by the individual in connection with his or her service as an executive officer or director. "Equity securities" are defined broadly to include options and other derivatives. Covered transactions are not limited to those involving direct ownership, but include any transaction in which the executive officer or director has a pecuniary interest.
 
If you engage in a transaction that violates these rules, you can be required to disgorge your profits from the transaction, and you are subject to civil and criminal penalties.
 
We are obligated under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to provide you with this notice, which contains specific information regarding the blackout periods. In addition, we are required to file this notice with the Securities Exchange Commission as part of a Form 8K.
We expect the following blackout periods to occur with respect to the employee plans:
 
Fortune Brands Retirement Savings Plan; Fortune Brands Hourly Employee
Retirement Savings Plan; Future Brands Retirement Savings Plan
 
The Blackout Period is expected to begin on or about August 16, 2005, at 4:00 p.m., Eastern time, and is expected to end the week of August 21, 2005. During this period, you can determine whether the blackout period has started or ended by contacting the Fidelity Retirement Benefits Line at 1-800-835-5095 or online through Fidelity NetBenefits
