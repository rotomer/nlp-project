Exhibit 99 Fortune Brands Announces Strong Third Quarter Results LINCOLNSHIRE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 4, 2005--Fortune Brands, Inc. (NYSE:FO): -- Strong Top-Line Growth Drives Double-Digit Growth in EPS Before Charges/Gains -- Cabinets, Moen, Titleist & Jim Beam Fuel Robust Sales Gain -- Integration of New Spirits & Wine Brands Progressing Well Fortune Brands, Inc. (NYSE:FO), the consumer brands company, today announced strong operating results for the third quarter of 2005. Consumer demand for brands including Moen, Titleist, Jim Beam and the company's cabinet brands drove broad-based sales for Fortune Brands that grew at an 8% underlying rate. The company's recently acquired spirits and wine brands, including Sauza, Courvoisier, Canadian Club and Clos du Bois, added to sales. Fortune Brands' continuing operations, which exclude the office products business that was spun-off to shareholders during the quarter, delivered double-digit growth in earnings per share before charges/gains. Reported results were impacted by the required expensing of a portion of the spirits and wine acquisition purchase price. "The third quarter was a period of tremendous progress for Fortune Brands: our consumer brands drove strong top-line growth, we delivered on our earnings growth goals, and we completed the two most significant value-creating strategic moves in our eight-year history as Fortune Brands," said Fortune Brands chairman & CEO Norm Wesley. "Sales grew in each of our three consumer businesses, our largest brands continued to gain market share, and we grew sales double-digits in cabinets, faucets and entry doors. Our broad-based success was once again driven by successful new products, effective marketing, and customers who increasingly look to us as a partner of choice." For the third quarter: -- Net income was $92.2 million ($0.61 per diluted share), as compared to $226.8 million ($1.52 per diluted share) in the year-ago quarter. EPS comparisons were adversely impacted by three significant items: the expensing of $83 million of the purchase price of the spirits and wine acquisition, as required by mark-to-market accounting standards for transactions based in foreign currencies ($0.55 per diluted share); the absence of a $45 million tax-related credit recorded in the year-ago period ($0.31 per diluted share); and the absence of income due to the ACCO spin-off (net $0.16 per diluted share). On a continuing operations basis for the third quarter: -- Diluted EPS before charges/gains was $1.12, up 12% from $1.00 in the third quarter of 2004. These results were in line with the mean estimate of Wall Street securities analysts. -- Net sales were $1.8 billion, up 19%. Sales benefited 11 percentage points from the net impact of acquisitions, excise taxes and favorable foreign exchange. -- Operating income increased 18% to $294.5 million. -- Return on equity before charges/gains was 21.5%. -- Return on invested capital before charges/gains was 12.7%. "It's notable that we achieved our double-digit EPS growth goal even with the headwinds of higher costs for energy and raw materials and even before the slight benefit from our new spirits and wine brands," Wesley added. "Results were also impacted by costs for initiatives that will benefit us in the long run, including plant start-up expenses and one-time expenses for a lower cost sourcing initiative in Home & Hardware, and integration-related costs in Spirits & Wine. Our new spirits and wine brands added slightly to earnings in the quarter and are on track to contribute modestly to EPS over the balance of 2005, as we've previously projected. We're pleased with the pace and progress of the integration, and we now believe that the benefit to 2006 earnings from this acquisition will be at or above the high end of the 25-35 cents-per-share range we've previously communicated. We believe Fortune Brands is well positioned to deliver significant value in the years ahead as a more sharply focused, high-performance consumer brands company." Reaffirming Full-Year Outlook for Double-Digit Growth in EPS Before Charges/Gains "As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect to continue delivering solid performance and we believe our breadth across attractive consumer categories will continue to serve us well," Wesley continued. "We'll face challenging comparisons to last year's fourth quarter when underlying sales increased double-digits and diluted EPS before charges/gains was up more than 20%. Even with these tough comparisons and our continued expectations for more normalized growth in the housing and home-improvement market, we're targeting fourth quarter EPS before charges/gains to grow at a mid-single to low-double-digit rate above the very strong results of the year-ago quarter. For the full year, we're reaffirming our expectation that we'll deliver double-digit growth in EPS before charges/gains, achieving our long-term goal." The company also reaffirmed its target for full-year free cash flow after dividends in the range of $400-450 million, excluding any impact from the spirits and wine acquisition.

For the full year, the Company continues to target double-digit growth in EPS before charges/gains for continuing operations. The Company expects fourth quarter and full year GAAP EPS from continuing operations to be significantly below the prior year due to the tax-related credits recorded in the prior year periods. In addition, full year GAAP EPS will also be negatively impacted by acquisition-related expenses that were recorded in the current quarter.
