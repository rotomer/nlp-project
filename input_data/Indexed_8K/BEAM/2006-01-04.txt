Exhibit 99.1
 
 
The following unaudited pro forma financial statements present the unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet of Fortune Brands, Inc. ("Fortune Brands" or the "Company") as of September 30, 2005 and the unaudited pro forma combined income statements of the Company for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005 and year ended December 31, 2004 to give effect to the acquisition of certain "acquired businesses" and issuance of new long-term debt in each case as if the acquisition and legal transfer of the acquired businesses and issuance of new long-term debt occurred as of January 1, 2004. The acquired businesses are more than 20 spirits and wine brands and distribution assets described in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005. The actual legal transfer of the acquired businesses will occur in a series of transactions during the six-month period commencing July 26, 2005. In addition, the following unaudited pro forma consolidated income statements of Fortune Brands for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and the years ended December 2004, 2003 and 2002 adjust the historical financial statements of Fortune Brands as if the spin-off of ACCO World Corporation had occurred as of January 1, 2002.
 
The historical financial information of Fortune Brands set forth below has been derived from the historical unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005 and the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. This information is based on historical results of operations and is adjusted as described above and in the notes.
 
Historical results for the acquired businesses include pre-acquisition one-time and unusual charges, such as adjustments to compensation expense for changes in the fair value of the stock of Allied Domecq PLC (the prior owner of the acquired businesses), as well as allocations of selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses that are not representative of expenses on an ongoing basis. The pro forma adjustments are based on available information and certain assumptions that management believes are reasonable. In the opinion of management, all adjustments required to fairly present the unaudited interim pro forma financial information have been made. The adjustments are directly attributable to the transactions and (in the case of the income statement) are expected to have a continuing impact on the financial position and results of operations of Fortune Brands.
 
The unaudited pro forma financial information presented does not purport to represent what the results of operations or financial position of Fortune Brands would actually have been had the acquisition occurred January 1, 2004, or the spin-off had occurred as of January 1, 2002, or to project the results of operations or financial position of Fortune Brands for any future periods.
 
The Company expects to incur restructuring charges as a result of the acquisition. Additional restructuring costs will be recorded when factually supportable information is available in order to estimate these costs. The pro forma adjustments do not reflect any operating efficiencies or cost savings that may be achievable with respect to the combined business of Fortune Brands and the acquired businesses.
 
The spin-off of ACCO World Corporation is accounted for as a discontinued operation under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," when Fortune Brands issues financial statements subsequent to the consummation of the spin-off transaction, which occurred on August 16, 2005. The unaudited pro forma financial information reflects ACCO World Corporation as a discontinued operation, and, accordingly, its net assets and results of operations are excluded from the continuing operations of Fortune Brands.
 
The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the historical financial statements and related notes thereto of Fortune Brands included in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005 and the 2004, 2003 and 2002 Annual Reports on Form 10-K.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PRO FORMA BALANCE SHEET ADJUSTMENTS
 
 
 
 
PRO FORMA STATEMENT OF INCOME ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2005 AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004
 
 
The most recent fiscal year end for the acquired businesses is August 31, 2004. Since the acquired businesses and Fortune Brands' most recent fiscal year ends differ by more than 93 days, the Securities and Exchange Commission rules require that the reporting periods be more closely aligned for the purpose of preparing pro forma financial information. As a result, the pro forma statement of income was prepared by combining the Fortune Brands statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2004 with the acquired businesses' statements of revenues and direct expenses for the twelve months ended February 28, 2005.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The interest rate on the fixed rate debt is expected to be approximately 4.8%. The pro forma interest rate on commercial paper was determined based on the Fortune Brands interest rate for the six months and 25 days ended July 25, 2005, adjusted for the credit rating subsequent to the acquisition, which was 2.989%.
 
A change in the interest rate of one-fourth of one percent would affect interest expense, net of taxes, for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 as follows:
