From time to time, FORTUNE BRANDS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), may enter into one or more underwriting agreements that provide for the sale of designated securities to the several underwriters named therein. The standard provisions set forth herein may be incorporated by reference in any such underwriting agreement (an "Underwriting Agreement"). The Underwriting Agreement, including the provisions incorporated therein by reference, is herein referred to as this Agreement. Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Underwriting Agreement are used herein as therein defined.
 
 
The Company proposes to issue and sell from time to time certain of (a) its debt securities (the "Debt Securities") to be issued pursuant to the provisions of an Indenture dated as of April 15, 1999, as supplemented (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., as Trustee (the "Trustee") and (b) its Warrants (the "Debt Warrants") to purchase Debt Securities (such Debt Securities to be purchasable through the exercise of Debt Warrants being referred to herein as the "Debt Warrant Securities") to be evidenced by warrant certificates (the "Warrant Certificates") and to be issued pursuant to the provisions of the Debt Warrant Agreement identified in the Underwriting Agreement. The Debt Securities may be convertible into Common Stock, par value $3.125 per share, of the Company ("Common Stock") as provided in or pursuant to the Indenture, and Preferred Share Purchase Rights (the "Rights") may be delivered with Common Stock upon conversion of any convertible Debt Securities. The Debt Securities and Debt Warrants to be sold pursuant to this Agreement, but not the Debt Warrant Securities or the Common Stock or Rights, if any, issuable or deliverable upon conversion of any convertible Debt Securities, are collectively referred to herein as the "Offered Securities". The Debt Securities and Debt Warrants will have or be of varying designations, maturities, rates and times of payment of interest, selling prices, exercise prices, conversion prices, expiration dates, redemption terms, currencies and other terms.
 
The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") registration statements relating to the Debt Securities and Debt Warrants and the shares of Common Stock and Rights, if any, issuable or deliverable upon conversion of any convertible Debt Securities, has filed such amendments thereto as may have been required to the date of the Underwriting Agreement and has filed with, or mailed for filing to, or shall promptly hereafter file with or mail for filing to, the Commission a prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Offered Securities and the Debt Warrant Securities, if any, pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act of 1933. The term "Registration Statement" means such registration statements as amended to the date of the Underwriting Agreement. The term "Basic Prospectus" means the prospectus included in the Registration Statement relating to the Debt Securities and the
 
Debt Warrants, as updated from time to time. The term "Prospectus" means the Basic Prospectus together with the prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Offered Securities and the Debt Warrant Securities, if any, as filed with, or mailed for filing to, or as shall promptly hereafter be filed with or mailed for filing to, the Commission pursuant to such Rule 424. The term "preliminary prospectus" means a preliminary prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Offered Securities and the Debt Warrant Securities, if any, together with the Basic Prospectus. As used herein, the terms "Registration Statement", "Basic Prospectus", "Prospectus" and "preliminary prospectus" shall include in each case the material, if any, incorporated by reference therein.
 
The term "Underwriters' Securities" means the Offered Securities to be purchased by the Underwriters herein. The term "Contract Securities" means the Offered Securities, if any, to be purchased pursuant to the delayed delivery contracts referred to below.
 
 
If the Prospectus provides for sales of Offered Securities pursuant to delayed delivery contracts, the Company hereby authorizes the Underwriters to solicit offers to purchase Contract Securities on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Prospectus pursuant to delayed delivery contracts substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto ("Delayed Delivery Contracts") but with such changes therein as the Company may authorize or approve. Delayed Delivery Contracts are to be with institutional investors approved by the Company and of the types set forth in the Prospectus. On the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), the Company will pay the Manager as compensation, for the accounts of the Underwriters, the fee set forth in the Underwriting Agreement in respect of the principal amount and number of Contract Securities. The Underwriters will not have any responsibility in respect of the validity or the performance of Delayed Delivery Contracts.
 
If the Company executes and delivers Delayed Delivery Contracts with institutional investors, the principal amount and number of Contract Securities shall be deducted from the principal amount and number of Offered Securities to be purchased by the several Underwriters and the aggregate principal amount or number of Offered Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter shall be reduced pro rata in proportion to the principal amount or number, as the case may be, of Offered Securities set forth opposite each Underwriter's name in the Underwriting Agreement, except to the extent that the Manager determines that such reduction shall be otherwise and so advises the Company.
 
 
The Company is advised by the Manager that the Underwriters propose to make a public offering of their respective portions of the Underwriters' Securities as soon after this Agreement is entered into as in the Manager's judgment is advisable. The terms of the public offering of the Underwriters' Securities are set forth in the Prospectus.
 
 
Except as otherwise provided in this Article IV, payment for the Underwriters' Securities shall be made by wire transfer to an account designated by the Company in immediately available funds at the time, on the date and at the place set forth in the Underwriting Agreement, upon delivery to the Manager for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters of the Underwriters' Securities (other than Debt Securities in registered global form) registered in such names and in such denominations as the Manager shall request in writing not less than two full business days prior to the date of delivery and, in the case of Underwriters' Securities that are Debt Securities in registered global form, upon delivery to the Depositary identified in the Underwriting Agreement of a single global Debt Security certificate, registered in the name of the Depositary or a nominee thereof, for credit to the respective accounts of the Depositary participants. The time and date of such payment and delivery with respect to the Underwriters' Securities are herein referred to as the Closing Date.
 
Delivery of any Underwriters' Securities that are (i) Debt Securities in bearer form on the Closing Date shall be initially effected by delivery of a single temporary global Debt Security without coupons (the "Global Debt Security") evidencing the Offered Securities that are Debt Securities in bearer form and (ii) Debt Warrants in bearer form shall be effected only by delivery of a single permanent global Debt Warrant (the "Global Debt Warrant") evidencing the Offered Securities that are Debt Warrants in bearer form, in each case to a common depositary for Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, Brussels office, as operator of the Euro-clear System ("Euro-clear"), and for Centrale de Livraison de Valeurs Mobilieres S.A. ("CEDEL") for credit to the respective accounts at Euro-clear or CEDEL of each Underwriter or such other accounts as each Underwriter may direct. Any Global Debt Security or Global Debt Warrant shall be delivered to the Manager not later than the Closing Date, against payment of funds to the Company in the net amount due to the Company for such Global Debt Security or Global Debt Warrant, as the case may be, by the method and in the form set forth herein. The Company shall cause definitive Debt Securities in bearer form to be prepared and delivered in exchange for such Global Debt Security in such manner and at such time as may be provided in or pursuant to the Indenture; , , that the Global Debt Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Debt Securities in bearer form only on or
provided
however
 
after the date specified for such purpose in the Prospectus. The Offered Debt Warrants shall be evidenced only by a Global Debt Warrant until their expiration.
 
 
The several obligations of the Underwriters hereunder are subject to the following conditions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
In further consideration of the agreements of the Underwriters contained in this Agreement, the Company covenants as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Each of the several Underwriters agrees with the Company that:
 
 
 
 
 
 
If Underwriters' Securities that are Debt Securities are to be distributed through a selling group consisting of banks, brokers or dealers, the Manager agrees that it shall cause each member of such selling group to enter into an agreement that it will comply with this paragraph. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by the applicable provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder, including the D Rules.
 
Each of the several Underwriters further agrees with the Company that:
 
 
 
 
 
 
agreements contained in clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d) on its behalf or (ii) agrees that it will obtain from such affiliate for the Manager's benefit and the benefit of the Company the representations and agreements contained in clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d); and
 
 
If Underwriters' Securities that are Debt Warrants are to be distributed through a selling group consisting of banks, brokers or dealers, the Manager agrees that it shall cause each member of such selling group to enter into an agreement that it will comply with this paragraph. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by the applicable provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder, including the D Rules.
 
 
The Company represents and warrants to each Underwriter that (i) each document, if any, filed or to be filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and incorporated by reference in the Prospectus complied or will comply when so filed in all material respects with such Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, (ii) each part of the registration statement (including the documents incorporated by reference therein), filed with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 relating to the Debt Securities and Debt Warrants when such part became effective, did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (iii) each preliminary prospectus, if any, filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act of 1933 complied when so filed in all material respects with such Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder, (iv) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus comply and, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, will comply in all material respects with the Securities Act of 1933 and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder and (v) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus do not contain and, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; except that these representations and warranties do not apply to (a) statements or omissions in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus based upon information furnished to the Company in writing by any Underwriter expressly for use therein and (b) those parts of the Registration Statement which constitute the Statement of Eligibility under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 on Form T-1 of the Trustee.
 
The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 or Section 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (if used within the period set forth in paragraph (c) of Article VI hereof and as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished in writing to the Company by any Underwriter expressly for use therein; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity with respect to preliminary prospectuses shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter (or to the benefit of any person controlling such Underwriter) from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Offered Securities if a copy of the Prospectus or the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented (if the Prospectus has been amended or supplemented prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Offered Securities to such person) had not been sent or given to such person at or prior to such written confirmation and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in such preliminary prospectus was corrected in such Prospectus or Prospectus as amended or supplemented, as the case may be.
 
Each Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and any person controlling the Company to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished in writing by such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus.
 
In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such
 
proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and the representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to local counsel) for all such indemnified parties, and that all such fees shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Manager in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the second preceding paragraph and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the first preceding paragraph. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
 
If the indemnification provided for in this Article VIII is unavailable to an indemnified party under the second or third paragraphs hereof or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities and (ii) the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Offered Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in respect thereof. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Article VIII were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities
 
referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article VIII, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities underwritten and distributed to the public by such Underwriter were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act of 1933) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Article VIII are several, in proportion to the respective principal amount or number, as the case may be, of Offered Securities purchased by each of such Underwriters, and not joint.
 
The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Article VIII and the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by any Underwriter or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its directors or officers or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Offered Securities.
 
 
This Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Manager, by notice to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) trading of any securities issued by the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities; (iv) a material disruption of the settlement or clearance of debt securities in the United States shall occur and continue until at least the business day preceding the Closing Date or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in the reasonable judgment of the Manager, is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Offered Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and the Prospectus.
 
 
If any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Underwriters' Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, and the aggregate amount of Underwriters' Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of the Underwriters' Securities, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions which the amounts of Underwriters' Securities set forth opposite their names in the Underwriting Agreement bear to the aggregate amount of Underwriters' Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Manager may specify, to purchase the Underwriters' Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase; provided that in no event shall the amount of Underwriters' Securities which any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement be increased pursuant to this Article X by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such amount of Underwriters' Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Underwriters' Securities and the aggregate amount of Underwriters' Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of the Underwriters' Securities and arrangements satisfactory to the Manager and the Company for the purchase of such Underwriters' Securities, are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement, or the provisions hereof applicable to the sale and purchase of the Underwriters' Securities, will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or of the Company. In any such case either the Manager or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under the Underwriting Agreement.
 
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement, with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with the Offered Securities.
 
This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
 
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the date hereof is after a December 31 or June 30, as the case may be, and before the following January 15 or July 15, this Security shall bear interest from such January 15 or July 15; provided, however, that if the Company shall default in the payment of interest due on such January 15 or July 15 then this Security shall bear interest from the next preceding January 15 or July 15 to which interest has been paid, or, if no interest has been paid on the Securities, from January 12, 2006. The interest so payable on any January 15 or July 15 will, subject to certain exceptions provided in the Indenture (the "Indenture") dated as of April 15, 1999, between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (formerly The Chase Manhattan Bank), as Trustee (the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture with respect to the Securities of this series), be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the December 31 or June 30, as the case may be, next preceding such January 15 or July 15. The principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security are payable at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided that interest may be paid, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the Person entitled thereto at its address on the Security Register. Any interest not punctually paid or duly provided for shall be payable as provided in said Indenture.
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company designated as its 5 1/8% Notes Due 2011 (Securities of such series being hereinafter called the "Securities"), initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of $750,000,000 (but subject to additional issuances from time to time), issued and to be issued under the Indenture, to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
 
Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, this Security will be issued in global form only registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee. This Security will not be issued in definitive form, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, and ownership of this Security shall be maintained in book-entry form by the Depositary for the accounts of participating organizations of the Depositary.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin and currency, herein prescribed.
 
The Securities will be redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the Company's option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities then outstanding to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Securities to be redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the applicable Treasury Rate plus 15 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date.
 
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date: (i) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the remaining life (as defined below), yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month) or (ii) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
 
The Treasury Rate will be calculated by the Independent Investment Banker on the third business day preceding the date fixed for redemption.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the U.S. Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term ("remaining life") of the Securities to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining life of the Securities.
 
"Comparable Treasury Price" means (1) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
 
"Independent Investment Banker" means either Barclays Capital Inc. or Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, as specified by the Company, or, if these firms are unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means (1) Barclays Capital Inc. and Credit Suisse First Boston LLC and their respective successors, provided, however, that if either of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. government securities dealer in New York City (a "primary treasury dealer"), the Company will substitute therefor another primary treasury dealer and (2) any other primary treasury dealer selected by the Company after consultation with the Independent Investment Banker.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding such redemption date.
 
The Company will mail a notice of redemption to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed by first-class mail at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption. Unless the Company defaults on the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities or portions thereof called for redemption on the redemption date. If fewer than all of the Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select, not more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, the particular Securities or portions thereof for redemption from the Outstanding Securities not previously called by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate.
 
Section 4.03 (including subparagraph (4) thereof and clause (B), but not clause (A), of such subparagraph) and Section 10.10 (including subparagraph (5) thereof) of the Indenture contain provisions applicable to this Security that provide for defeasance at any time of (a) the entire indebtedness on this Security and (b) certain restrictive covenants and certain Events of Default upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Security may be registered for transfer on the Security Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the registered Holder hereof or its attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
The Company may, from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the Holders of the Securities, increase the aggregate principal amount of the Securities which may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture and issue such increased principal amount (or any portion thereof), in which case any additional Securities so issued will have the same form and terms (other than the date of issuance and, under certain circumstances, the date from which interest thereon will begin to accrue), and will carry the same right to receive accrued and unpaid interest, as the Securities previously issued, and such additional Securities will form a single series with the Securities.
 
The Securities are issuable only as Registered Securities in denominations of integral multiples of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture, and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Registered Securities of different authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company or the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to the Securities shall occur, the principal of all the Securities may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities under the Indenture at any time by the Company with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
 
the then Outstanding Securities of this series and of each other series issued under the Indenture and affected by such amendment or modification. The Indenture also permits the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities, to waive certain past defaults under the Indenture with respect to the Securities and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver shall be conclusive and binding upon the Holder of this Security and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not a notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or any successor Person, either directly or through the Company, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.
 
Except as otherwise defined herein, all terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
This Security shall be deemed to be a contract made under the laws of the State of New York and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of said State.
 
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee by the manual signature of one of its authorized officers, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under said Indenture, or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.

The Company may, from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the Holders of the Securities, increase the aggregate principal amount of the Securities which may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture and issue such increased principal amount (or any portion thereof), in which case any additional Securities so issued will have the same form and terms (other than the date of issuance and, under certain circumstances, the date from which interest thereon will begin to accrue), and will carry the same right to receive accrued and unpaid interest, as the Securities previously issued, and such additional Securities will form a single series with the Securities.

As provided in the Indenture, and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Registered Securities of different authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

The Securities will be redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the Company's option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities then outstanding to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Securities to be redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the applicable Treasury Rate plus 20 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date.
 
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date: (i) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the remaining life (as defined below), yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month) or (ii) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
 
The Treasury Rate will be calculated by the Independent Investment Banker on the third business day preceding the date fixed for redemption.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the U.S. Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term ("remaining life") of the Securities to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining life of the Securities.

"Independent Investment Banker" means either Barclays Capital Inc. or Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, as specified by the Company, or, if these firms are unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means (1) Barclays Capital Inc. and Credit Suisse First Boston LLC and their respective successors, provided, however, that if either of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. government securities dealer in New York City (a "primary treasury dealer"), the Company will substitute therefor another primary treasury dealer and (2) any other primary treasury dealer selected by the Company after consultation with the Independent Investment Banker.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding such redemption date.
 
The Company will mail a notice of redemption to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed by first-class mail at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption. Unless the Company defaults on the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities or portions thereof called for redemption on the redemption date. If fewer than all of the Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select, not more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, the particular Securities or portions thereof for redemption from the Outstanding Securities not previously called by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate.
 
Section 4.03 (including subparagraph (4) thereof and clause (B), but not clause (A), of such subparagraph) and Section 10.10 (including subparagraph (5) thereof) of the Indenture contain provisions applicable to this Security that provide for defeasance at any time of (a) the entire indebtedness on this Security and (b) certain restrictive covenants and certain Events of Default upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein.

The Company may, from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the Holders of the Securities, increase the aggregate principal amount of the Securities which may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture and issue such increased principal amount (or any portion thereof), in which case any additional Securities so issued will have the same form and terms (other than the date of issuance and, under certain circumstances, the date from which interest thereon will begin to accrue), and will carry the same right to receive accrued and unpaid interest, as the Securities previously issued, and such additional Securities will form a single series with the Securities.
 
The Securities are issuable only as Registered Securities in denominations of integral multiples of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture, and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Registered Securities of different authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company or the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to the Securities shall occur, the principal of all the Securities may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities under the Indenture at any time by the Company with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of

The Indenture also permits the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities, to waive certain past defaults under the Indenture with respect to the Securities and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver shall be conclusive and binding upon the Holder of this Security and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not a notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or any successor Person, either directly or through the Company, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.
 
Except as otherwise defined herein, all terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
This Security shall be deemed to be a contract made under the laws of the State of New York and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of said State.

The principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security are payable at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided that interest may be paid, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the Person entitled thereto at its address on the Security Register.

This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company designated as its 5 7/8% Notes Due 2036 (Securities of such series being hereinafter called the "Securities"), initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of $300,000,000 (but subject to additional issuances from time to time), issued and to be issued under the Indenture, to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
 
Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, this Security will be issued in global form only registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee. This Security will not be issued in definitive form, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, and ownership of this Security shall be maintained in book-entry form by the Depositary for the accounts of participating organizations of the Depositary.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin and currency, herein prescribed.
 
The Securities will be redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the Company's option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities then outstanding to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Securities to be redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the applicable Treasury Rate plus 25 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date.
 
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date: (i) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the remaining life (as defined below), yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month) or (ii) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
 
The Treasury Rate will be calculated by the Independent Investment Banker on the third business day preceding the date fixed for redemption.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the U.S. Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term ("remaining life") of the Securities to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining life of the Securities.
 
"Comparable Treasury Price" means (1) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
 
"Independent Investment Banker" means either Barclays Capital Inc. or Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, as specified by the Company, or, if these firms are unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means (1) Barclays Capital Inc. and Credit Suisse First Boston LLC and their respective successors, provided, however, that if either of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. government securities dealer in New York City (a "primary treasury dealer"), the Company will substitute therefor another primary treasury dealer and (2) any other primary treasury dealer selected by the Company after consultation with the Independent Investment Banker.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding such redemption date.
 
The Company will mail a notice of redemption to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed by first-class mail at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption. Unless the Company defaults on the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities or portions thereof called for redemption on the redemption date. If fewer than all of the Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select, not more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, the particular Securities or portions thereof for redemption from the Outstanding Securities not previously called by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate.
 
Section 4.03 (including subparagraph (4) thereof and clause (B), but not clause (A), of such subparagraph) and Section 10.10 (including subparagraph (5) thereof) of the Indenture contain provisions applicable to this Security that provide for defeasance at any time of (a) the entire indebtedness on this Security and (b) certain restrictive covenants and certain Events of Default upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Security may be registered for transfer on the Security Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the registered Holder hereof or its attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
The Company may, from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the Holders of the Securities, increase the aggregate principal amount of the Securities which may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture and issue such increased principal amount (or any portion thereof), in which case any additional Securities so issued will have the same form and terms (other than the date of issuance and, under certain circumstances, the date from which interest thereon will begin to accrue), and will carry the same right to receive accrued and unpaid interest, as the Securities previously issued, and such additional Securities will form a single series with the Securities.
 
The Securities are issuable only as Registered Securities in denominations of integral multiples of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture, and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Registered Securities of different authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company or the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to the Securities shall occur, the principal of all the Securities may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities under the Indenture at any time by the Company with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
 
the then Outstanding Securities of this series and of each other series issued under the Indenture and affected by such amendment or modification. The Indenture also permits the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities, to waive certain past defaults under the Indenture with respect to the Securities and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver shall be conclusive and binding upon the Holder of this Security and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not a notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or any successor Person, either directly or through the Company, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.
 
Except as otherwise defined herein, all terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
This Security shall be deemed to be a contract made under the laws of the State of New York and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of said State.
 
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee by the manual signature of one of its authorized officers, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under said Indenture, or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.
