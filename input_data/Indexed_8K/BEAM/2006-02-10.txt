Further, Fortune Brands may terminate the Merger Agreement if any of SBR's principal stockholders breach or fail to perform its covenants or other agreements in the applicable voting agreement entered into in connection with the Merger Agreement.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Fortune Brands, Inc., 520 Lake Cook Road, Deerfield, IL 60015
 
 
 
 
Deerfield, IL, February 10, 2006  Fortune Brands, Inc. today announced a definitive agreement to acquire SBR, Inc. and its leading brands in the growing markets for vinyl-framed windows and composite millwork.
 
The largest brand of privately-held SBR is Simonton Windows, the fast-growing #3 vinyl-framed window brand in North America and a leader in the replacement window category.
 
Simonton, which accounts for more than three quarters of SBR's approximately $565 million in annual revenues, is an innovative brand that benefits from several favorable industry trends in the fragmented $10 billion windows market.
 
 
"This acquisition is another excellent high-return growth opportunity and the next logical step in building our successful Home & Hardware business," said Fortune Brands chairman and chief executive officer Norm Wesley. "As a leader in the most attractive segment of the windows market  highly-profitable vinyl replacement windows 
 
Fortune Brands Announces Home Products Acquisition, Page 2
 
Simonton is a strong and growing brand with unsurpassed nationwide reach. With its innovative StormBreaker Plus windows, Simonton is also number one and growing in the rapidly expanding vinyl hurricane-resistant window category. Just as we're seeing our Therma-Tru fiberglass entry doors gain share from wood and steel, vinyl has become the material of choice in windows and that trend is expected to continue, especially as consumers increasingly seek to enhance the energy efficiency and aesthetics of their homes.
 
"We expect this high-return acquisition to be accretive from the start, adding six to eight cents per share in the first 12 months and even more in succeeding years," Wesley continued. The purchase price is approximately $630 million and is within the company's target valuation range for high-return acquisitions. The acquisition will be financed with a combination of stock and debt. "The use of stock for part of the purchase price was very appealing to the seller and gave us added flexibility in making a high-return acquisition at an attractive valuation that we believe serves our shareholders well. At this point, we expect the stock component will be in the range of 60-70% of the total purchase price, contingent on the elections by SBR's shareholders."
 
 
"Simonton benefits from many of the same favorable demographics that support our faucet, cabinet and exterior door brands," said Bruce Carbonari, president and CEO of Fortune Brands Home & Hardware. "With its product quality and innovation, industry-leading commitment to 7-day delivery, national distribution, retrofit market strength and excellent management team, Simonton is well positioned to keep growing share. The addition of SBR's brands also creates opportunities for valuable cost synergies in materials, transportation and best practices across our Home & Hardware business, as well."
 
In addition to the Simonton brand, the acquisition also includes leading brands in adjacent growing markets: Fypon, the #1 brand in the fast-growing urethane millwork market; Dixie-Pacific and Hartmann-Sanders, leading brands of advanced-materials architectural columns and porch railings; and Hy-Lite, the leading brand of acrylic block windows. "We like the adjacent moldings category, which is seeing a migration to the advanced materials that are helping drive growth for Fypon, Dixie-Pacific, Hartmann-Sanders and Hy-Lite," Carbonari added. The acquisition does not include SBR's Woodcraft Supply business.
 
"The acquisition of SBR and our home products brands by Fortune Brands better positions these companies for building their brands and taking our companies to the next level of excellence," said Sam Ross, chairman and chief executive officer of SBR, Inc. "We're especially pleased that the core values and dedication to operational excellence displayed by Fortune Brands so closely match the business strategies that have guided SBR since its inception. We believe this should be a seamless transition of ownership that helps strengthen the future for our companies and employees."

The acquired brands will join the Home & Hardware business of Fortune Brands, which includes Moen, the #1 faucet brand in North America, MasterBrand Cabinets, the #2 kitchen & bath cabinet business, Therma-Tru, the #1 brand of residential entry doors, Master Lock, the world's #1 padlock brand, and Waterloo, the world's largest manufacturer of tool storage. Fortune Brands' home and hardware brands generated more than $4 billion in sales in 2005.
 
SBR is based in Parkersburg, West Virginia, and operates 12 manufacturing facilities in seven U.S. states and one in China.
 
The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close within the next few months.
