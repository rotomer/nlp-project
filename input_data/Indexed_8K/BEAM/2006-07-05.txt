Item 3.01. Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
(a) On June 28, 2006, the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") notified Fortune Brands, Inc. (the "Company") that the Company did not meet the requirements of Section 303A.03 of the NYSE's Listed Company Manual, which, requires disclosure of the method for interested parties to communicate with non-management directors. The Company's Proxy Statement for its 2006 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, in the section titled "Election of Directors - Stockholder Communication," disclosed how stockholders may communicate with non-management directors. Such disclosure, however, did not reference similar communication methods for interested parties who are not stockholders.
Therefore, the Company has set forth such information below. In future years, the Company will include this disclosure, as required, in its Definitive Proxy Statement.
Stockholders, or other interested parties, who wish to communicate with the non-management directors or any individual director should direct their communication c/o the Secretary, 520 Lake Cook Road, Deerfield, Illinois 60015.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
