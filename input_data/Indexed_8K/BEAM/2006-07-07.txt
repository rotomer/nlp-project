Item 8.01. Other Events.
On July 1, 2006, Fortune Brands, Inc. ("Fortune Brands") transferred all the issued and outstanding shares of stock of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Fulham Acquisition Corp. ("Fulham") to its 90% owned subsidiary, Beam Global Spirits & Wine, Inc. ("Beam"). Fulham owns more than 25 spirits and wine brands and other assets that had been acquired from Pernod Ricard S.A. In consideration for the transfer, Fortune Brands received from Beam an additional 405 shares of Beam Common Stock and promissory notes which are approximately equal to the costs of the acquisition to acquire the spirits and wine brands and other assets from Pernod Ricard S.A.
V&S Vin & Sprit AB (PUBL) ("V&S"), the other stockholder of Beam, also contributed $153 million to the capital of Beam and received 45 shares of a newly authorized Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock of Beam.
After these transactions, Fortune Brands continues to own 90% of the capital stock and V&S continues to own 10% of the capital stock of Beam.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
