Exhibit 99.1 Fortune Brands Reports Record Second Quarter Results DEERFIELD, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 27, 2006--Fortune Brands, Inc. (NYSE:FO): -- Broad-Based Growth Across Consumer Categories Fuels Continued Share Gains and Double-Digit EPS Growth -- Company Exceeds Second Quarter Earnings Target, Delivers 20th Quarter in a Row of Double-Digit EPS Growth Before Charges/Gains Fortune Brands, Inc. (NYSE:FO), a leading consumer brands company, today reported double-digit growth in earnings per share for the second quarter of 2006. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 34%, benefiting from solid organic sales growth, the success of the 2005 spirits and wine acquisition and a net gain from state tax-related credits. Consumer demand across the company's brand portfolio - including Moen faucets, Omega and Aristokraft cabinetry, Master Lock security products, Jim Beam and Maker's Mark bourbon, Sauza tequila and Titleist golf balls - fueled sales growth and share gains in key markets. "Fortune Brands delivered another strong quarter of double-digit earnings growth that exceeded the earnings target we provided three months ago," said Fortune Brands chairman and CEO Norm Wesley. "This was the 20th consecutive quarter that Fortune Brands has achieved double-digit growth in earnings per share on a before charges/gains basis, underscoring how Fortune Brands' breadth and balance across high-return consumer businesses enhances our ability to consistently deliver strong results." "Our home products brands outperformed a moderating housing market on the strength of our innovations in function and style and the stability of the replace-and-remodel segment. In spirits and wine, the addition of the brands we acquired last July, the enhanced scale and quality of our portfolio, and a lower cost structure helped fuel our strong spirits-and-wine results. The soft spot in the quarter was in sales of golf clubs, which had a strong first quarter but declined against a strong double-digit increase in the year-ago quarter. Even so, we benefited from our unrivalled breadth across the golf category as sales of golf balls, shoes, gloves and accessories all grew solidly in the quarter." For the second quarter, on a continuing operations basis: - -0- *T - -- Net income was $248 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, up 34% from $1.22 in the year-ago quarter. -- Results reflected a net gain of 8 cents per share from one-time items. The net gain resulted from credits related to the favorable resolution of state tax audits ($0.10 per share), partly offset by restructuring and restructuring-related items ($0.01 per share) and currency mark-to-market expense ($0.01 per share) that finalized the previously disclosed purchase price adjustment for the 2005 spirits and wine acquisition. - -- Excluding the net gain, diluted EPS before charges/gains was $1.55, up 17%. -- These results were 5 cents above the mean estimate of Wall Street securities analysts (source: Thomson First Call) and above the company's previously announced second quarter target of high-single-digit to low-double-digit growth. - -- Net sales were $2.3 billion, up 27%. -- On an adjusted basis - assuming the company had owned acquired brands in the year-ago quarter, and excluding excise taxes and foreign exchange - the company estimates total net sales for Fortune Brands would have risen at a mid-single-digit rate. - -- Operating income was $434 million, up 30%. - -- Return on equity before charges/gains was 20%. - -- Return on invested capital before charges/gains was 10%. *T Outlook for Double-Digit EPS Growth for Third Quarter and Full Year "We're very pleased with Fortune Brands' performance in the first half of the year," said Wesley. "Looking ahead to the second half of 2006, even with the impact of moderating new construction activity and higher costs for commodities, we're confident Fortune Brands will continue to benefit from our unique breadth and balance across attractive consumer categories, including our enhanced spirits and wine business, our strength in the growing replace-and-remodel segment of the housing market, and the addition of Simonton Windows. We believe our broad portfolio of powerful and growing consumer brands - such as Moen, Master Lock, Omega, Titleist, FootJoy, Jim Beam, Sauza, Maker's Mark and many more - will continue to drive Fortune Brands' performance. "For the third quarter, including stock options expense and the benefit of the Simonton Windows acquisition, we're targeting EPS before charges/gains to grow at a double-digit rate. For the full year, we now expect to comfortably achieve our goal of double-digit growth in EPS before charges/gains for 2006," Wesley added. The company also announced that it is now targeting free cash flow for 2006 in the range of $450-550 million after dividends and capital expenditures. Included in the target is approximately $50 million in net costs resulting from one-time credits and acquisition-related items that won't be repeated.
