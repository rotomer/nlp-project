Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers.
(d) On September 29, 2006, Fortune Brands, Inc. issued a press release announcing the election of Richard A. Goldstein to the Board of Directors of Fortune Brands. Mr. Goldstein was elected as a Class I member of the Board of Directors effective December 1, 2006 and his term of office will expire at the 2008 annual meeting of stockholders. There is no arrangement or understanding between Mr. Goldstein and any other persons pursuant to which he was elected as a director. Fortune Brands has not yet named Mr. Goldstein to any committee of the Board of Directors. Mr. Goldstein is the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. Mr. Goldstein retired from International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. on May 9, 2006. He also serves on the Board of Directors of Interpublic Group and Fiduciary Trust Company International. The press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
(a) On September 26, 2006, the Board of Directors of Fortune Brands, Inc. (the "Company") approved amendments to Article I, Section 4 and Article III, Section 2 of the Company's by-laws to reflect the relocation earlier this year of the Company's headquarters from Lincolnshire, Illinois to Deerfield, Illinois. The amendment provides for the Company's books to be held at the Company's office in Deerfield, Illinois, or elsewhere outside of the State of Delaware, and that no notice of regular meetings of the Board of Directors need be given unless the meeting is to be held at any place other than the office of the Company in Deerfield, Illinois.
On September 26, 2006, the Board of Directors also approved an amendment to Article II, Section 4 of the Company's by-laws to adopt a majority vote standard in an uncontested election of directors. The amendment provides that directors will be elected by a majority of the votes cast, except that in any election in which the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, then the directors will be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote (or a "Contested Election"). A "majority of votes cast" means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed 50% of the votes cast with respect to that director. If a director does not receive a majority of the votes cast, the director shall promptly tender his or her resignation following certification of the stockholder vote. The resignation will be effective only upon the acceptance by the Board of Directors. The Company's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") will consider the resignation and make a recommendation to the Board of Directors on whether to accept or reject the resignation or whether any other action should be taken. The Board of Directors will act on the Committee's recommendation within 90 days following certification of the stockholder vote and will promptly publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The amendment also provides that any director who tenders his or her resignation shall not participate in the Committee or Board of Directors recommendation or deliberations. However, if directors who have tendered resignations constitute a majority of the directors then in office, with respect to each tendered resignation, all directors, other than the director who tendered the particular resignation under consideration, may participate in deliberations and action regarding whether to accept or reject the tendered resignations.
These amendments to the Company's By-laws became effective on September 26, 2006.
The foregoing description of the amendments to the Company's By-laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the By-laws, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 3.1(ii) and incorporated herein by reference.

Section 5. The Board of Directors, by resolution adopted by a majority of the entire Board, may appoint from among its members an Executive Committee which shall have at least three members. To the extent provided in such resolution, such committee shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board, including the power to authorize the seal of the Company to be affixed to all papers that require it, except that such committee shall not have such power and authority in reference to
(1) amending the Certificate of Incorporation (except that such committee may, to the extent authorized in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of shares of stock adopted by the Board of Directors as provided in Section 151(a) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, fix the designations and any of the preferences or rights of such shares relating to dividends, redemption, dissolution, any distribution of assets of the Company or the conversion into, or the exchange of such shares for, shares of any other class or classes or any other series of the same or any
other class or classes of stock of the Company or fix the number of shares of any series of stock or authorize the increase or decrease of the shares of any series);
(2) adopting an agreement of merger or consolidation under Sections 251 or 252 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware;

Actions taken at a meeting of such committee shall be reported to the Board of Directors at its next meeting following such committee meeting; except that, when the meeting of the Board is held within two days after the committee meeting, such report shall be made to the Board at either its first or second meeting following such committee meeting.
Section l. The annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company for the election of directors, and such other business as may properly come before the meeting, shall be held on the last Tuesday of the month of April at 1:30 p.m. in the afternoon, or such other day and hour as designated by the directors. If the day fixed for the meeting is a legal holiday, the meeting shall be held at the same hour on the next business day which is not a legal holiday.
Section 2. Special meetings of the stockholders, to be held at such place as may from time to time be designated by the directors, may be called only by the Chairman of the Board, the President or the Board of Directors, by resolution adopted by a majority of the entire Board, for such purposes as shall be specified in the call.
Section 3. Except as otherwise provided by law, due notice of each annual meeting of the stockholders shall be given by a written or printed notice signed by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company and mailed, postage prepaid, at least ten days prior to such meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote thereat appearing on the books of the Company at the address given thereon.
Due notice of each special meeting shall be given also in the manner above provided. The notice shall state the object of the special meeting, and no other business shall be transacted at such meeting.
Section 4. The holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of stockholders. Except as otherwise required by law, or the Certificate of Incorporation or these by-laws, the affirmative vote of shares representing a majority in voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at a meeting at which a quorum is present and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders.
In any election of directors at any meeting of the stockholders in which the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected (a "Contested Election"), the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. In any election by the stockholders of directors other than a Contested Election, each director shall be elected by a majority of the votes cast with respect to the director. A majority of votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed 50% of the votes cast (including those "withheld") with respect to the director.
A director who is not elected at any meeting of the stockholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is present shall promptly tender his or her resignation following certification of the stockholder vote. Such resignation will be effective only upon the acceptance thereof by the Board of Directors.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall promptly consider the tendered resignation, and a range of possible responses based on the circumstances, if known, that led to the election results, and make a recommendation to the Board of Directors on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether any other action should be taken with respect thereto. The Board of Directors will act on any such recommendation by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee within 90 days following certification of the stockholder vote and will promptly publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Any director who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to this provision shall not participate in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or Board of Directors recommendation or deliberations regarding whether to accept the resignation offer or take other action. If directors who have tendered resignations constitute a majority of the directors then in office, then, with respect to each tendered resignation, all directors, other than the director who tendered the particular resignation under consideration, may participate in the deliberations and action regarding whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation or to take other action with respect thereto.
The stockholders present at a duly convened meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.
Section 5. Each meeting of the stockholders, whether annual or special, shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board if present, and if he is not present by the President if present. If neither officer specified in the preceding sentence is present, the meeting shall be presided over by the person designated in writing by the Chairman of the Board, or if the Chairman of the Board has made no designation, by the person designated by the President, or if the President has made no designation, by the person designated by the Board of Directors. If neither officer specified in the first sentence of this section is present, and no one designated by the Chairman of the Board or the President or the Board of Directors is present, the meeting may elect any stockholder of record who is entitled to vote for directors, or any person present holding a proxy for such a stockholder, to preside. The Secretary of the Company (or in his absence any Assistant Secretary) shall be the Secretary of any such meeting; in the absence of the Secretary and Assistant Secretaries, any person may be elected by the meeting to act as Secretary of the meeting.
Section 6. Any voting proxy given by a stockholder must be in writing, executed by the stockholder, or, in lieu thereof, to the extent permitted by law, may be transmitted in a telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission setting forth or submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. A copy, facsimile transmission or other reliable reproduction of a written or electronically-transmitted proxy authorized by this Section 6 may be substituted for or used in lieu of the original writing or electronic transmission to the extent permitted by law.
Section 7. Any previously scheduled annual or special meeting of stockholders may, by resolution of the Board of Directors, be postponed upon public announcement made prior to the date previously scheduled for such meeting of stockholders. For purposes of this Article II, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The person presiding over any meeting of stockholders, or a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, even if less than a quorum, may adjourn the meeting from time to time. No notice of the time and 10-30-90 place of adjourned meetings need be given except as required by law.
Section 8. The directors shall appoint one or more inspectors of election and of the vote at any time prior to the date of any meeting of stockholders at which an election is to be held or a vote is to be taken. In the event any inspector so appointed is absent from such meeting or for any other reason fails to act as such at the meeting, the person presiding pursuant to these By-laws may appoint a substitute who shall have all the powers and duties of such inspector. The inspector or inspectors so appointed shall act at such meeting, make such reports thereof and take such other action as shall be provided by law and as may be directed by the person presiding over the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his ability.
Section 9. The directors may, at any time prior to any annual or special meeting of the stockholders, adopt an order of business for such meeting which shall be the order of business to be followed at such meeting. The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at such meeting shall be announced at such meeting by the person presiding over such meeting.
Section l0. At any meeting of stockholders a stock vote shall be taken on any resolution or other matter presented to the meeting for action if so ordered by the person presiding over the meeting or on the demand of any stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting or any person present holding a proxy for such a stockholder. Such order or demand for a stock vote may be made either before or after a vote has been taken on such resolution or other matter in a manner other than by stock vote and before or after the result of the vote taken otherwise than by stock vote has been announced. The result of a stock vote taken in accordance with this By-law shall supersede the result of any vote previously taken in any manner other than by stock vote.
Section 11. (A) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Company may be made as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation. The proposal of other business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders (1) pursuant to the Company's notice of meeting, (2) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (3) by any stockholder of the Company who was a stockholder of record at the time of giving of the notice provided for in this Section 11, who is entitled to vote thereon at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 11.
(B) For business (other than the nomination of persons for election to the Board of Directors) to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (3) of paragraph (A) of this Section 11, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Company. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary not later than one hundred twenty (120) days in advance of such meeting. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (1) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made and (2) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made (a) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Company's books, and of such beneficial owner and (b) the class and number of shares of the Company which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner.

(D) In addition to the foregoing provisions of this Section 11, a stockholder shall comply with all applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 11.

Section 1. (A) Each person (an "indemnitee") who was or is made or threatened to be made a party to or was or is involved (as a witness or otherwise) in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative was or is a director, officer or employee of the Company or was or is serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding was or is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Company to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees and retainers therefor, judgments, fines, excise taxes or penalties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that except as provided in Section 3 of this Article XIII with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to indemnification, the Company shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company.
(B) The right to indemnification conferred in this Article XIII is and shall be a contract right. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article XIII shall include the right to be paid by the Company the expenses (including attorneys' fees and retainers therefor) reasonably incurred in connection with any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition, such advances to be paid by the Company within 20 days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements from the indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time; provided, however, that if the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the Company of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article XIII or otherwise.
Section 2. (A) To obtain indemnification under this Article XIII, an indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent
the indemnitee is entitled to indemnification. Upon written request by an indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2(A), a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to the indemnitee's entitlement thereto shall be made as follows: (1) if requested by the indemnitee, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined), or (2) if no request is made by the indemnitee for a determination by Independent Counsel, (a) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), or (b) if a quorum of the Board of Directors consisting of Disinterested Directors is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, such quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the indemnitee, or (c) by the stockholders of the Company. In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel at the request of the indemnitee, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the indemnitee unless the indemnitee shall request that such selection be made by the Board of Directors, in which event the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board of Directors. If it is so determined that the indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to the indemnitee shall be made within 10 days after such determination.
(B) In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the person, persons or entity making such determination shall presume that the indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Article XIII, and the Company shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making by any person, persons or entity of any determination contrary to that presumption.
Section 3. (A) If a claim under Section 1 of this Article XIII is not paid in full by the Company within 30 days after a written claim pursuant to Section 2(A) of this Article XIII has been received by the Company, or if an advance is not made within 20 days after a request therefor pursuant to Section 1(B) of this Article XIII has been received by the Company, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit (or, at the indemnitee's option, an arbitration proceeding before a single arbitrator pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association) against the Company to recover the unpaid amount of the claim or the advance and, if successful in whole or in part, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such suit or proceeding (other than a suit or proceeding brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in connection with any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Company) that the indemnitee has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for the Company to indemnify the indemnitee for the amount claimed or that such indemnification otherwise is not permitted under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Company.
(B) Neither the failure of the Company (including its Board of Directors, Independent Counsel or stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the Company (including its Board of Directors, Independent Counsel or stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
(C) If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 2(A) of this Article XIII that the indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to paragraph (A) of this Section 3.
(D) The Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to paragraph (A) of this Section 3 that the procedures and presumptions of this Article XIII are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Article XIII.
Section 4. The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in connection with a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Article XIII shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise.
Section 5. The Company may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. To the extent that the Company maintains any policy or policies providing such insurance, each such director, officer or employee, and each such agent to which rights to indemnification have been granted as provided in Section 6 of this Article XIII, shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage thereunder for any such director, officer, employee or agent.
Section 6. The Company may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and rights to be paid by the Company the expenses incurred in connection with any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, to any agent of the Company to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article XIII with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors, officers and employees of the Company.
Section 7. If any provision or provisions of this Article XIII shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (A) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article XIII (including without limitation, each portion of any Section of this Article XIII containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (B) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article XIII (including, without limitation, each portion of any Section of this Article XIII containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.
Section 8. For purposes of this Article XIII:
(A) "Disinterested Director" means a director of the Company who is not and was not a party to the matter in respect of which indemnification is sought by the indemnitee.
(B) "Independent Counsel" means a law firm, or a member of a law firm, that is experienced in matters of corporation law and neither presently is, nor in the past five years has been, retained to represent: (1) the Company or the indemnitee in any matter material to either such party, or (2) any other party to the matter giving rise to a claim for indemnification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "Independent Counsel" shall not include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the Company or the indemnitee in an action to determine the indemnitee's rights under this Article XIII.
Section 9. Any notice, request or other communication required or permitted to be given to the Company under this Article XIII shall be in writing and either delivered in person or sent by telecopy, telex, telegram or certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to the Secretary of the Company and shall be effective only upon receipt by the Secretary.
