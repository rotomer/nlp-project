Exhibit 99.1 Fortune Brands Reports Second Quarter Results DEERFIELD, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 27, 2007--Fortune Brands, Inc. (NYSE: FO): -- Growth for Premium Spirits & Wine, New Products and Broad-Based Share Gains Boost Results Above High End of Target Range -- Results Benefit from Strong Global Growth for Jim Beam, Sauza, Maker's Mark, Master Lock, Titleist and Cobra -- Home Products Brands Outperform Market Fortune Brands, Inc. (NYSE: FO), a leading consumer brands company, today reported results for the second quarter of 2007. Broad-based market-share gains, strong international sales growth, newly introduced products and the timing of brand spending for spirits and wine helped the company achieve results above the high end of its EPS target range for the quarter. Strong profit growth in the company's Spirits & Wine and Golf businesses largely offset the impact of the downturn in the U.S. housing market on the company's Home products business. "Fortune Brands' unique breadth and balance once again tempered the impact of the downturn in the U.S. housing market," said Norm Wesley, chairman and chief executive officer of Fortune Brands. "Each of our businesses outperformed our expectations in the quarter and we continued to gain share in key consumer categories. Our second quarter results, though still down, were a significant improvement over the first quarter. "Reflecting rising consumer demand for premium brands including Jim Beam, Sauza, Maker's Mark, Teacher's and Clos du Bois, our year-to-date spirits-and-wine case volumes are up at a mid-single-digit rate," Wesley continued. "Operating income for spirits and wine benefited in the quarter from the timing of brand spending that will accelerate in the second half as we launch several new marketing programs. Newly introduced products from Titleist, Cobra and FootJoy drove second-quarter golf sales up double digits. Our strength in the replace-remodel segment and share gains for Moen, Therma-Tru, Master Lock and our cabinetry brands helped us outperform the home products market. We're pleased that in the challenging environment facing our home products - and also against challenging comparisons to last year's very strong results - we achieved results above the high end of our EPS target range for the quarter." For the second quarter of 2007: -- Net income was $232 million, or $1.48 per diluted share, versus $248 million ($1.63 per diluted share) in the year-ago quarter. -- Comparisons were impacted by a restructuring-related charge ($0.05 per share) in the current-year quarter and the absence of a net gain ($0.08 per share) from one-time items in the prior-year quarter. -- Excluding one-time items in both the current and prior-year periods, diluted EPS before charges/gains was $1.53, down 1% from $1.55 in the year-ago quarter. -- These results were above the top of the company's previously announced target range for diluted EPS before charges/gains to be off in the mid-single-digit-to-low-double-digit range. -- Net sales were $2.35 billion, up 4%. -- On a comparable basis - assuming the company had owned acquired brands in the year-ago quarter and excluding excise taxes - the company estimates total net sales for Fortune Brands would have been off approximately 2% in constant currency. -- Operating income was $428 million, down 1%. -- Return on equity before charges/gains was 17%. -- Return on invested capital before charges/gains was 9%. Outlook for Third Quarter and Full Year "Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we continue to expect that our second-half results will be better than the first half," Wesley said. "Reflecting the advantages of our breadth and balance, we'll continue to benefit from the global growth of our premium and super-premium spirits brands, our high-performance golf brands, sustained share gains in home products and our strength in the more stable replace-remodel segment of the home products market. Additionally, we'll face less challenging comparisons to last year's second half results. "For the third quarter, we're targeting diluted EPS before charges/gains to be in the range of up mid-single digits to down mid-single digits, and that takes into account our planned acceleration of brand spending in Spirits & Wine. With the first half behind us, we're in a position to fine-tune our target range for the full year. We're now targeting that Fortune Brands will deliver diluted EPS before charges/gains for 2007 in the flat-to-down-mid-single-digit range as strong full-year performance in Spirits & Wine and Golf help offset lower but improving full-year results in Home & Hardware," Wesley concluded. The company also reaffirmed its full-year target for free cash flow to be in the range of $500-600 million after dividends and capital expenditures.
