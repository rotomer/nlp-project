Exhibit 99.1 Fortune Brands Reports Third Quarter Results DEERFIELD, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 26, 2007--Fortune Brands, Inc. (NYSE: FO): -- Record Third-Quarter Performance for Company's Spirits & Wine Segment Tempers Impact of Housing Downturn -- Home Products Brands Continue to Outperform Challenging Market -- Results Comfortably Achieve Company's Third-Quarter Earnings Target Fortune Brands, Inc. (NYSE: FO), the company behind leading consumer brands including Jim Beam, Moen and Titleist, today reported results for the third quarter of 2007. Profit growth for the company's spirits and wine brands tempered the impact of the downturn in the United States housing market on the company's home products brands. Reported earnings were $1.33 per diluted share, an increase of 36%. Net income comparisons benefited from lower charges from one-time items in the current-year period. Excluding one-time items in both the current and prior-year periods, diluted EPS before charges/gains increased 4% to $1.35. "On the strength of powerful consumer brands like Jim Beam, Maker's Mark, Titleist, FootJoy, Moen and Master Lock, Fortune Brands delivered solid third-quarter results that comfortably achieved our earnings target range," said Norm Wesley, chairman and chief executive officer of Fortune Brands. "The quarter once again demonstrated the benefits of Fortune Brands' unique breadth and balance, as profit growth for our spirits and wine brands helped offset the impact of the U.S. housing correction. We're particularly pleased with our margin performance in the quarter, as operating margins expanded in Spirits & Wine and we limited margin erosion in Home & Hardware to just 50 basis points in a challenging market." Accelerating Investment Behind Spirits Brands "Our spirits and wine brands delivered record third-quarter operating income even with a strong double-digit increase in brand-building investment. We're benefiting from higher pricing on certain premium spirits brands, the favorable trend of consumers trading up to higher end brands, and further synergies from our acquisition of the Allied Domecq brands," Wesley continued. "We're pleased that despite the challenges presented by the housing downturn in the U.S., we're continuing to significantly outperform the home products market. We limited our sales decline in Home & Hardware to just 4%, which underscores how we're gaining share in a home products market that is down double digits. That outperformance reflects the success of innovative new products, growth with key customers, extension into adjacent product categories and expansion in international markets. "With successful new products and double-digit sales increases in golf balls and golf footwear, our golf brands set a third quarter revenue record and gained share in key product categories," Wesley added. For the third quarter of 2007: -- Net income was $209 million, or $1.33 per diluted share, up 36% from $0.98 in the year-ago quarter. -- Comparisons were impacted by a net charge ($0.02 per share) in the current-year quarter related to supply-chain initiatives, and a net charge ($0.32 per share) in the prior-year quarter principally related to required accounting for a minority interest. -- Excluding one-time items in both the current and prior-year periods, diluted EPS before charges/gains was $1.35, up 4% from $1.30 in the year-ago quarter. -- Results reflected a 4-cents-per-share benefit from a reduction in the company's year-to-date effective tax rate. -- These results were within the company's previously announced target range. -- Net sales were $2.20 billion, down 1%. -- On a comparable basis, excluding excise taxes and foreign exchange, the company estimates total net sales for Fortune Brands would have been down 2%. -- Operating income was $376 million, down 1%. -- Return on equity before charges/gains was 16%. -- Return on invested capital before charges/gains was 9%. Outlook for Fourth Quarter and Full Year "For the remainder of the year, we expect Fortune Brands to continue benefiting from global growth of our premium and super-premium spirits brands plus sustained share gains in the challenging home products market," said Wesley. "We believe Fortune Brands is on track to deliver solid fourth-quarter performance as well as full-year results within the target range we established at the beginning of the year. For the fourth quarter, we're targeting diluted EPS before charges/gains to be in the range of up low-single digits to down mid-single digits against the $1.42 we delivered in the fourth quarter of 2006. With three quarters now behind us, we're in a position to further refine our target range for the year. For 2007, we currently expect diluted EPS before charges/gains to be down in the range of low-to-mid-single digits, and that's against $5.33 in 2006." The company also estimates that free cash flow for 2007 will be in the range of $500-550 million after dividends and capital expenditures.
