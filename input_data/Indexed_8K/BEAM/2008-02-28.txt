(e) On February 25, 2008, the Compensation and Stock Option Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Fortune Brands, Inc. (the "Company") approved a new retention program for employees, including certain executive officers of the Company. The supplemental program consists of a grant of restricted stock units, including to Mark Hausberg, Christopher J. Klein, Craig P. Omtvedt, and Mark A. Roche. Each restricted stock unit represents the contingent right to receive one share of the Company's common stock. The Committee approved a form of Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (the "RSU Agreement") to be entered into between the Company and each of these executive officers, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference. Each RSU Agreement provides that if the executive officer remains employed with the Company through December 31, 2010 and certain performance goals are met, the restricted stock unit award will vest and be payable in shares of the Company's common stock in the following amounts:
 
The RSU Agreement provides for the awards to be paid in January 2011, although payment may be accelerated if interim performance targets specified by the Committee are satisfied and in certain other limited circumstances.
On February 25, 2008, due to Bruce A. Carbonari's recent promotion to President and Chief Executive Officer, the Committee granted him options to purchase 200,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The terms and conditions of this stock option award are substantially the same as previous option awards granted by the Committee except that these options will vest annually in three equal installments beginning February 25, 2011 and ending on February 25, 2013. These options will expire seven years from the date of the grant.
On February 25, 2008, the Committee also approved a Restricted Stock Unit Agreement to be entered into between the Company and Norman H. Wesley (the "Wesley RSU Agreement"). The Wesley RSU Agreement provides for an award of 50,000 restricted stock units. Each restricted stock unit represents the contingent right to receive one share of the Company's common stock. Payment will only be made if Mr. Wesley either (a) remains employed with the Company through December 31, 2010 or (b) if he retires prior to that date, he strictly adheres to certain non-compete and confidentiality covenants until December 31, 2010. The Wesley RSU Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.
The summaries of the RSU Agreement and the Wesley RSU Agreement above are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the attached exhibits to this Form 8-K.
 
The following are filed as exhibits to this report pursuant to Item 5.02(e):

In the event of the Executive's Disability, distribution of Common Stock due under this Agreement shall be made as soon as practicable following the Executive's Disability to the Executive or the Executive's other personal representative.

10. . Restricted Stock Units awarded under this Agreement, and any rights and privileges pertaining thereto, may not be transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated in any manner, by operation of law or otherwise, other than by the Executive to a trust for estate planning purposes, or by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process.
Nontransferability
11. . The Executive shall earn dividend equivalents on all Restricted Stock Units awarded under this Agreement on the date of payment of shares pursuant to an Award under this Agreement.

The Company may withhold such required amounts from future paychecks to the Executive or from, if applicable, such dividend equivalents or may require that the Executive deliver to the Company the amounts to be withheld. In addition, upon any payment of shares to the Executive under this Agreement, the Executive may pay any Federal income and other tax withholding (and any state and local income tax withholding, if applicable) by electing either to have the Company withhold a portion of the shares of Common Stock otherwise deliverable to the Executive, or to deliver other shares of Common Stock owned by the Executive, in either case having a fair market value (on the date that the amount of tax the Executive has elected to have withheld is to be determined) of the amount to be withheld, provided that the election shall be irrevocable and shall be subject to such rules as the Committee may adopt.
Withholding
 
15. . The granting of Restricted Stock Units shall not in any way affect the Company's right or power to make adjustments, reclassifications or changes in its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, reincorporate, dissolve, liquidate or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets.
No Limitation on the Company's Rights
16. .
