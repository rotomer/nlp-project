On February 3, 2010, Fortune Brands, Inc. ("Fortune Brands" or the "Company") contributed an aggregate of 1,560,000 shares of its common stock, with a corresponding dollar value of approximately $67.2 million, to the Fortune Brands, Inc. Master Retirement Trust and the Fortune Brands Home & Hardware, LLC Retirement Plans Trust (the "Trusts"). The Trusts are tax-qualified trusts that hold the assets for the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans, which provide retirement benefits to certain employees of Fortune Brands. The contribution was made from treasury stock.
The Company made the contribution voluntarily in order to improve the Trusts' funded status, as ERISA rules do not require a contribution at this time. The shares of common stock will be held in segregated accounts in the Trusts, and the Company has appointed an independent fiduciary in order to manage the shares on the Trusts' behalf.
The exhibits listed under Item 9.01 below relate to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Reg. No. 333-159008), filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on May 6, 2009, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated February 3, 2010, filed with the SEC on February 3, 2010, and are filed herewith for incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement.

Ladies and Gentleman:
In my capacity as General Counsel of Fortune Brands, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), I am furnishing this opinion in connection with the Company's issuance of 1,560,000 shares of common stock, par value $3.125 per share (the "Shares"), to the Fortune Brands, Inc. Master Retirement Trust and the Fortune Brands Home & Hardware, LLC Retirement Plans Trust (the "Trusts"), and subsequent resale of the shares by the Trusts from time to time under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Reg. No. 333-159008) (the "Registration Statement") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act on or about the date hereof.
As counsel for the Company, I have examined such documents, including the Registration Statement, the Company's certificate of incorporation and by-laws and certain resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company, and reviewed such questions of law as I have considered necessary and appropriate for the purposes of the opinion set forth below. In rendering the opinion set forth below, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to me as copies. As to certain facts material to this opinion letter, I have relied without independent verification upon oral and written statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company.
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations stated herein, I am of the opinion that the Shares have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
My opinion expressed above is limited to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal laws of the United States of America, and I express no opinion as to the laws of any other jurisdiction. I hereby consent to the inclusion of this opinion letter as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and the reference to me under the caption "Legal Matters." In giving such consent, I do not thereby admit that I am in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act.

Committee
Company Indemnitees

Indemnification Procedure
(ii) In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party notifies an indemnifying party thereof and seeks or intends to seek indemnity from such indemnifying party, such indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and to the extent that it may determine, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, to assume, the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided that, if the defendants in any such action include both such indemnified party and such indemnifying party and such indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict between its position and the position of such indemnifying party with respect to the conduct of the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from
 
or additional to those available to such indemnifying party, in each case, such indemnified party shall have the right to select separate counsel and any local counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party.

(d) . (i) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 5 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party with respect to any Loss referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Loss in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of such indemnifying party on the one hand and of such indemnified party on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Loss, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and of such indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the Losses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5(c) hereof, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding with respect to such Losses.
