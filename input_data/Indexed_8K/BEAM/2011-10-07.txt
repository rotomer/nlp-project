On October 3, 2011, Beam Inc. (formerly Fortune Brands, Inc., the "Company") completed the spin-off of Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. ("Home & Security") by distributing 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Home & Security to holders of the Company's common stock (the "Spin-Off").
To effectuate the Spin-Off, the Company paid a pro rata dividend of one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Home & Security (the "H&S Common Stock") at 11:59 p.m. New York City time on October 3, 2011 for each share of common stock, par value $3.125, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") outstanding as of 6:00 p.m. New York City time on the record date of September 20, 2011. The Spin-Off was completed without the payment of any consideration or the exchange of any shares by the Company's stockholders. On October 4, 2011, as a result of the Spin-Off, Home & Security became an independent public company trading under the symbol "FBHS" on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Spin-Off was completed pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement between the Company and Home & Security, dated as of September 27, 2011 (the "Separation Agreement"). Under the terms of the Separation Agreement, Home & Security paid a cash dividend to the Company in the amount of $500 million immediately prior to the effective time of the Spin-Off.
The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information of the Company giving effect to the Spin-Off, together with the related notes thereto, is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
The description of the Spin-Off contained in Item 2.01 of this report is incorporated herein by reference. As of the date of this report, the Company estimates the total, pre-tax costs associated with the Spin-Off to be in the range of $100 to $115 million, consisting of financial, legal and other separation-related advisory fees (approximately $40 to $50 million) and employee-related costs (approximately $55 to $65 million), which include severance, other termination benefits and share-based compensation expense associated with the modification of awards for the impact of the Spin-Off. The Company expects that substantially all of these costs will be recognized in its financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. As of the date of this report, approximately $20 to $25 million of the estimated cash charges have been paid and the remaining estimated cash charges of approximately $70 to $80 million are expected to be paid in the remainder of fiscal 2011 and in fiscal 2012.
 
(e)     On October 4, 2011, the Company granted equity incentive awards to certain of the Company's officers, including Matthew J. Shattock, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Robert F. Probst, the Company's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The awards were granted pursuant to the Company's 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan") and the terms and conditions filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, which are hereby incorporated by reference.
Mr. Shattock and Mr. Probst received 78,220 and 22,350 restricted stock units ("RSUs"), respectively. Each executive's RSUs vest in one-third increments on October 4, 2013, 2014 and 2015 so long as the executive remains continuously employed by the Company or a subsidiary thereof (unless the executive's employment terminates due to death or disability). However, the RSUs granted to Mr. Shattock, as a "covered employee" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, will not become vested unless and until the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Company's Board of Directors certifies that the Company has attained at least $.50 in cumulative earnings per share for the two-year period commencing on the date of grant. In addition, each RSU will vest if, on or
after a "Change in Control" (as defined in the Plan), the executive's employment is terminated by the Company other than for "Just Cause" or by the executive for "Good Reason" (as such terms are defined in the Plan).
In addition, Mr. Shattock and Mr. Probst received 296,110 and 84,610 options to purchase shares of common stock of the Company ("Options"), respectively. The exercise price for the Options is $44.75, which is the closing price per share of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on October 4, 2011. Each executive's Options vest in one-third increments on October 4, 2013, 2014 and 2015. However, if the executive's employment with the Company or a subsidiary thereof terminates other than by reason of such executive's death or disability, all of such executive's unvested Options will terminate and all of such executive's vested Options will cease to be exercisable three months after the date of termination of employment. If the executive is terminated for "Just Cause" (as defined in the Plan), all of the executive's unexercised Options, whether vested or unvested, will terminate immediately. In the event of a "Change in Control" (as defined in the Plan), all unexpired Options will become immediately exercisable in full.
 
Following the completion of the Spin-Off, effective as of 12:01 a.m. on October 4, 2011, Fortune Brands, Inc. changed its name to Beam Inc. The name change was effected pursuant to Section 253 of the Delaware General Corporation Law by merging Beam Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Fortune Brands, Inc., with and into Fortune Brands, Inc., with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger. The merger had the effect of amending Article I of the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation to read in its entirety as follows:
"The name of the Corporation is Beam Inc. (the "Company")."
A copy of the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, reflecting the name change, is filed as Exhibit 3.1 hereto. The Company's By-laws, which include a corresponding change from the name Fortune Brands, Inc. to the name Beam Inc., are filed as Exhibit 3.2 hereto.
The outstanding shares of Company Common Stock will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange, under the new symbol "BEAM." The new CUSIP number for Beam Inc.'s common stock is 073730 103.
 
(b) Pro Forma Financial Information.
Unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information of the Company required by Article 11 of Regulation S-X is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.

Exhibit 3.1
Beam Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Company"), hereby certifies as follows:
A. The name of the Company is Beam Inc. The original Certificate of Incorporation of the Company was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on October 1, 1985 under the name American Brands Holding Company.
B. This amended and restated certificate of incorporation was duly adopted in accordance with Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended, and amends and restates the provisions of the Company's certificate of incorporation.
C. The text of the certificate of incorporation of the Company is hereby amended and restated to read in its entirety as follows:
The name of the Corporation is Beam Inc. (the "Company").
The address of the Company's registered office in the State of Delaware is 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400, in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle. The name of its registered agent at such address is United States Corporation Company.
The purpose of the Company is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
1. The total number of shares of all classes of stock that the Company shall have authority to issue is eight hundred and ten million (810,000,000) shares, of which seven hundred and fifty million (750,000,000) shares shall be Common Stock, par value $3.125 per share, and sixty million (60,000,000) shares shall be Preferred Stock, without par value. The designations and the powers, preferences and rights of the Common Stock and the Preferred Stock, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, are as provided in or pursuant to this Article IV.
2. (a) The rights of holders of Common Stock to receive dividends or to share in the distribution of assets in the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company shall be subject to the preferences and other rights of the Preferred Stock as may be fixed in this Certificate of Incorporation or in the resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors providing for the issue of such Preferred Stock.
(b) The holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held by them of record at the time for determining the holders thereof entitled to vote.
3. Authority is hereby vested in the Board of Directors to issue from time to time the Preferred Stock in one or more series and to fix by the resolution of resolutions providing for the issue of shares of any such series the voting powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of such series to the full extent permitted by this Certificate of Incorporation and the law of the State of Delaware. The authority of the Board of Directors with respect to each such series shall include, but not be limited to, determination of the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. The number of authorized shares of any class or classes of stock of the Company may be increased or decreased by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Company that is entitled to vote, without a separate class vote of any class or classes of stock of the Company, except as may be otherwise provided in this Certificate of Incorporation or in the resolution or resolutions fixing the voting rights of any series of the Preferred Stock.
5. No holder of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, as such, shall have or be entitled to any preemptive right whatsoever.
6. The shares of Preferred Stock are hereby divided to create a series of Preferred Stock, and it is hereby determined that such series shall consist of 5,514,459 shares, which shall have the following designation, relative rights, preferences and limitations and a stated capital at least equal to the par value of the stock into which such shares are made convertible:
(a) The distinctive serial designation of the series is $2.67 Convertible Preferred Stock (hereinafter called "$2.67 Preferred").
(b) (1) Holders of shares of $2.67 Preferred shall be entitled to three-tenths of a vote per share, and, except as provided in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph (b) or by present or future law otherwise specifically provided, shall not be entitled to vote as a class.
(2) If payment of six or more quarterly dividends (whether or not consecutive) payable on Preferred Stock of any series shall be in default, in whole or in part, the holders of shares of $2.67 Preferred (in addition to any other rights of holders of shares of any series of Preferred Stock to vote, including any right to vote with the holders of Common Stock for the election of directors) shall be entitled, until such time as all such dividends in default have been paid in full, at each annual meeting of stockholders, voting separately as a class with all other holders of Preferred Stock having the right to vote for directors at such meeting regardless of series, to elect two of the directors then being elected. If, while the holders of shares of Preferred Stock as a class are entitled to vote for the election of such two directors, any vacancy occurs among the directors elected by the holders of shares of Preferred Stock, the remaining director so elected by the holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to nominate for election by the Board of Directors a successor director to hold office for the unexpired term of the director whose position has become vacant. If the vacancy is not filled by nomination by the remaining director, or if there is then in office no director who has been elected by the holders of shares of Preferred Stock (whether or not prior to
 
the initial election of any such director), the Company shall, as soon as possible, call (on at least 20 days' notice) a special meeting of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock having the right to vote for directors at such meeting for the purpose of filling such vacancy or vacancies in the Board of Directors. If the Company fails to call such a meeting within 30 days after a written request by any three or more holders of shares of Preferred Stock, then such three or more holders of shares of Preferred Stock may call (on at least 20 days' notice) a special meeting of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock having the right to vote for directors at such meeting for such purpose and, if the vacancy or vacancies are not theretofor filled as hereinabove provided, it or they may be filled at such meeting by the holders of shares of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class regardless of series.
(3) The affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of $2.67 Preferred, voting separately as a class, given in person or by proxy at any special or annual meeting called to take action thereon, shall be necessary to permit, effect or validate any amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, or approve any agreement of merger or consolidation which contains any provision, to (i) exclude or limit the right of the holders of $2.67 Preferred to vote on any matter, except as such right may be limited by voting rights given to new shares then being authorized of any existing or new series of Preferred Stock; (ii) reduce the rate or change the time for accumulation or payment of dividends on the shares of $2.67 Preferred; (iii) cancel or otherwise adversely affect dividends which have accrued but have not been declared on the shares of $2.67 Preferred; (iv) effect a conversion, exchange or reclassification of the shares of $2.67 Preferred; (v) change the designation, preferences, limitations, conversion rate, call provisions or relative rights of the shares of $2.67 Preferred; or (vi) change shares of $2.67 Preferred then outstanding into a different number of shares, or into the same number of shares of another class or series. Nothing herein shall be deemed to restrict or limit the right of the Board of Directors of the Company to create, or authorize the Board to create, a new series of Preferred Stock having, or convertible into shares having, rights or preferences prior or superior to those of the shares of $2.67 Preferred; provided that the Board of Directors of the Company shall not have the right to issue any shares with equal, prior or superior rights to those of the $2.67 Preferred as a dividend or distribution on any junior stock (which shall mean for the purposes of this Section 6 the Common Stock and any other class of stock of the Company hereafter authorized over which the $2.67 Preferred has preference or priority in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company).
(c) (1) The holders of shares of $2.67 Preferred shall be entitled to receive, out of funds legally available therefor, cumulative cash dividends of a limited and preferential nature at a rate of $2.67 per share per annum, and no more, payable quarterly on the tenth day of March, June, September and December commencing March 10, 1986, as and when declared by the Board of Directors. Dividends on each share of $2.67 Preferred shall be cumulative and shall commence to accrue from the date of the original issuance of shares of this series. Accumulations of dividends shall not bear interest.
(2) No dividend shall be paid or declared on any junior stock, other than a dividend payable in junior stock, nor shall any shares of junior stock be acquired for a consideration by the Company or by any subsidiary (which shall mean any corporation or entity, the majority of the voting power to elect directors of which is held directly or indirectly by the Company), unless all dividends on the $2.67 Preferred accrued for all past quarter-yearly dividend periods shall have been paid and unless, in the case of dividends on any junior stock, the full dividends on the $2.67 Preferred for the then current quarter-yearly dividend period provided in accordance with subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (c) shall have been or shall then be paid or declared. The foregoing restriction on acquisition of shares of junior stock shall be inapplicable to any payments in lieu of issuance of fractional shares thereof whether upon any merger, conversion, stock dividend or otherwise.
(d) (1) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holder of each share of $2.67 Preferred then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to its stockholders before any distribution or payment shall be made to the holders of any junior stock, an amount equal to the sum of (i) $30.50 per share plus (ii) an additional sum computed at the rate of $2.67 per share per annum, for the period from the date on which dividends on such share became cumulative to and including the date fixed for such payment, less the aggregate of dividends that on or before the date fixed for such payment shall have been paid or declared and set aside for payment, but computed without interest. If the assets of the Company
 
available for distribution to its stockholders shall be insufficient to pay in full all amounts to which the holders of $2.67 Preferred are entitled, the amount available for distribution to the holders of shares of $2.67 Preferred shall be shared pro rata by them.
(2) Notice of any payment in full pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (d) shall be given by publication at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, printed in the English language and customarily published on each business day, such publication to be not more than 60 days and not less than 30 days prior to the payment date. Notice of such payment shall also be given in the same manner as provided for mailing notice of redemption in subparagraph (2) of paragraph (e) as if the date for payment were the date fixed for redemption referred to in said subparagraph (2), except that such notice shall be mailed not less than 30 days prior to the date fixed for payment. Neither failure to publish or mail such notice nor defect therein or in the publication or mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for such payment.
(3) For the purposes of this Paragraph (d), a consolidation or merger of the Company with any other corporation shall not constitute or be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.
(e) (1) The Company may, at its option, at any time or from time to time redeem the whole or any part of the $2.67 Preferred outstanding at the time of redemption, upon notice given as hereinafter specified, by paying in cash the following redemption prices per share:
 
and thereafter at a redemption price per share of $30.50; together with an additional sum, for each share so to be redeemed, computed at the rate of $2.67 per share per annum for the period from the date on which dividends on such share became cumulative to and including the date fixed for such redemption, less the aggregate of the dividends that on or before the date fixed for such redemption shall have been paid or declared and set aside for payment, but computed without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may not redeem less than the whole of the $2.67 Preferred at the time outstanding unless all dividends on the $2.67 Preferred for all past quarter-yearly dividend periods shall have been paid or declared and set aside for payment.
(2) Notice of any such redemption pursuant to this paragraph (e) shall be deemed given if mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, not less than 90 days prior to the date fixed for redemption, to each stockholder of record of shares so to be redeemed at his address as it appears on the books of the Company. Neither failure to mail such notice nor defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any shares so to be redeemed.
(3) If only part of the $2.67 Preferred at the time outstanding is to be redeemed, the selection of the shares to be redeemed may be made pro rata, by lot or in any other equitable manner. The Board of Directors shall have the power to prescribe the manner in which the selection is to be made.
(4) When any shares of $2.67 Preferred are redeemed out of capital, their redemption shall effect their retirement. When any shares of $2.67 Preferred are otherwise redeemed or reacquired, the Company shall retire such shares by resolution of the Board of Directors. In either event, the Board of Directors shall cause to be filed with the Office of the Secretary of State of Delaware an appropriate certificate which shall have the effect of restoring such shares to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock without series designation.
(f) (1) If notice of payment in full to holders of shares of $2.67 Preferred of the amounts to which they are entitled in accordance with subparagraph (2) of paragraph (d) or notice of redemption in accordance with subparagraph (2) of paragraph (e) shall have been given or if the Company shall have given to the bank or trust company hereinafter referred to irrevocable authority promptly to give or
 
complete such notice, and if on or before the payment date, or redemption date specified therein, the funds necessary for such payment or redemption shall have been deposited by the Company with a bank or trust company in good standing, designated in such notice, organized under the laws of the United States of America or of the State of New York, in trust for the pro rata benefit of the holders of the shares entitled to such payment or so called for redemption, as the case may be, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for shares entitled to such payment or so called for redemption, as they case may be, shall not have been surrendered for retirement, from and after the time of such deposit by the Company, or from and after the time such notice to holders of $2.67 Preferred is given, whichever is later, all such shares shall be deemed no longer to be outstanding and all rights appertaining to such shares shall forthwith terminate, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive from such bank or trust company the funds so deposited, without interest, and the right to exercise on or before but not later than the fifth day next preceding the date fixed for payment or redemption, as the case may be, any privilege of conversion that has not theretofore expired. Any interest accrued on such funds shall be paid to the Company from time to time.
(2) Any funds deposited by the Company pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (f) that shall not be required for such payment or redemption because of the exercise of any right of conversion subsequent to the date of such deposit shall be released and repaid to the Company forthwith. Any funds so deposited that have not been paid by the end of five years from such payment or redemption date shall be released and repaid to the Company forthwith, after which the holders of the shares of $2.67 Preferred entitled to such payment or of the shares of $2.67 Preferred so called for redemption, as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive payment thereof only from the Company, but subject to applicable law.
(g) (1) Subject to the provisions for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of $2.67 Preferred shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, into 1.02 (1-2/100) of a fully paid and non-assessable share of Common Stock of the Company upon surrender to any Transfer Agent for the $2.67 Preferred, or to the Company if no such Transfer Agent exists, of the certificate for the share so to be converted, together with such form of notice of election to convert as may be provided from time to time by the Company. The number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of a share of $2.67 Preferred is hereinafter sometimes called "the conversion rate."
(2) Any share of $2.67 Preferred called for redemption or for which payment is provided upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company may be converted as in this paragraph (g); provided that it is converted at any time on or before but not later than the fifth day next preceding the date fixed for redemption or payment, as the case may be. No allowance or adjustment for dividends on either class of stock shall be made upon conversion, except that where conversion is made of any share of $2.67 Preferred called for redemption or for which payment is provided upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company there shall be paid cumulative cash dividends on the $2.67 Preferred prorated from the next preceding date on which said cash dividends have been paid to the date the shares of $2.67 Preferred shall be deemed to have been converted. Shares of the $2.67 Preferred shall be deemed to have been converted as of the date of the surrender for conversion of the certificates therefor, together with the form of notice provided by the Company duly signed by the holder thereof, and the person entitled to receive shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock on such date.
(3) The number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of each share of $2.67 Preferred shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:
(A) In case the Company shall (i) declare a dividend or other distribution on its Common Stock in shares of its capital stock, (ii) subdivide or combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock or (iii) issue by reclassification or change of its outstanding shares of Common Stock (including any such reclassification or change in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing corporation) any capital stock (all shares so issued to be included in the term "Common Stock" as used in this subparagraph (3)), the conversion rate in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or distribution or of the effective date of such subdivision, combination, reclassification or change shall be adjusted so that the holder of each share of $2.67 Preferred surrendered for conversion after such time shall be entitled to receive the number and kind of shares that he would have owned or have been entitled to receive had such share of $2.67 Preferred been converted immediately prior to such time. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event listed above shall occur.
 
(B) In case the Company shall, while any shares of $2.67 Preferred remain outstanding, enter into any consolidation with or merger into any other corporation wherein the Company is not the surviving corporation, or sell or convey its property as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, and in connection with such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, shares of stock or other securities shall be issuable or deliverable in exchange for the Common Stock of the Company, proper provision shall be made that the holder of any share of $2.67 Preferred may thereafter convert the same into the same kind and amount of securities as may be issuable by the terms of such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance with respect to the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company into which such share of $2.67 Preferred is convertible at the time of such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance.
(C) In case the Company shall fix a record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive rights or warrants to be issued to holders of its Common Stock as such entitling such holders (for a period expiring within 60 days after such record date) to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock at a price per share less than the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock (as defined in clause (E) of this subparagraph (3)) on such record date, then in each such case the conversion rate shall be changed so that on and after such record date it shall be the product obtained by multiplying the conversion rate immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such record date plus the number of additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such rights and warrants, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such record date plus a number of shares of Common Stock equal to that obtained by dividing the aggregate consideration receivable on exercise of such rights or warrants by such Current Market Price. For the purposes of this clause (C), the issuance of rights or warrants (exercisable for a period expiring within 60 days after the record date with respect thereto) to purchase stock or securities convertible into shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to be the issuance of rights or warrants to purchase the maximum number of shares of Common Stock into which such stock or securities are convertible and the aggregate consideration receivable on exercise of such rights or warrants shall be deemed equal to the aggregate consideration receivable for such securities when such rights or warrants are exercised plus the minimum aggregate amount, if any, payable upon conversion of such stock or securities into Common Stock. An adjustment pursuant to this clause (C) shall be made whenever any such rights or warrants are issued, and shall be made as of the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants. In the event that such rights or warrants are not so issued, the conversion rate shall again be adjusted, effective as of the date on which the Board of Directors of the Company determines not to issue such rights or warrants, as if such record date had not been fixed.
(D) In case the Company shall fix a record date for making a distribution (including any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing corporation) on its Common Stock of evidences of its indebtedness or corporate assets (excluding dividends paid in, or distributions of, cash) or subscription rights or warrants (excluding those referred to in clause (C) of this subparagraph (3)), the conversion rate shall be increased effective immediately following such record date to a new conversion rate which shall be the product obtained by multiplying the conversion rate immediately prior to such record date by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock (as defined in clause (E) of this subparagraph (3)) on such record date and of which the denominator shall be such Current Market Price per share of Common Stock less the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive) of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed or of such subscription rights or warrants applicable to one share of Common Stock. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed. In the event that such distribution is not so made, the conversion rate shall again be adjusted, effective as of the date on which the Board of Directors determines not to make such distribution, as if such record date had not been fixed.
 
(E) For the purpose of any computation under clauses (C) and (D) of this subparagraph (3), the "Current Market Price" per share of Common Stock on any record date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices for the 30 consecutive full business days commencing 45 such business days before such record date. For the purpose of this clause (E), the "Current Market Price" per share of Common Stock of American Brands, Inc., a New Jersey corporation organized under an Agreement of Consolidation in 1904 (hereinafter called "American") calculated as provided in this clause (E) for Common Stock of the Company, shall be deemed to be the "Current Market Price" per share of Common Stock of the Company for any relevant period or periods up to the date of issuance of the $2.67 Preferred. The "closing price" of the Common Stock for any day shall be the last sale price regular way on such day, or in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices regular way, in either case as officially quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, or, if the Common Stock is not listed or admitted to trading on such exchange, on the principal national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading, or if the Common Stock is not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the average of the bid and asked prices as furnished by any New York Stock Exchange member firm selected from time to time by the Board of Directors for that purpose or, if such bid and asked prices are not available, such other prices as may be selected by the Board of Directors for the purpose.
(F) No adjustment pursuant to this subparagraph (3) shall be required unless the particular event involved would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the conversion rate; provided, however, that any adjustments that by reason of this clause (F) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and provided further, however, that such adjustment shall be made no later than the earlier of (i) 3 years after the date of the particular event involved, or (ii) the date as to which the aggregate adjustments not previously made would require a total increase or decrease of 1% in the conversion rate. For the purpose of this clause (F), any adjustment not required to be made with respect to the $2.67 Preferred Stock of American under the terms of conversion rate adjustment provisions applicable thereto because the particular event involved did not require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the conversion rate and not carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment pursuant to such terms at the date of issuance of the $2.67 Preferred, shall be taken into account with respect to adjustments required to be made pursuant to this clause (F).
(G) In the event that at any time as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to clause (A) of this subparagraph (3), the holder of any share of $2.67 Preferred thereafter surrendered for conversion shall become entitled to receive any shares of capital stock of the Company other than Common Stock, thereafter the number of such other shares so receivable upon conversion of any share of $2.67 Preferred shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the Common Stock contained in clauses (A) to (F) of this subparagraph (3) and the other provisions of this resolution fixing terms of the $2.67 Preferred with respect to the Common Stock, to the extent they can appropriately apply on like terms to such other shares.
(H) The Company shall, simultaneously with any action that would require an adjustment pursuant to this subparagraph (3), take all necessary action to make the aggregate amount of state capital represented by the outstanding shares of $2.67 Preferred at least equal to the aggregate par value of the shares of Common Stock into which such shares of $2.67 Preferred will be convertible as the result of such adjustment.
(I) Whenever any adjustment is required by this subparagraph (3), the Company shall promptly file with each Transfer Agent, if any, for the $2.67 Preferred a statement describing in reasonable detail the adjustment and the method of calculation used, and mail a copy of such statement to each holder of shares of $2.67 Preferred of record on the date as of which such adjustment was made.
(4) The Company shall at all times on and after the issuance of the $2.67 Preferred keep available for delivery the full number of issued or unissued shares of Common Stock into which all outstanding shares of $2.67 Preferred are convertible.
 
(5) No certificate for a fraction of a share shall be delivered upon the conversion, but, in lieu of any fractional share that would otherwise be required to be delivered in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the Company shall pay to the person otherwise entitled to such fractional share a sum in cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the closing price (as defined in clause (E) of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (g)) of the Common Stock on the day prior to the day of the conversion.
(6) The certificate of any independent firm of public accountants selected by the Board of Directors shall be evidence of the correctness of any adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph (g). All calculations of adjustments under this paragraph (g) shall be made to the nearest one-thousandth of a share.
(7) Conversion of shares of $2.67 Preferred shall effect their retirement. Shares of $2.67 Preferred otherwise reacquired by the Company shall be retired by resolution of the Board of Directors. In either event, the Board of Directors shall cause to be filed with the Office of the Secretary of State of Delaware an appropriate certificate which shall have the effect of restoring such shares to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock without series designation.
7. The designation and amount of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, and the voting powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of the shares of such Series, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, are stated and expressed in Exhibit A attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
Except for any By-law that by its terms states that it may be amended or repealed only by action of the stockholders, the Board of Directors is authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the By-laws of the Company.

No director of the Company shall be personally liable to the Company or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director; provided, however, that the foregoing clause shall not apply to any liability of a director to the extent provided by applicable law (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the Company or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Neither the amendment nor the repeal of this Article IX, nor the adoption of any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article IX, shall be effective with respect to any cause of action, suit, claim or other matter that, but for this Article IX, would accrue or arise prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision.

Designation and Amount.
Section 2.
Dividends and Distributions.
(A) Subject to the provisions for adjustment hereinafter set forth, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, (i) cash dividends in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends contemporaneously declared on the Common Stock of the Company presently of the par value of $3.125 per share ("Common Stock") and (ii) a preferential cash dividend ("Preferential Dividends"), if any, on the tenth day of March, June, September and December of each year (each a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, in an amount equal to $10 per share of Series A Preferred Stock less the per share amount of all cash dividends declared on the Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to clause (i) of this sentence since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock. In the event the Company shall, at any time after the issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, make any distribution on the shares of Common Stock of the Company, whether by way of a dividend or a reclassification of stock, a recapitalization, reorganization or partial liquidation of the Company or otherwise, which is payable in cash or any debt security, debt instrument, real or personal property or any other property (other than cash dividends subject to the immediately preceding sentence and other than a distribution of rights or warrants to acquire any such share, including any debt security convertible into or exchangeable for any such share, at a price less than the Current Market Price of such share), then and in each such event the Company shall simultaneously pay on each then outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company a distribution, in like kind, of 100 times (subject to the provisions for adjustment hereinafter set forth) such distribution paid on a share of Common Stock. The dividends and distributions on the Series A Preferred Stock to which holders thereof are entitled pursuant to clause (i) of the first sentence of this paragraph and pursuant to the second sentence of this paragraph are hereinafter referred to as "Participating Dividends" and the multiple of such cash and non-cash dividends on the Common Stock applicable to the determination of the Participating Dividends, which shall be 100 initially but shall be adjusted from time to time as hereinafter provided, is hereinafter referred to as the "Dividend Multiple". In the event the Company shall at any time after November 19, 1997 declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or split or a combination, consolidation or reverse split of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the Dividend Multiple thereafter applicable to the determination of the amount of Participating Dividends which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive shall be the Dividend Multiple applicable immediately prior to such event multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(B) The Company shall declare each Participating Dividend at the same time it declares any cash or non-cash dividend or distribution on the Common Stock in respect of which a Participating Dividend is required to be paid. No cash or non-cash dividend or distribution on the Common Stock in respect of which a Participating Dividend is required to be paid shall be paid or set aside for payment on the Common Stock unless a Participating Dividend in respect of such dividend or distribution on the Common Stock shall be simultaneously paid, or set aside for payment, on the Series A Preferred Stock.
(C) Preferential Dividends shall begin to accrue on outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issuance of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Accrued but unpaid Preferential Dividends shall cumulate but shall not bear interest. Preferential Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding.
Section 3. The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
Voting Rights.
(A) Subject to the provisions for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 100 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company. The number of votes which a holder of Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to cast, as the same may be adjusted from time to time as hereinafter provided, is hereinafter referred to as the "Vote Multiple". In the event the Company shall at any time after November 19, 1997 declare or pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or split or a combination, consolidation or reverse split of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the Vote Multiple thereafter applicable to the determination of the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled after such event shall be the Vote Multiple immediately prior to such event multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(B) Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Company.
(C) In the event that the Preferential Dividends accrued on the Series A Preferred Stock for four or more quarterly dividend periods, whether consecutive or not, shall not have been declared and paid or set apart for payment, the holders of record of preferred stock of the Company of all series (including the Series A Preferred Stock), other than any series in respect of which the right is expressly withheld by the Certificate of Incorporation or the authorizing resolutions included in the Certificate of Designation therefor, shall have the right, at the next meeting of stockholders called for the election directors, to elect two members of the Board of Directors, which directors shall be in addition to the number required by the By-laws prior to such event, to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders and until their successors are elected and qualified or their earlier resignation, removal or incapacity or until such earlier time as all accrued and unpaid Preferential Dividends upon the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have been paid (or set aside for payment) in full. The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall continue to have the right to elect directors as provided by the immediately preceding sentence until all accrued and unpaid Preferential Dividends upon the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have been paid (or set aside for payment) in full. Such directors may be removed and replaced by such stockholders, and vacancies in such directorships may be filled only by such stockholders (or by the remaining director elected by such stockholders, if there be one) in the manner permitted by law; provided, however, that any such action by stockholders shall be taken at a meeting of stockholders and shall not be taken by written consent thereof.
(D) Except as otherwise required by law or set forth herein, holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for the taking of any corporate action.
Section 4.
Certain Restrictions.
(A) Whenever Preferential Dividends or Participating Dividends are in arrears or the Company shall be in default of payment thereof, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid Preferential Dividends and Participating Dividends, whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid or set aside for payment in full, and in addition to any and all other rights which any holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock may have in such circumstances, the Company shall not
(i) declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on, or redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to, the Series A Preferred Stock;
(ii) declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on any shares of stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with the Series A Preferred Stock, unless dividends are paid ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;
(iii) except as permitted by subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph 4(A), redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, provided that the Company may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such parity stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Company ranking junior (both as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock; or
(iv) purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up), except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.
(B) The Company shall not permit any subsidiary of the Company to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Company unless the Company could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
(C) The Company shall not issue any shares of Series A Preferred Stock except upon exercise of Rights issued pursuant to that certain Rights Agreement dated as of November 19, 1997 between the Company and First Chicago Trust Company of New York, a copy of which is on file with the Secretary of the Company at its principal executive office and shall be made available to stockholders of record without charge upon written request therefor addressed to the Secretary. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, nothing contained in the provisions hereof shall prohibit or restrict the Company from issuing for any purpose any series of preferred stock with rights and privileges similar to, different from, or greater than, those of the Series A Preferred Stock.
Section 5. Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof. The Company shall cause all such shares upon their retirement and cancellation to become authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock, without designation as to a series, and such shares may be reissued as part of a new series of preferred stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors.
Reacquired Shares.
Section 6. Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, no distribution shall be made (i) to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock unless the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have received, subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided, (A) $100 per share plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment, or (B) if greater than the amount specified in clause (i)(A) of this sentence, the amount equal to 100 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of Common Stock, or (ii) to the holders of stock ranking on a parity upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up with the Series A Preferred Stock, unless simultaneously therewith distributions are made ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all other shares of such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled under clause (i)(A) of this sentence and to which the holders of such parity shares are entitled, in each case upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. The amount to which holders of Series A Preferred Stock may be entitled upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company pursuant to clause (i)(B) of the foregoing sentence is hereinafter referred to as the "Participating Liquidation Amount" and the multiple of the amount to be distributed to holders of shares of Common Stock upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company applicable pursuant to such clause to the determination of the Participating Liquidation Amount, as such multiple may be adjusted from time to time as hereinafter provided, is hereinafter referred to as the
Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.
"Liquidation Multiple". In the event the Company shall at any time after November 19, 1997 declare or pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or split or a combination, consolidation or reverse split of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the Liquidation Multiple thereafter applicable to the determination of the Participating Liquidation Amount to which holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled after such event shall be the Liquidation Multiple applicable immediately prior to such event multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
Section 7.
Certain Reclassifications and Other Events.
(A) In the event that holders of shares of Common Stock of the Company receive after November 19, 1997 in respect of their shares of Common Stock any share of capital stock of the Company (other than any share of Common Stock of the Company), whether by way of reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization, dividend or other distribution or otherwise ("Transaction"), then and in each such event the dividend rights, voting rights and rights upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted so that after such event the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled, in respect of each share of Series A Preferred Stock held, in addition to such rights in respect thereof to which such holder was entitled immediately prior to such adjustment, to (i) such additional dividends as equal the Dividend Multiple in effect immediately prior to such Transaction multiplied by the additional dividends which the holder of a share of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive by virtue of the receipt in the Transaction of such capital stock, (ii) such additional voting rights as equal the Vote Multiple in effect immediately prior to such Transaction multiplied by the additional voting rights which the holder of a share of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive by virtue of the receipt in the Transaction of such capital stock and (iii) such additional distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company as equal the Liquidation Multiple in effect immediately prior to such Transaction multiplied by the additional amount which the holder of a share of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company by virtue of the receipt in the Transaction of such capital stock, as the case may be, all as provided by the terms of such capital stock.
(B) In the event that holders of shares of Common Stock of the Company receive after November 19, 1997 in respect of their shares of Common Stock any right or warrant to purchase Common Stock (including as such a right, for all purposes of this paragraph, any security convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock) at a purchase price per share less than the Current Market Price (as hereinafter defined) of a share of Common Stock on the date of issuance of such right or warrant, then and in each such event the dividend rights, voting rights and rights upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted so that after such event the Dividend Multiple, the Vote Multiple and the Liquidation Multiple shall each be the product of the Dividend Multiple, the Vote Multiple and the Liquidation Multiple, as the case may be, in effect immediately prior to such event multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such issuance of rights or warrants plus the maximum number of shares of Common Stock which could be acquired upon exercise in full of all such rights or warrants and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such issuance of rights or warrants plus the number of shares of Common Stock which could be purchased, at the Current Market Price of the Common Stock at the time of such issuance, by the maximum aggregate consideration payable upon exercise in full of all such rights or warrants.
(C) In event that holders of shares of Common Stock of the Company receive after November 19, 1997 in respect of their shares of Common Stock any right or warrant to purchase capital stock of the Company (other than shares of Common Stock), including as such a right, for all purposes of this paragraph, any security convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock of the Company (other than Common Stock), at a purchase price per share less than the Current Market Price of such shares of capital stock on the date of issuance of such right or warrant, then and in each such event the dividend rights, voting rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall each be adjusted to that after such event each holder of a share of Series A Preferred Stock shall each be entitled, in respect of each share of Series A Preferred Stock held, in addition to such rights in respect thereof to which such holder was entitled immediately prior to such event, to receive (i) such additional dividends as equal the Dividend Multiple in effect immediately prior to such event multiplied, first, by the additional dividends to which the holder of a share of Common Stock shall be entitled upon exercise of such right or warrant by virtue of the stock capital which could be acquired upon such exercise and
multiplied again by the Discount Fraction (as hereinafter defined) and (ii) such additional voting rights as equal the Vote Multiple in effect immediately prior to such event multiplied, first, by the additional voting rights to which the holder of a share of Common Stock shall be entitled upon exercise of such right or warrant by virtue of the capital stock which could be acquired upon such exercise and multiplied again by the Discount Fraction and (iii) such additional distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company as equal the Liquidation Multiple in effect immediately prior to such event multiplied, first, by the additional amount which the holder of a share of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company upon exercise of such right or warrant by virtue of the capital stock which could be acquired upon such exercise and multiplied again by the Discount Fraction. For purposes of this paragraph, the "Discount Fraction" shall be a fraction the numerator of which shall be the difference between the Current Market Price (as hereinafter defined) of a share of the capital stock subject to a right or warrant distributed to holders of shares of Common Stock of the Company as contemplated by this paragraph immediately after the distribution thereof and the purchase price per share for such share of capital stock pursuant to such right or warrant and the denominator of which shall be the Current Market Price of a share of such capital stock immediately after the distribution of such right or warrant.
(D) For purposes of this Section 7, the "Current Market Price" of a share of capital stock of the Company (including a share of Common Stock) on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices per share thereof over the 30 consecutive Trading Days (as such term is hereinafter defined) immediately prior to such date; provided, however, that, in the event that such Current Market Price of any such share of capital stock is determined during a period which includes any date that is within 30 Trading Days after the ex-dividend date for (i) a dividend or distribution on stock payable in shares of such stock or securities convertible into shares of such stock, or (ii) any subdivision, split, combination, consolidation, reverse stock split or reclassification of such stock, then, and in each such case, the Current Market Price shall be appropriately adjusted by the Board of Directors of the Company to reflect the Current Market Price of such stock to take into account ex-dividend trading. The closing price for any day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the shares are not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the principal
.
consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on the principal national securities exchange on which the shares are listed or admitted to trading or, if the shares are not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market, as reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotation System ("NASDAQ") or such other system then in use, or if on any such date the shares are not quoted by any such organization, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the shares selected by the Board of Directors of the Company. The term "Trading Day" shall mean a day on which the principal national securities exchange on which the shares are listed or admitted to trading is open for the transaction of business or, if the shares are not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, on which the New York Stock Exchange or such other national securities exchange as may be selected by the Board of Directors of the Company is open. If the shares are not publicly held or not so listed or traded on any day within the period of 30 Trading Days applicable to the determination of Current Market Price thereof as aforesaid, "Current Market Price" shall mean the fair market value thereof per share as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company. In either case referred to in the foregoing sentence, the determination of Current Market Price shall be described in a statement filed with the Secretary of the Company.
Section 8. . In case the Company shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged for or changed into the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or other property (payable in like kind), as the case may be, for which or into which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged multiplied by the highest of the Vote Multiple, the Dividend Multiple or the Liquidation Multiple in effect immediately prior to such event.
Consolidation Merger, etc

(B) The Company shall give prompt written notice to each holder of a share of Series A Preferred Stock of the effect of any adjustment to the voting rights, dividend rights or rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company of such shares required by the provisions hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the failure of the Company to give such notice shall not affect the validity of or the force or effect of or the requirement for such adjustment.
Section 10. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable at the option of the Company or any holder thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence of this Section, the Company may acquire shares of Series A Preferred Stock in any other manner permitted by law, the provisions hereof and the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company.
No Redemption.

Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company or a Certificate of Designation relating to a subsequent series of preferred stock of the Company, the Series A Preferred Stock shall rank junior to all other series of the Company's preferred stock as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets on liquidation, dissolution or winding up and senior to the Common Stock.
Ranking.
Section 12. The provisions hereof and the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall not be amended in any manner which would materially affect the rights, privileges or powers of the Series A Preferred Stock without, in addition to any other vote of stockholders required by law, the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds or more of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class.

To the extent provided in such resolution, such committee shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board, including the power to authorize the seal of the Company to be affixed to all papers that require it, except that such committee shall not have such power and authority in reference to

Actions taken at a meeting of such committee shall be reported to the Board of Directors at its next meeting following such committee meeting; except that, when the meeting of the Board is held within two days after the committee meeting, such report shall be made to the Board at either its first or second meeting following such committee meeting.
Section l. The annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company for the election of directors, and such other business as may properly come before the meeting, shall be held on the last Tuesday of the month of April at 1:30 p.m. in the afternoon, or such other day and hour as designated by the directors. If the day fixed for the meeting is a legal holiday, the meeting shall be held at the same hour on the next business day which is not a legal holiday.
Section 2. Special meetings of the stockholders, to be held at such place as may from time to time be designated by the directors, may be called only by the Chairman of the Board, the President, the Board of Directors, by resolution adopted by a majority of the entire Board, or by the Secretary of the Company upon the written request (in accordance with the requirements of this Section 2) of the holders of record of not less than the Requisite Percent (as such term is defined in the Certificate of Incorporation) of the voting
 
power of the Common Stock and $2.67 Convertible Preferred Stock, considered together as a single class, for such purposes as shall be specified in the call.
In order for a special meeting upon stockholder request (a "Stockholder Requested Special Meeting") to be called by the Secretary, one or more written requests for a special meeting (each, a "Special Meeting Request," and collectively, the "Special Meeting Requests") stating the purpose of the special meeting and the matters proposed to be acted upon must be signed and dated by the Requisite Percent of record holders of capital stock of the Company (or their duly authorized agents), must be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company and must set forth: (i) in the case of any director nominations proposed to be presented at such Stockholder Requested Special Meeting, the information required by Article II, Section 11(E) of these By-laws; (ii) in the case of any matter proposed to be conducted at such Stockholder Requested Special Meeting other than a director nomination, the information required by Article II, Section 11(B) of these By-laws; and (iii) an agreement by the requesting stockholder(s) to notify the Company immediately in the case of any disposition of shares of capital stock of the Company owned of record prior to the record date for the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting and an acknowledgement that any such disposition shall be deemed a revocation of such Special Meeting Request to the extent of such disposition, such that the number of shares disposed of shall not be included in determining whether the Requisite Percent has been reached.
In determining whether a special meeting of stockholders has been requested by the record holders of shares representing in the aggregate at least the Requisite Percent, multiple Special Meeting Requests delivered to the Secretary will be considered together only if each such Special Meeting Request (x) identifies substantially the same purpose or purposes of the special meeting and substantially the same matters proposed to be acted on at the special meeting (in each case as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors), and (y) has been dated and delivered to the Secretary within sixty days of the earliest dated of such Special Meeting Requests. Any requesting stockholder may revoke his, her or its Special Meeting Request at any time by written revocation delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company; provided, however, that if following such revocation (or any deemed revocation pursuant to clause (iii) in the second paragraph of this Section 2), the unrevoked valid Special Meeting Requests represent in the aggregate less than the Requisite Percent, there shall be no requirement to hold a special meeting. The first date on which unrevoked valid Special Meeting Requests constituting not less than the Requisite Percent shall have been delivered to the Company is referred to herein as the "Request Receipt Date."
A Special Meeting Request shall not be valid if: (i) the Special Meeting Request relates to an item of business that is not a proper subject for stockholder action under applicable law; (ii) the Request Receipt Date is during the period commencing ninety days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting and ending on the date of the next annual meeting; (iii) the purpose specified in the Special Meeting Request is not the election of directors and an identical or substantially similar item (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, a "Similar Item") was presented at any meeting of stockholders held within the twelve months prior to the Request Receipt Date; (iv) a Similar Item is included in the Company's notice as an item of business to be brought before a stockholder meeting that has been called but not yet held or that is called for a date within ninety
 
days of the Request Receipt Date; or (v) if the record holder is not the signatory to the Special Meeting Request, unless documentary evidence is supplied to the Secretary at the time of delivery of such Special Meeting Request (or within ten business days thereafter) of such signatory's authority to execute the Special Meeting Request on behalf of the record holder.
A Stockholder Requested Special Meeting shall be held at such date and time as may be fixed by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting shall be called for a date not more than ninety days after the Request Receipt Date. The Company will provide the requesting stockholder(s) with notice of the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting. Each requesting stockholder is required to update the information in its Special Meeting Request to provide any material changes in such information as of such record date not later than ten business days after such record date.
Business transacted at any Stockholder Requested Special Meeting shall be limited to (i) the purpose(s) stated in the valid Special Meeting Request(s) received from the Requisite Percent of record holders and (ii) any additional matters that the Board of Directors determines to include in the Company's notice of the meeting. If none of the stockholders who submitted the Special Meeting Request appears or sends a qualified representative to present the matters to be presented for consideration that were specified in the Stockholder Meeting Request, the Company need not present such matters for a vote at such meeting, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such matter may have been received by the Company.
Section 3. Except as otherwise provided by law, due notice of each annual meeting of the stockholders shall be given by a written or printed notice signed by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company and mailed, postage prepaid, at least ten days prior to such meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote thereat appearing on the books of the Company at the address given thereon.
Due notice of each special meeting shall be given also in the manner above provided. The notice shall state the object of the special meeting, and no other business shall be transacted at such meeting.
Section 4. The holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of stockholders. Except as otherwise required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation or these by-laws, the affirmative vote of shares representing a majority in voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at a meeting at which a quorum is present and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders.
In any Contested Election (as hereinafter defined), the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at the meeting of stockholders and entitled to vote on the election of directors. In any election by the stockholders of directors other than a Contested Election, each director shall be elected by a majority of the votes cast with respect to the director. A "majority of votes cast" means that the number of votes cast "for" a director nominee exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that director nominee, with neither "abstentions" nor "broker non-votes" constituting votes cast "for" or "against" a director nominee. A
 
"Contested Election" means an election of directors at a meeting of stockholders for which (i) the Secretary of the Company receives a notice that a stockholder intends to nominate a person for election to the Board of Directors in compliance with the advance notice requirements for stockholder nominees for director set forth in Section 2 of Article VIII of the Certificate of Incorporation and paragraph (E) of Section 11 of this Article II and (ii) such intent to nominate has not been withdrawn by such stockholder on or before the tenth day before the Company first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the stockholder.
If, with respect to an election of directors not constituting a Contested Election and for which a quorum is present, any incumbent director does not receive a majority of the votes cast, such director shall promptly tender his or her resignation following certification of the stockholder vote. Such resignation will be effective only upon the acceptance thereof by the Board of Directors. Such director shall continue in office until such resignation is accepted or, if not accepted, such director's successor shall have been elected and qualified.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall promptly consider the tendered resignation, and a range of possible responses based on the circumstances, if known, that led to the election results, and make a recommendation to the Board of Directors on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether any other action should be taken with respect thereto. The Board of Directors will act on any such recommendation by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee within 90 days following certification of the stockholder vote and will promptly publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Any director who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to this provision shall not participate in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or Board of Directors recommendation or deliberations regarding whether to accept the resignation offer or take other action. If directors who have tendered resignations constitute a majority of the directors then in office, then, with respect to each tendered resignation, all directors, other than the director who tendered the particular resignation under consideration, may participate in the deliberations and action regarding whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation or to take other action with respect thereto.
The stockholders present at a duly convened meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.
Section 5. Each meeting of the stockholders, whether annual or special, shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board if present, and if he is not present by the President if present. If neither officer specified in the preceding sentence is present, the meeting shall be presided over by the person designated in writing by the Chairman of the Board, or if the Chairman of the Board has made no designation, by the person designated by the President, or if the President has made no designation, by the person designated by the Board of Directors. If neither officer specified in the first sentence of this section is present, and no one designated by the Chairman of the Board or the President or the Board of Directors is present, the meeting may elect any stockholder of record who is entitled to vote for directors, or any person present holding a proxy for such a stockholder, to preside. The Secretary of the Company (or in his absence any Assistant Secretary) shall be the Secretary of any such meeting; in the absence of the Secretary and
 
Assistant Secretaries, any person may be elected by the meeting to act as Secretary of the meeting.
Section 6. Any voting proxy given by a stockholder must be in writing, executed by the stockholder, or, in lieu thereof, to the extent permitted by law, may be transmitted in a telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission setting forth or submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. A copy, facsimile transmission or other reliable reproduction of a written or electronically-transmitted proxy authorized by this Section 6 may be substituted for or used in lieu of the original writing or electronic transmission to the extent permitted by law.
Section 7. Any previously scheduled annual or special meeting of stockholders may, by resolution of the Board of Directors, be postponed upon public announcement made prior to the date previously scheduled for such meeting of stockholders. For purposes of this Article II, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The person presiding over any meeting of stockholders, or a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, even if less than a quorum, may adjourn the meeting from time to time. No notice of the time and place of adjourned meetings need be given except as required by law.
Section 8. The directors shall appoint one or more inspectors of election and of the vote at any time prior to the date of any meeting of stockholders at which an election is to be held or a vote is to be taken. In the event any inspector so appointed is absent from such meeting or for any other reason fails to act as such at the meeting, the person presiding pursuant to these By-laws may appoint a substitute who shall have all the powers and duties of such inspector. The inspector or inspectors so appointed shall act at such meeting, make such reports thereof and take such other action as shall be provided by law and as may be directed by the person presiding over the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his ability.
Section 9. The directors may, at any time prior to any annual or special meeting of the stockholders, adopt an order of business for such meeting which shall be the order of business to be followed at such meeting. The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at such meeting shall be announced at such meeting by the person presiding over such meeting.
Section l0. At any meeting of stockholders a stock vote shall be taken on any resolution or other matter presented to the meeting for action if so ordered by the person presiding over the meeting or on the demand of any stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting or any person present holding a proxy for such a stockholder. Such order or demand for a stock vote may be made either before or after a vote has been taken on such resolution or other matter in a manner other than by stock vote and before or after the result of the vote taken otherwise than by stock vote has been announced. The
 
result of a stock vote taken in accordance with this By-law shall supersede the result of any vote previously taken in any manner other than by stock vote.
Section 11. (A) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Company may be made only as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation and, with respect to nominations made by stockholders, in accordance with paragraph (E) of this Section 11. The proposal of other business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders only (1) pursuant to the Company's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto), (2) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (3) by any stockholder of the Company who (a) was a stockholder of record of the Company at the time the notice provided for in this Section 11 is delivered to the Secretary of the Company and at the time of the annual meeting, (b) is entitled to vote at the meeting and (c) complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 11.
(B) For business (other than the nomination of persons for election to the Board of Directors) to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (3) of paragraph (A) of this Section 11, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Company. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary not later than the close of business on the ninetieth day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty days before or more than seventy days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Company). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (1) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made, (2) the name and address of the stockholder giving the notice, as they appear on the Company's books, and of such beneficial owner, (3) the class or series and number of shares of the Company which are, directly or indirectly, owned beneficially or of record by such stockholder or beneficial owner, (4) whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of, or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares) has been made, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to or manage risk or benefit of share price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of, such stockholder or beneficial owner with respect to any share of stock of the Company (which information shall be updated by such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, as of the record date of the meeting not later than 10 days after the record date for the meeting), (5) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business, and (6) a representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group which intends (a) to
 
deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Company's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such proposal. The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder if the stockholder has notified the Company of his or her intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and such stockholder's proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the Company to solicit proxies for such annual meeting.
(C) Only such business shall be conducted at an annual meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 11. Except as otherwise provided by law, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (a) to determine whether any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was proposed in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 11 (including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of such stockholder's proposal in compliance with such stockholder's representation as required by clause (6) of paragraph (B) of this Section 11) and (b) if any proposed business was not proposed in compliance with this Section 11, to declare that such proposed business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual meeting to present a business proposal, such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Company. For purposes of this Section 11, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such stockholder or must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders. For purposes of this Section 11, "public announcement" shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
(D) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 11; provided, however, that any references herein to the Exchange Act or the rules promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit any requirements applicable to proposals as to any other business to be considered pursuant hereto, and compliance with this Section 11 shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to submit proposals (other than matters brought properly under and in compliance with Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act, as may be amended from time to time, and other than nominations brought under and in compliance with the Restated Certificate of Incorporation). Nothing in this Section 11 shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Company's proxy statement pursuant to applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act.
 
(E) The written notice of any nomination for the election of directors to be made by a stockholder pursuant to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall include, in addition to the information required to be submitted by such stockholder thereunder, the following: (1) the class or series and number of shares of the Company which are, directly or indirectly, owned beneficially or of record by the stockholder giving the notice or the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made, (2) whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of, or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares) has been made, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to or manage risk or benefit of share price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of, such stockholder or beneficial owner with respect to any share of stock of the Company (which information shall be updated by such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, as of the record date of the meeting not later than 10 days after the record date for the meeting), and (3) a representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group which intends (a) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Company's outstanding capital stock required to elect the nominee or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such nomination.

Section 1. The Board of Directors, by resolution adopted by a majority of the entire Board, shall appoint a Committee on Conflicts of Interests which shall have at least three members. To the extent provided by resolution of the Board, such committee shall have the power to interpret, administer and apply the policies of the Company as established by the Board from time to time with respect to conflicts of interests.
Section 1. Dividends on the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock of the Company may be declared by the Board of Directors, at any regular or special meeting, as provided by law and the Certificate of Incorporation.
Section 1. The Board of Directors shall, except as otherwise provided in these By-laws or the Certificate of Incorporation, have the power to alter, amend or repeal these By-laws at any meeting by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the directors then in office, provided notice of the proposed alteration, amendment or repeal be given in writing to each of the directors, and provided also that no alteration, amendment or repeal of a specification in any section of these By-laws of a stated fraction of directors as the minimum number whose presence or vote is requisite for action under such section may be made without the presence or vote or both, as the case may be, of the minimum number so specified.
 
Section 1. (A) Each person (an "indemnitee") who was or is made or threatened to be made a party to or was or is involved (as a witness or otherwise) in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative was or is a director, officer or employee of the Company or was or is serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding was or is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Company to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees and retainers therefor, judgments, fines, excise taxes or penalties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that except as provided in Section 3 of this Article XIII with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to indemnification, the Company shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company.
(B) The right to indemnification conferred in this Article XIII is and shall be a contract right. No amendment to this Article XIII shall affect any right or protection of an indemnitee in respect of acts or omissions of such indemnitee occurring prior to such amendment. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article XIII shall include the right to be paid by the Company the expenses (including attorneys' fees and retainers therefor) reasonably incurred in connection with any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition, such advances to be paid by the Company within 20 days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements from the indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time; provided, however, that if the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the Company of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer, to
 
repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article XIII or otherwise.
Section 2. (A) To obtain indemnification under this Article XIII, an indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the indemnitee is entitled to indemnification. Upon written request by an indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2(A), a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to the indemnitee's entitlement thereto shall be made as follows: (1) if requested by the indemnitee, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined), or (2) if no request is made by the indemnitee for a determination by Independent Counsel, (a) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), or (b) if a quorum of the Board of Directors consisting of Disinterested Directors is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, such quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the indemnitee, or (c) by the stockholders of the Company. In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel at the request of the indemnitee, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the indemnitee unless the indemnitee shall request that such selection be made by the Board of Directors, in which event the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board of Directors. If it is so determined that the indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to the indemnitee shall be made within 10 days after such determination.
(B) In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the person, persons or entity making such determination shall presume that the indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Article XIII, and the Company shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making by any person, persons or entity of any determination contrary to that presumption.
Section 3. (A) If a claim under Section 1 of this Article XIII is not paid in full by the Company within 30 days after a written claim pursuant to Section 2(A) of this Article XIII has been received by the Company, or if an advance is not made within 20 days after a request therefor pursuant to Section 1(B) of this Article XIII has been received by the Company, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit (or, at the indemnitee's option, an arbitration proceeding before a single arbitrator pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association) against the Company to recover the unpaid amount of the claim or the advance and, if successful in whole or in part, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such suit or proceeding (other than a suit or proceeding brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in connection with any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Company) that the indemnitee has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for the Company to indemnify the indemnitee for the amount claimed or that such indemnification otherwise is not permitted under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Company.
 
(B) Neither the failure of the Company (including its Board of Directors, Independent Counsel or stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the Company (including its Board of Directors, Independent Counsel or stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
(C) If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 2(A) of this Article XIII that the indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to paragraph (A) of this Section 3.
(D) The Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to paragraph (A) of this Section 3 that the procedures and presumptions of this Article XIII are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Article XIII.
Section 4. The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in connection with a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Article XIII shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise.
Section 5. The Company may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. To the extent that the Company maintains any policy or policies providing such insurance, each such director, officer or employee, and each such agent to which rights to indemnification have been granted as provided in Section 6 of this Article XIII, shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage thereunder for any such director, officer, employee or agent.
Section 6. The Company may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and rights to be paid by the Company the expenses incurred in connection with any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, to any agent of the Company to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article XIII with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors, officers and employees of the Company.
Section 7. If any provision or provisions of this Article XIII shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (A) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article XIII (including without limitation, each portion of any Section of this Article XIII containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or
 
unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (B) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article XIII (including, without limitation, each portion of any Section of this Article XIII containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.
Section 8. For purposes of this Article XIII:
(A) "Disinterested Director" means a director of the Company who is not and was not a party to the matter in respect of which indemnification is sought by the indemnitee.
(B) "Independent Counsel" means a law firm, or a member of a law firm, that is experienced in matters of corporation law and neither presently is, nor in the past five years has been, retained to represent: (1) the Company or the indemnitee in any matter material to either such party, or (2) any other party to the matter giving rise to a claim for indemnification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "Independent Counsel" shall not include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the Company or the indemnitee in an action to determine the indemnitee's rights under this Article XIII.
Section 9. Any notice, request or other communication required or permitted to be given to the Company under this Article XIII shall be in writing and either delivered in person or sent by telecopy, telex, telegram or certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to the Secretary of the Company and shall be effective only upon receipt by the Secretary.

Agreement
3. . Each RSU represents the right, subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement, to receive one (1) share of the Company's Common Stock if and when the RSU vests. The RSUs shall be credited to a notional account (the "Account") established and maintained for the Executive. The Account, which shall be the record of the Award under this Agreement, is solely for accounting purposes and shall not require a segregation of any Company assets.

(b) In the event of the Executive's death, the RSUs will become fully vested and payable on the date of such death. In the event the Executive's termination of employment by reason of Disability, provided that the Executive has been in the continuous employ of the Company (and all Subsidiaries) for six months from the Award Date, the Executive will be treated as continuing in employment with the Company (and its Subsidiaries) and the Award shall continue to vest in accordance with the schedule contained in Section 4(a).
(c) Before any RSUs will vest under this Section 4, the Executive must satisfy such performance goals as established by the Committee with respect to Executive's receipt of an award under this Agreement. Such performance goals may apply
individually to Executive, or they may be threshold goals that must be satisfied by Beam Inc. before any Award may become vested. Any applicable performance goals will be set forth in Appendix B to this Agreement.

In the event of the Executive's Disability, distribution of shares of Common Stock due under this Agreement shall be made to the Executive or the Executive's other personal representative.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof or in the Plan, in the event that the Executive's principal employer is a Subsidiary that ceases to be a Subsidiary and the Company neither directly nor through an ownership interest in another company
 
continues to maintain any ownership interest in the Subsidiary, then all then unvested RSUs shall become nonforfeitable as of the Divestiture Date (as defined in the Plan), all as determined by the Committee, and shall be paid to the Executive in shares of Common Stock (or the securities of the successor or acquiring entity, or its parent) or cash. Such payment shall be made within 30 days after the Divestiture Date; provided that if the applicable divestiture is not a "change in control event," within the meaning of Treasury regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code, distribution instead shall be made in accordance with the vesting schedule in Section 4(a).

Payment shall be made to the Executive in shares of Common Stock or cash in accordance with Section 409A of the Code.

Stockholder Records
9. . The Company shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of Common Stock until they have been listed (or authorized for listing upon official notice of issuance) upon each stock exchange upon which outstanding shares of such class at the time are listed, nor until there has been compliance with such laws or regulations as the Company may deem applicable. The Company shall use its best efforts to affect such listing and compliance. No fractional shares shall be delivered. The Executive may not, during any period of time that the Executive is an affiliate of the Company (within the meaning of the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act")) sell shares of Common Stock acquired under this Agreement, unless the offer and sale is made pursuant to (a) an effective registration statement under the 1933 Act, which is current and includes the shares to be sold, or (b) an appropriate exemption from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act, such as that set forth in Rule 144 promulgated under the 1933 Act.

Nontransferability
11. . The Executive shall earn dividend equivalents on all RSUs awarded under this Agreement on the date of payment of shares. Such dividend
Dividend Equivalents
 
equivalents shall be equal to the cash dividends that would have been paid on the shares of Common Stock covered by such RSU had such covered shares been issued and outstanding on any cash dividend record date beginning as of the Award date and ending on the applicable vesting date. In addition, dividend equivalents shall be subject to all other rules and procedures as established by the Committee under the Plan and the vesting conditions in Section 4 above. Dividend equivalents shall be paid in cash on same date that shares of Common Stock are distributed as described in Section 5 or 7 above.
12. . The Executive shall not be entitled to any voting rights with respect to the Company's Common Stock unless a RSU has vested and the share of Common Stock underlying it has been distributed to the Executive.

Binding Effect
14. . Upon any payment to the Executive of shares of Common Stock or dividend equivalents under this Agreement, Federal income and other tax withholding (and state and local income tax withholding, if applicable) may be required by the Company in respect of taxes on income realized by the Executive. The Company may withhold such required amounts from future paychecks to the Executive or from, if applicable, such dividend equivalents or may require that the Executive deliver to the Company the amounts to be withheld. In addition, upon any payment of shares to the Executive under this Agreement, the Executive may pay any Federal income and other tax withholding (and any state and local income tax withholding, if applicable) by electing either to have the Company withhold a portion of the shares of Common Stock otherwise deliverable to the Executive, or to deliver other shares of Common Stock owned by the Executive, in either case having a fair market value (on the date that the amount of tax the Executive has elected to have withheld is to be determined) of the amount to be withheld, provided that the election shall be irrevocable and shall be subject to such rules as the Committee may adopt. For purposes of this paragraph 14, "fair market value" shall mean the average of the high and low prices reported on the New York Stock Exchange for Beam Inc. common stock on the date for which the determination is being made, or such other method of determining "fair market value" as determined by the Committee in its discretion from time to time.
Withholding

No Limitation on the Company's Rights
16. . Nothing in this Agreement or in the Award shall be construed as constituting a commitment, guarantee, agreement or understanding of any kind or nature that the Company shall continue to employ Executive, or as affecting in any way the right of the Company to terminate the employment of Executive at any time. This Agreement shall not in any way affect the terms and provisions of the Plan.
Effect on Employment
17. . This Agreement is the entire Agreement between the parties to it with respect to the Award of RSUs, and all prior oral and written representations are merged in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, this
Entire Agreement and Amendment
 
Agreement shall not in any way affect the terms and provisions of the Plan. This Agreement may be amended, modified or terminated only by written agreement between the Executive and the Company. The headings in this Agreement are inserted for convenience and identification only and are not intended to describe, interpret, define or limit the scope, extent, or intent of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

Exhibit 10.2
You have been granted an award (the "Award") of non-qualified stock options (the "Options") under the Fortune Brands, Inc. 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). Once the Options become exercisable, you will be able to purchase shares of common stock of Beam Inc. ("Beam") at the option price.
The date of grant, the number of shares subject to the Award, the option price per share and the date(s) on which the Options will become exercisable are identified in the electronic, on-line grant acceptance process administered by the Plan's third party administrator (the "Stock Plans Administrator") and the attached Option Award Notice. The Award is not intended to be an incentive stock option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. Unless otherwise specified in these Terms and Conditions, capitalized terms shall have the meanings provided under the Plan.
1. . Except as provided in this paragraph 1 and paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 6, 11 and 12 below, the Options shall become exercisable in three (3) installments, with one-third of the shares covered by the Award first becoming exercisable on the second anniversary of the date of grant and an additional one-third becoming exercisable on each of the third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant, respectively. Except as provided in paragraph 3 below, the Award will expire, and the Option will no longer be exercisable, 10 years from the date of grant (the "Expiration Date").
Exercise
2. . The Award shall not be transferable by you other than in the event of your death, except that it may be transferred pursuant to an approved domestic relations order. During your lifetime, your Award shall be exercisable only by you unless it has been transferred pursuant to an approved domestic relations order, in which case it may be exercisable only by the transferee. Pursuant to paragraph 17 of these Terms and Conditions, you remain responsible for any taxes due upon the exercise of your Award, except to the extent applicable tax law provides otherwise in the case of a transfer pursuant to an approved domestic relations order. With respect to any transfer pursuant to a domestic relations order, such order must be approved in writing by the Senior Vice President, Chief Human Resources Officer, or her delegate.
Transferability of Option
3. . If your employment with Beam or a Subsidiary (your "Employer") terminates by reason of your death, the Options will immediately become exercisable in full and shall continue to be exercisable in full for three years after your death or until the Expiration Date, whichever is earlier, provided that the Options may continue to be exercised for the one-year period from the date of your death, even if this one-year period extends beyond the Expiration Date.
Death
4. . If your employment with your Employer terminates by reason of Disability, as defined in the Plan, provided that you have remained in the employ of Beam or a Subsidiary for at least six months from the date of grant, you will be treated as continuing in employment with Beam for purposes of determining the vesting and exercisability of the
Disability
Options, and the Options will continue to become exercisable in accordance with the schedule in Paragraph 1 and may be exercised through the Expiration Date.
5. . If your employment with your Employer terminates by reason of Retirement, as defined in the Plan, any Options that are exercisable at the time of your Retirement shall continue to be exercisable until the Expiration Date, and any Options that are not exercisable at the time of your Retirement shall not thereafter become exercisable.

6. . If the Company terminates your employment for Just Cause, as defined in the Plan, then all Options subject to the Award, whether or not then exerciseable, will terminate immediately upon such termination of employment.
Termination for Cause

If your employment with your Employer terminates other than in the circumstances referred to in paragraphs 3, 4, 5 or 6, any Options that are not yet exercisable shall not thereafter become exercisable and any Options that are exercisable shall terminate and cease to be exercisable three months from the date of your termination from employment, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs 11 or 12; provided that in no event shall any Options be exercisable after the expiration of 10 years from the date of grant. For the purpose of these Terms and Conditions, and subject to paragraph 12 your employment shall be considered terminated on the date on which your Employer ceases to be a Subsidiary or Joint Venture of Beam, as defined in the Plan, and Beam either directly or through an indirect ownership interest no longer maintains any ownership interest in your Employer.
Termination of Employment
8. . Beam is not obligated to deliver any shares until the shares have been listed on each stock exchange on which Beam's Common Stock is listed and until Beam is satisfied that all applicable laws and regulations have been met. Beam agrees to use its best efforts to list the shares and meet all legal requirements so that the shares can be delivered. No fractional shares will be delivered.
Stock Exchange Listing
9. . For the purposes of the Award, (a) if you transfer between Beam and an entity in which Beam has an equity interest or from one entity in which Beam has an equity interest to another entity in which Beam has an equity interest, without an intervening period, it will not be considered a termination of employment, and (b) any leave of absence granted in writing will not constitute an interruption in your employment.
Transfer of Employment; Leave of Absence
10. .
Adjustments
(a) In the event of any merger, consolidation, stock or other non-cash dividend, extraordinary cash dividend, split-up, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares, reorganization or recapitalization or change in capitalization, or any other similar corporate event, the number and kind of shares that are subject to the Award and the option price per share immediately prior to such event will be proportionately and appropriately adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
 
(b) The determination of the committee of the Board of Directors of Beam administering the Plan (the "Committee") as to the terms of any adjustment is binding and conclusive upon you and any other person who is entitled to exercise an Option subject to the Award.
11. .
Change in Control of Beam
In the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan), all Options, if they are not then immediately exercisable in full and provided that they have not expired, shall become immediately exercisable in full and shall remain exercisable until the Expiration Date. In addition, under certain circumstances as described in Section 12(b) of the Plan, you may have the right to receive cash instead of exercising your Options. This right, called a Limited Right, may be automatically exercised under certain circumstances described in the Plan. You will be informed of any Change in Control that triggers the Limited Right.
12. . In the event that your principal Employer is a Subsidiary or Joint Venture of Beam that ceases to be a Subsidiary or Joint Venture of Beam and Beam either directly or through an indirect ownership interest no longer maintains any ownership interest in your Employer (a "Divestiture"), any unvested Options, if they are not then immediately exercisable in full and provided they have not expired, shall become immediately exercisable in full as of the Divestiture Date (as defined in the Plan) and shall remain exercisable until the Expiration Date.
Divestiture
13. . Neither you nor any other person shall have any rights of a stockholder as to shares under the Award until, after proper exercise of the Options, such shares shall have been recorded on Beam's official stockholder records as having been issued or transferred.
Stockholder Rights
14. . Subject to these Terms and Conditions, the Award may be exercised either electronically through the on-line process administered by the Stock Plans Administrator or by telephone via a Stock Plans Administrator customer service representative or an automated telephone system. When providing notice of exercise, you must indicate the number of Options being exercised. If notice of exercise is not given to the Stock Plans Administrator (or other person or entity designated by Beam), by the applicable expiration date specified in paragraphs 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11 and 12 above, the notice will be deemed null and void and of no effect. If notice of exercise of an Option is given by a person other than you, Beam may require as a condition to exercising the Option that appropriate proof of the right of such person to exercise the Option be submitted to Beam. Any shares purchased upon exercise will be issued and or delivered as soon as practicable.
Notice of Exercise
15. . In the event a Limited Right referred to in paragraph 11 above becomes exercisable, it shall be exercised in whole or in part by giving notice of such exercise, in the manner described in paragraph 14, to the Stock Plans Administrator (or other person or entity designated by Beam). No notice is required if the Limited Right is automatically exercised as provided in Section 12(b) of the Plan. The exercise will be effective as of the date of exercise, but not earlier than the date notice is actually provided
Exercise of Limited Right
 
to the Stock Plans Administrator in the manner described in paragraph 14 above. The notice must be actually received by the Stock Plans Administrator by no later than the close of business on the last day of the applicable Limited Right Exercise Period, as defined in the Plan (or the date the related Option expires, whichever is earlier).
16. . Except for a "cashless exercise" described below, payment in full of the option price must be received by the Stock Plans Administrator by the date of exercise. You may pay the option price: (i) in cash, (ii) by attestation (i.e., a declaration of share ownership by which you surrender the right to shares you own), or (iii) by a combination of cash and such shares that have been held by you for a period of at least one year and that have a total market value which, together with such cash, equals the option price. The "market value" of shares or per share of Beam Common Stock as of any date means the value determined by reference to the closing price of a share of Beam Common Stock as finally reported on the New York Stock Exchange for the trading day next preceding such date. You may also pay the option price from the proceeds of the sale of shares covered by the Award, called a cashless exercise, to the extent permitted under the cashless exercise process approved by the Committee.
Payment of Option Price
17. . Upon exercise of any portion of your Award (or at such later time as taxable income from the exercise is deemed to be realized), Federal income tax withholding (and state and local income tax withholding, if applicable) may be required by your Employer in respect of taxes on income realized by you. Your Employer may withhold such required amounts from your future paychecks or may require that you deliver the amounts to be withheld. In addition, you may pay the minimum required Federal income tax withholding (and state and local income tax withholding, if applicable) by electing either to have your Employer withhold a portion of the shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon exercise of the Award, or to deliver to your Employer other shares of Common Stock owned by you, in either case having a fair market value (as described in paragraph 16 above, on the date that the amount of tax is to be determined) of the minimum amount to be withheld, provided that the election shall be irrevocable and shall be subject to such rules as the Committee may adopt. You may also arrange to have such tax (or taxes) paid directly to your Employer on your behalf from the proceeds of the sale of common stock to the extent provided in the notice of exercise referred to in paragraph 11.
Tax Withholding
18. . In the event of a conflict between these Terms and Conditions of the Award and the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall apply.
Conflicts
 

Exhibit 99.1
The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information of Beam Inc. (formerly Fortune Brands, Inc., the "Company") gives effect to the spin-off (the "Spin-Off") of Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. ("Home & Security" or "H&S"), which occurred on October 3, 2011. To effectuate the Spin-Off, the Company paid a pro rata dividend of one share of Home & Security common stock for each outstanding share of the Company's common stock as of September 20, 2011. Home & Security paid a cash dividend to the Company in the amount of $500 million immediately prior to the Spin-Off. As a result of the Spin-Off, Home & Security became an independent publicly traded company trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "FBHS". Effective with the Spin-Off, Home & Security is accounted for as a discontinued operation in the Company's financial statements in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 205, "Presentation of Financial Statements" (ASC 205).
The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information of the Company also gives effect to the Company's sale of the Acushnet Company golf business segment ("Golf"). On July 29, 2011, the Company completed the sale of Golf to a company formed by Fila Korea Ltd. and Mirae Asset Private Equity of Korea for a cash purchase price of $1.225 billion (subject to certain post-closing adjustments). The Company estimates that it will realize net proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion after taxes and expenses. Effective May 20, 2011, Golf is accounted for as a discontinued operation in the Company's financial statements in accordance with ASC 205. The Spin-Off and the sale of Golf are together referred to herein as the "Transactions."
The historical financial information of the Company set forth below has been derived from the historical audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 (the "Annual Report") and the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the six months ended June 30, 2011 (the "Quarterly Report"). The unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of income were prepared as if the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2008. The impacts of the use of net proceeds from the sale of Golf and a dividend from Home & Security to repurchase debt securities are included in the unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of income for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and the year ended December 31, 2010. The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2011 is prepared as if the Transactions occurred on that date. Pro forma income statements for the three most recently completed fiscal years are presented because the treatment of the Golf and Home & Security businesses have not yet been reflected as discontinued operations in the Company's historical information, except as noted above.
The pro forma adjustments are based on available information and certain assumptions that management believes are reasonable as of the date of this filing. However, actual adjustments may differ materially from the information presented. The adjustments are directly attributable to the Transactions and are expected to have a continuing impact on the financial position and results of operations of the Company. The statements of income do not reflect any adjustments for non-recurring items. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to present fairly the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information have been made.
 
The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information, including notes thereto, should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements of the Company included in its Annual Report and its Quarterly Report. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements presented do not purport to represent what the Company's results of operations or financial position would actually have been had the transaction occurred on the dates presented, nor is it intended to be indicative of the Company's future results of operations or financial position.
