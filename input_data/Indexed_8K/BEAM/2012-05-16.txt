On May 10, 2012, Beam Inc. (the "Company") and Barclays Capital Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, acting for themselves and as representatives of the other underwriters, entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") in connection with the offer and sale of $300 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 1.875% Notes due 2017 (the "2017 Notes") and $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.250% Notes due 2022 (the "2022 Notes" and, together with the 2017 Notes, the "Notes") in an underwritten public offering (the "Offering"). The issuance and sale of the Notes is expected to close on May 21, 2012. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering to finance its acquisition of the Pinnacle vodka and Calico Jack rum brands and certain other related assets of White Rock Distilleries, Inc. (the "Acquisition").
The Underwriting Agreement contains representations, warranties and agreements of the Company, conditions to closing, indemnification and contribution rights and obligations of the parties, termination provisions and other terms and conditions in each case that are customary in agreements of this type. The Notes are being offered and sold by the Company pursuant to its automatic shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3ASR (Registration Statement No. 333-181026), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 27, 2012, as supplemented by the final prospectus supplement dated May 10, 2012 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 11, 2012.
The Notes will be issued pursuant to the Indenture dated as of April 15, 1999 (the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly The Chase Manhattan Bank), as trustee. The Indenture contains covenants that require the Company to satisfy certain conditions in order to incur debt secured by liens, engage in sale/leaseback transactions or merge or consolidate with another entity. The Indenture also provides for customary events of default and other customary provisions.
The 2017 Notes will mature on May 15, 2017 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 1.875% per annum. The 2022 Notes will mature on May 15, 2022 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.250% per annum. The Company will pay interest on the Notes from May 21, 2012 semi-annually, in arrears, on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning November 15, 2012. The Notes will constitute unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company and will rank on parity with all of the Company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding.
At its option, the Company may redeem each series of Notes, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes of such series then outstanding to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of the Notes of such series to be redeemed (excluding interest accrued as of the redemption date), discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis at the applicable Treasury Rate (as defined in the Notes) plus 20 basis points, in the case of the 2017 Notes, and 25 basis points, in the case of the 2022 Notes.
 
At its option, at any time on and after February 15, 2022 (90 days prior to the maturity date of the 2022 Notes), the Company may redeem the 2022 Notes, in whole or in part, at 100% of the aggregate principal amount of 2022 Notes to be redeemed.
In the event that (i) the Company does not consummate the Acquisition on or before October 31, 2012, or (ii) the purchase agreement with respect to the Acquisition is terminated at any time before October 31, 2012, the Company may redeem either or both series of the Notes at its option, in whole but not in part, at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the acquisition redemption date.
If a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the Notes) occurs, the Company will be required to make an offer on the terms set forth in the Notes to each holder of the Notes to repurchase all or any part of that holder's Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
From time to time in the ordinary course of their respective businesses, certain of the underwriters, the indenture trustee and their affiliates have engaged in and may in the future engage in commercial banking, investment management, investment banking, derivatives and/or financial advisory and other commercial transactions and services with the Company and its affiliates for which they have received or will receive fees and commissions. Certain of the underwriters or their affiliates hold indebtedness that may, if the Acquisition is not consummated for any reason, be repaid with proceeds from the sale of the Notes as described in the prospectus supplement referred to above.
 
The information set forth under "Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement" of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference.

May 10, 2012
From time to time, BEAM INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), may enter into one or more underwriting agreements that provide for the sale of designated securities to the several underwriters named therein. The standard provisions set forth herein may be incorporated by reference in any such underwriting agreement (an "Underwriting Agreement"). The Underwriting Agreement, including the provisions incorporated therein by reference, is herein referred to as this Agreement. Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Underwriting Agreement are used herein as therein defined.
The Company proposes to issue and sell from time to time certain of (a) its debt securities (the "Debt Securities") to be issued pursuant to the provisions of an Indenture dated as of April 15, 1999, as supplemented (the "Indenture"), between the Company (formerly Fortune Brands, Inc.) and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A.) as Trustee (the "Trustee") and (b) its Warrants (the "Debt Warrants") to purchase Debt Securities (such Debt Securities to be purchasable through the exercise of Debt Warrants being referred to herein as the "Debt Warrant Securities") to be evidenced by warrant certificates (the "Warrant Certificates") and to be issued pursuant to the provisions of the Debt Warrant Agreement identified in the Underwriting Agreement. The Debt Securities may be convertible into Common Stock, par value $3.125 per share, of the Company ("Common Stock") as provided in or pursuant to the Indenture, and Preferred Share Purchase Rights (the "Rights") may be delivered with Common Stock upon conversion of any convertible Debt Securities. The Debt Securities and Debt Warrants to be sold pursuant to this Agreement, but not the Debt Warrant Securities or the Common Stock or Rights, if any, issuable or deliverable upon conversion of any convertible Debt Securities, are collectively referred to herein as the "Offered Securities". The Debt Securities and Debt Warrants will have or be of varying designations, maturities, rates and times of payment of interest, selling prices, exercise prices, conversion prices, expiration dates, redemption terms, currencies and other terms.
The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") registration statements relating to the Debt Securities and Debt Warrants and the shares of Common Stock and Rights, if any, issuable or deliverable upon conversion of any convertible Debt Securities, has filed such amendments thereto as may have been required to the date of the Underwriting Agreement and has filed with, or mailed for filing to, or shall promptly hereafter file with or mail for filing to, the Commission a prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Offered Securities and the Debt Warrant Securities, if any, pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The term "Registration Statement" means such registration
 
statements as amended to the date of the Underwriting Agreement and any additional information contained in a form of prospectus or prospectus supplement that is deemed retroactively to be a part of the Registration Statement pursuant to Rules 430A, 430B or 430C. The term "Basic Prospectus" means the prospectus included in the Registration Statement relating to the Debt Securities and the Debt Warrants, as updated from time to time. The term "Prospectus" means the Basic Prospectus together with the prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Offered Securities and the Debt Warrant Securities, if any, as filed with, or mailed for filing to, or as shall promptly hereafter be filed with or mailed for filing to, the Commission pursuant to Rule 424. The term "preliminary prospectus" means a preliminary prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Offered Securities and the Debt Warrant Securities, if any, together with the Basic Prospectus. As used herein, the terms "Registration Statement", "Basic Prospectus", "Prospectus" and "preliminary prospectus" shall include in each case the material, if any, incorporated by reference therein.
In addition, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them below for purposes of this Agreement:
"Contract Securities" means the Offered Securities, if any, to be purchased pursuant to the delayed delivery contracts referred to below.
"General Use Free Writing Prospectus" means any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that is intended for general distribution to prospective investors, as evidenced by its being specified in Schedule A to the Underwriting Agreement.
"Issuer Free Writing Prospectus" means any "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, relating to the Offered Securities in the form filed or required to be filed with the Commission by the Company or, if not required to be filed, in the form retained in the Company's records pursuant to Rule 433(g).
"Limited Use Free Writing Prospectus" means any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that is not a General Use Free Writing Prospectus.
"Rules" means the rules promulgated under the Securities Act.
"Statutory Prospectus" means the prospectus relating to the Offered Securities that is included in the Registration Statement in the form first used (or made available upon request of purchasers pursuant to Rule 173) in connection with confirmation of sales of the Offered Securities, including any document incorporated by reference therein and
 
any prospectus or prospectus supplement deemed to be a part thereof that has not been superseded or modified. For purposes of this definition, information contained in a form of prospectus (including a prospectus supplement) that is deemed retroactively to be a part of the Registration Statement pursuant to Rules 430A, 430B or 430C shall be considered to be included in the Statutory Prospectus only as of the actual time that form of prospectus (including a prospectus supplement) is filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b).
"Time of Sale" means the time when sales of the Offered Securities are first made.
"Time of Sale Information" means the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement dated the Trade Date identified in the Underwriting Agreement, together with the Basic Prospectus and each General Use Free Writing Prospectus issued at or prior to the Time of Sale.
"Underwriters' Securities" means the Offered Securities to be purchased by the Underwriters herein.
If the Prospectus provides for sales of Offered Securities pursuant to delayed delivery contracts, the Company hereby authorizes the Underwriters to solicit offers to purchase Contract Securities on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Prospectus pursuant to delayed delivery contracts substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto ("Delayed Delivery Contracts") but with such changes therein as the Company may authorize or approve. Delayed Delivery Contracts are to be with institutional investors approved by the Company and of the types set forth in the Prospectus. On the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), the Company will pay the Manager as compensation, for the accounts of the Underwriters, the fee set forth in the Underwriting Agreement in respect of the principal amount and number of Contract Securities. The Underwriters will not have any responsibility in respect of the validity or the performance of Delayed Delivery Contracts.
If the Company executes and delivers Delayed Delivery Contracts with institutional investors, the principal amount and number of Contract Securities shall be deducted from the principal amount and number of Offered Securities to be purchased by the several Underwriters and the aggregate principal amount or number of Offered Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter shall be reduced pro rata in proportion to the principal amount or number, as the case may be, of Offered Securities set forth opposite each Underwriter's name in the Underwriting Agreement, except to the extent that the Manager determines that such reduction shall be otherwise and so advises the Company.
 
The Company is advised by the Manager that the Underwriters propose to make a public offering of their respective portions of the Underwriters' Securities as soon after this Agreement is entered into as in the Manager's judgment is advisable. The terms of the public offering of the Underwriters' Securities are set forth in the Prospectus.
Payment for the Underwriters' Securities shall be made by wire transfer to an account designated by the Company in immediately available funds at the time, on the date and at the place set forth in the Underwriting Agreement, upon delivery to the Manager for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters of the Underwriters' Securities (other than Debt Securities in registered global form) registered in such names and in such denominations as the Manager shall request in writing not less than two full business days prior to the date of delivery and, in the case of Underwriters' Securities that are Debt Securities in registered global form, upon delivery to the Depositary identified in the Underwriting Agreement of one or more global Debt Security certificates, registered in the name of the Depositary or a nominee thereof, for credit to the respective accounts of the Depositary participants. The time and date of such payment and delivery with respect to the Underwriters' Securities are herein referred to as the Closing Date.
The several obligations of the Underwriters hereunder are subject to the following conditions:
 
 
 
 
 
In further consideration of the agreements of the Underwriters contained in this Agreement, the Company covenants as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In relation to each Member State of the European Economic Area which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a "Relevant Member State"), each Underwriter hereby represents and agrees that with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member State (the "Relevant Implementation Date") it has not made and will not make an offer of the Offered Securities to the public in that Relevant Member State prior to the publication of a prospectus in relation to the Offered Securities which has been approved by the competent authority in that Relevant Member State, or where appropriate, approved in another Relevant Member State and notified to the competent authority in that Relevant Member State, all in accordance with the Prospectus Directive, except that it may, with effect from and including the Relevant Implementation Date, make an offer of Offered Securities to the public in that Relevant Member State at any time:
 
 
 
 
In particular, each Underwriter hereby represents and agrees that:
 
 
 
For purposes of this Article VII, an "offer of Offered Securities to the public" means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Offered Securities to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Offered Securities, as the same may be varied in that Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive. The expression "Prospectus Directive" means Directive 2003/71/EC and includes any relevant implementing measure in each Relevant Member State. References to "" are to euros.
The Company represents and warrants to each Underwriter that:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Company represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Manager, and each Underwriter represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Company and the Manager, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Offered Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 405, required to be filed with the Commission. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Company hereby consents to the provision by the Underwriters of a Term Sheet, the form of which is set forth in Schedule B to the Underwriting Agreement.
The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, any Statutory Prospectus, the Prospectus (if used within the period set forth in paragraph (c) of Article VI hereof and as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), the Time of Sale Information or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished in writing to the Company by any Underwriter expressly for use therein.
Each Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and any person controlling the Company to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished in writing by such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, any Statutory Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
 
In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and the representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to local counsel) for all such indemnified parties, and that all such fees shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Manager in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the second preceding paragraph and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the first preceding paragraph. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
If the indemnification provided for in this Article IX is unavailable to an indemnified party under the second or third paragraphs hereof or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities and (ii) the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable
 
considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Offered Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in respect thereof. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Article IX were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article IX, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities underwritten and distributed to the public by such Underwriter were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Article IX are several, in proportion to the respective principal amount or number, as the case may be, of Offered Securities purchased by each of such Underwriters, and not joint.
The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Article IX and the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by any Underwriter or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its directors or officers or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Offered Securities.
 
This Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Manager, by notice to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) trading of any securities issued by the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities; (iv) a material disruption of the settlement or clearance of debt securities in the United States shall occur and continue until at least the business day preceding the Closing Date or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in the reasonable judgment of the Manager, is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Offered Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and the Prospectus.
If any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Underwriters' Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, and the aggregate amount of Underwriters' Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of the Underwriters' Securities, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions which the amounts of Underwriters' Securities set forth opposite their names in the Underwriting Agreement bear to the aggregate amount of Underwriters' Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Manager may specify, to purchase the Underwriters' Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase; that in no event shall the amount of Underwriters' Securities which any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement be increased pursuant to this Article XI by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such amount of Underwriters' Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Underwriters' Securities and the aggregate amount of Underwriters' Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of the Underwriters' Securities and arrangements satisfactory to the Manager and the Company for the purchase of such Underwriters' Securities, are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement, or the provisions hereof applicable to the sale and purchase of the Underwriters' Securities, will terminate without liability on the
provided
 
part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or of the Company. In any such case either the Manager or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under the Underwriting Agreement.
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement, with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with the Offered Securities.
The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Offered Securities (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, no Underwriter is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.
This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York.
 
Not Applicable.
