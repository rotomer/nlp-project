SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - ------------------------ 1. Nothing in this section shall be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell a security to any person in any jurisdiction where such offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. For more information on any U.S. Franklin Templeton fund, investors should request a prospectus containing more complete information, including sales charges, expenses and risks, from securities dealers or by calling Franklin Templeton Distributors, Inc. at 1-800/DIAL BEN(R) (1-800/342-5236).

PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS. MORNINGSTAR ratings are based on Class A shares. LIPPER rankings are based on Class A shares, with the exception of those for Mutual Series, which are based on Class Z shares, which are offered to qualified investors only and have no sales charges nor Rule 12b-1 fees. All asset data is based on 05/31/02 figures. Indices are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in them. Unless otherwise noted, fund returns quoted reflect Class A shares. Performance returns, ratings and rankings for other classes may vary. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions and an investor may experience a gain or loss when they sell their shares. 3. LIPPER calculates averages by taking all the funds in a peer group and averaging their total returns for the periods indicated. LIPPER tracks 128 peer groups of long-term U.S. retail mutual funds, and the groups vary in size from 6 to 885. LIPPER total return calculations include reinvested dividends and capital gains, but do not include sales charges or expense subsidization by the manager. Results may have been different if these or other factors had been considered. 4. Source: LIPPER(R) INC., 6/30/02. Of the eligible Franklin Templeton non-money market funds tracked by LIPPER, 35, 40, 34 and 19 funds ranked in the top quartile and 24, 25, 22 and 19 funds ranked in the second quartile, for the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods, respectively, for their respective LIPPER peer groups. 5. Source: LIPPER(R) INC., 6/30/02. Franklin Templeton funds received 87 LIPPER LEADER designations for Preservation and 47 LIPPER LEADER designations for Consistent Return. LIPPER LEADER for Consistent Return ratings reflect the degree of a fund's historical success in achieving superior risk-adjusted returns, adjusted for volatility, relative to peers. LIPPER LEADER for Preservation ratings reflect the degree of a fund's historical success in avoiding periods of losses relative to other funds within the same asset class. Preservation ratings are relative, rather than absolute, measures, and funds named LIPPER LEADERS for Preservation may still experience losses periodically; those losses may by larger for equity and mixed equity funds than for fixed-income funds. Twenty percent of funds analyzed in each category are named LIPPER LEADERS. LIPPER LEADERS MEASURE PAST FUND PERFORMANCE, AND PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS. LIPPER LEADER STATUS DOES NOT NECESSARILY IMPLY THAT A FUND HAD THE BEST PERFORMANCE WITHIN ITS CATEGORY. LIPPER LEADER STATUS IS BASED ON RETURNS FOR A 3-YEAR PERIOD AND IS CALCULATED MONTHLY USING DATA AVAILABLE AT THE TIME OF THE CALCULATION; LIPPER UNDERTAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR UPDATING THE CALCULATIONS MORE FREQUENTLY THAN MONTHLY TO INCORPORATE MORE CURRENT DATA. 6. Source: LIPPER(R) INC., 6/30/02. 10 out of 11 eligible Templeton equity funds ranked in the top two LIPPER quartiles for the one-year period, 9 of 11 for the three-year period, 5 of 11 for the five-year period and 6 of 8 for the 10-year period for their respective LIPPER peer groups. Templeton Growth Fund Class A ranked 16 in a universe of 317 funds in LIPPER's "Global Funds" group for the one-year period, 18 of 211 for the three-year period, 19 of 136 for the five-year period and 5 of 27 for the 10-year period.

7. Source: MORNINGSTAR (C) 6/30/02. For each fund with at least a three-year history, MORNINGSTAR calculates a Morningstar Rating(TM) based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. 8.
