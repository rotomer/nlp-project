ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR-END RESULTS SAN MATEO, CA, OCTOBER 24, 2002 - Franklin Resources, Inc. (Franklin Templeton Investments) (NYSE: BEN) today reported net income of $68.5 million, or $0.26 per share diluted (after a pre-tax, non-cash, non-operating charge of $60.1 million relating to an unrealized loss in the company's corporate investments, or $0.17 per share diluted after tax) on revenues of $608.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2002. As announced on October 17, the results prior to recording this charge were in line with analyst expectations for the fourth fiscal quarter. Net income was $125.7 million, or $0.48 per share diluted, on revenues of $666.1 million in the preceding quarter. In the comparable quarter a year ago, net income was $83.9 million, or $0.32 per share diluted, on revenues of $603.9 million. Operating income decreased 9% this quarter over the prior quarter and increased 50% over the same quarter in the prior year. Net income for the year ended September 30, 2002 was $432.7 million, or $1.65 per share diluted, on revenues of $2,518.5 million as compared to net income of $484.7 million, or $1.91 per share diluted, on revenues of $2,354.8 million a year ago. Operating income increased 14% as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a 7% increase in revenue resulting from higher average assets under management, partially offset by a 5% increase in operating expenses. As of September 30, 2002, assets under management by the company's subsidiaries were $247.8 billion, as compared to $270.4 billion last quarter and $246.4 billion at this time last year. Simple monthly average assets under management during the current quarter were $259.0 billion compared to $274.8 billion in the preceding quarter and $261.3 billion in the same quarter a year ago. Equity assets now comprise 48% of total assets under management as compared to 53% last quarter and 51% at September 30, 2001. Fixed-income assets now comprise 35% of total assets under management, as compared to 31% last quarter and 32% at the same time last year. As of September 30, 2002 hybrid assets account for 15% of total assets under management, and remained unchanged from last quarter and the comparable quarter a year ago. Sales and reinvested dividends exceeded redemptions ("net inflows") for the eighth consecutive quarter. Complex-wide net inflows were $3.1 billion for the current quarter compared to $5.6 billion for the prior quarter and $1.8 billion for the comparable quarter a year ago.

Source: MORNINGSTAR(C)9/30/02. For each fund with at least a three-year history, MORNINGSTAR calculates a MORNINGSTAR Rating(TM)based on a MORNINGSTAR Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each
category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall MORNINGSTAR Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) MORNINGSTAR Rating metrics. PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS. MORNINGSTAR Rating is for the A share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics. The following funds were rated against 188; 128; and 46 mid-cap value funds for the respective 3-, 5- and 10-year periods ended 9/30/02, as applicable.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Statements in this press release regarding Franklin Resources, Inc.'s business which are not historical facts are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause the actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in the "Risk Factors" section in Franklin's recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, the "Risk Factors" section of the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Franklin's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001. * Continuing volatility in the equity markets have caused the levels of our assets under management to fluctuate significantly. * Continued weak market conditions may lower our assets under management and reduce our revenues and income. * We face strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies. * Changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our revenues or hinder our growth. * Previously announced revenue and cost synergies from the acquisition of Fiduciary Trust Company International may not be fully realized and may take longer to realize than originally anticipated. * For the next several years, insurance costs are likely to increase materially and we may not be able to obtain the same types or amounts of coverage. * Our insurance policies may not cover all losses for property damage, extra expenses and business interruptions arising out of the destruction of our offices at the World Trade Center in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. * The ongoing threat of terrorism may adversely affect the general economy, financial and capital markets and our business. # # #
