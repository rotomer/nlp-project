PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS. MORNINGSTAR ratings are based on Class A shares. LIPPER rankings are based on Class A shares, with the exception of those for Mutual Series, which are based on Class Z shares, which are offered to qualified investors only and have no sales charges nor Rule 12b-1 fees. All asset data is based on 11/30/02 figures unless noted otherwise. Indices are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in them. Unless otherwise noted, fund returns quoted reflect Class A shares. Performance returns, ratings and rankings for other classes may vary. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions and an investor may experience a gain or loss when they sell their shares. 3. LIPPER calculates averages by taking all the funds in a peer group and averaging their total returns for the periods indicated. LIPPER tracks 129 peer groups of long-term U.S. retail mutual funds, and the groups vary in size from 6 to 1002. LIPPER total return calculations include reinvested dividends and capital gains, but do not include sales charges or expense subsidization by the manager. Results may have been different if these or other factors had been considered. 4. Source: Lipper(R)Inc., 12/31/02.

For each fund with at least a three-year history, MORNINGSTAR calculates a MORNINGSTAR Rating based on a MORNINGSTAR Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall MORNINGSTAR Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and 10-year (if applicable) MORNINGSTAR Rating metrics. PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS. MORNINGSTAR Rating is for the A share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics. The following fund was rated against 664; 488; 102 foreign stock funds for the respective 3-, 5- and 10-year periods ended 12/31/02, as applicable.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS - -------------------------- Statements in this press release regarding Franklin Resources, Inc.'s business which are not historical facts are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause the actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in the "Risk Factors" section in Franklin's recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, the "Risk Factors" section of the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Franklin's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002. * Continuing volatility in the equity markets have caused the levels of our assets under management to fluctuate significantly. 9 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Continued weak market conditions may lower our assets under management and reduce our revenues and income. * We face strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies. * Changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our revenues or hinder our growth. * Previously announced revenue and cost synergies from the acquisition of Fiduciary Trust Company International may not be fully realized and may take longer to realize than originally anticipated. * For the next several years, insurance costs are likely to increase materially and we may not be able to obtain the same types or amounts of coverage. * Our insurance policies may not cover all losses for property damage, extra expenses and business interruptions arising out of the destruction of our offices at the World Trade Center in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. * The ongoing threat of terrorism may adversely affect the general economy, financial and capital markets and our business. # # # 10 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
