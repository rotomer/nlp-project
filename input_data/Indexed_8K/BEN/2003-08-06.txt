(operating as Franklin Templeton Investments) (NYSE: BEN) of San Mateo, CA, and Darby Overseas Investments, Ltd. of Washington, DC, today announced that they have signed a definitive agreement under which Franklin Resources, Inc. will acquire the remaining portion of Darby Overseas Investments, Ltd. and Darby Overseas Partners, L.P. (collectively "Darby") which it does not already own, for $75.88 million in cash. Franklin Resources, Inc. currently owns 12.66% of Darby, which managed approximately $700 million in private equity and mezzanine funds and managed and sub-advised approximately $300 million in emerging markets fixed-income products as of June 30, 2003. The transaction, which is subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, is expected to be completed no later than October 10, 2003. "We are very pleased to bring Darby Overseas Investments on board to expand our investment offerings in the alternative strategies arena and further meet the needs of our institutional and Fiduciary individual clients," said Charles B. Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer of Franklin Resources, Inc., who has served on Darby's Board of Directors since its establishment in 1994. "Darby's strong brand recognition and established track record in emerging markets private equity and mezzanine finance make it an excellent fit and solid strategic investment for our organization." Darby's chairman and founder is Nicholas F. Brady, former secretary of the US Treasury and former chairman and CEO of Dillon, Read & Co. Inc. He is especially well known in emerging markets and international finance as the architect of the "Brady Plan." Darby's chief executive officer is Richard H. Frank, former managing director of the World Bank and former chief financial officer of the International Finance Corporation. Mr. Brady, who since 1993 has served as a director of 17 Franklin Templeton ================================================================================
Investments' funds for US and non-US investors, stated, "Our union with Franklin Templeton Investments will enable us to more effectively channel resources to emerging markets companies with the best growth potential. This is a combination of two outstanding firms that will provide exceptional leadership in emerging markets finance." Darby will continue to retain its distinct identity under the leadership of Mr. Brady and Mr. Frank with its team of experienced emerging markets investment managers, drawn from both the private and public sectors. Their approach is based on a rigorous investment process and active company relationships. The group's experience and strong business relationships come from years of working and living in their respective regions. As one of the initial investors in Darby, Franklin Templeton Investments has also participated in three of Darby's six emerging markets private equity and mezzanine funds. "We have had the opportunity to witness Darby's growth and disciplined approach firsthand," said Charles B. Johnson. "They have become a leading emerging markets private equity firm with a standard of excellence that we are committed to supporting." Darby CEO Richard Frank noted, "Darby will benefit from Franklin Templeton's outstanding reputation and international presence. With this support, we look forward to expansion by launching new private equity and mezzanine funds in emerging markets." Mr. Frank, a director of two Franklin Templeton Investments' funds for non-US investors added, "With their strong distribution capabilities and established presence in markets around the globe, they are uniquely positioned to support our objective of being the industry leader in emerging markets private equity and mezzanine finance." "The contributions of Darby's private equity group will complement Franklin Templeton Investments' broad global investment capabilities," said Mark Mobius, managing director of Templeton Asset Management, Ltd. His group specializes in investing in emerging markets. "By serving on Darby's Advisory Board over the last few years, I have had the opportunity to work with the firm on its investment policies and strategic direction, and believe this team has established itself as a proven leader, most notably in Latin America, with a strong presence in Asia and with plans for Central Europe as well," said Mobius. "Emerging markets private equity requires a highly specialized skill set, and Darby has demonstrated its investment capabilities throughout various stages of the company value creation cycle." Darby sponsors and manages funds for institutional investors and high-net worth individuals that invest in Latin American private equity (including specialized financial services and technology funds). Darby, through funds in Asia and Latin America, is the leading private mezzanine investment firm for emerging markets.
