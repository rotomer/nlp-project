ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR-END RESULTS SAN MATEO, CA, OCTOBER 23, 2003 - Franklin Resources, Inc. (Franklin Templeton Investments) (NYSE: BEN) today reported net income of $152.1 million, or $0.61 per share diluted on revenues of $722.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2003. Net income was $131.4 million, or $0.52 per share diluted, on revenues of $683.9 million in the preceding quarter. In the comparable quarter a year ago, net income was $68.5 million, or $0.26 per share diluted (after a pre-tax, non-cash, non-operating charge of $60.1 million relating to an unrealized loss in the company's corporate investments, or $0.17 per share diluted after tax), on revenues of $608.3 million. Operating income increased 18% this quarter over the prior quarter and increased 42% over the same quarter in the prior year. Net income for the year ended September 30, 2003, was $502.8 million, or $1.97 per share diluted, on revenues of $2,624.4 million as compared to net income of $432.7 million, or $1.65 per share diluted, on revenues of $2,518.5 million a year ago. Operating income increased 11% as compared to the prior year primarily due to a 4% increase in revenue resulting from a 3% increase in simple monthly average assets under management, partially offset by a 2% increase in operating expenses. As of September 30, 2003, assets under management by the company's subsidiaries were $301.9 billion, as compared to $287.0 billion last quarter and $247.8 billion at this time last year. Simple monthly average assets under management during the current quarter were $294.0 billion compared to $272.2 billion in the preceding quarter and $259.0 billion in the same quarter a year ago. Equity assets now comprise 51% of total assets under management as compared to 50% last quarter and 48% at September 30, 2002. Fixed-income assets now comprise 32% of total assets under management, as compared to 33% last quarter and 35% at the same time last year. As of September 30, 2003, hybrid/balanced assets accounted for 15% of total assets under management, and remained unchanged from last quarter and the comparable quarter a year ago. Sales exceeded redemptions by $4.4 billion for the current quarter compared to $6.0 billion for the prior quarter and $2.5 billion for the comparable quarter a year ago.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS - ------------------------ FIN 46 In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46"). Under FIN 46, a variable interest entity ("VIE") is defined as a corporation, trust, partnership or other entity where the equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance the activities of the VIE or the equity investment holders do not have defined rights and obligations normally associated with an equity investment. FIN 46 requires consolidation of a VIE by the enterprise that has the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership, referred to as the primary beneficiary. The consolidation and disclosure provisions of FIN 46 are effective immediately for VIEs created after January 31, 2003, and, originally, for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2003 for VIEs created before February 1, 2003. However, in October 2003, the FASB issued Staff Position FIN 46-6 deferring the consolidation provisions of FIN 46 to interim or annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2003 for VIEs created before February 1, 2003. The following tables present the effect of the adoption of FIN 46 on the consolidated results of operations and financial position of Franklin Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") for VIEs created after January 31, 2003. These tables present the effect of consolidating VIEs for which the Company is the primary beneficiary and are intended to provide transparency as to the impact of the consolidation. The Company is continuing its evaluation of sponsored investment products and will adopt the consolidation provision of FIN 46 for entities created before February 1, 2003 in the quarter ending December 31, 2003 in accordance with Staff Position FIN 46-6. Six VIEs, all sponsored investment products with inception dates after January 31, 2003, have been consolidated in the Company's financial statements at September 30, 2003. As shown in Table I and II, the Company's operating revenues include net operating revenues of $93 thousand related to the results of operations of these VIEs from inception. In addition, an aggregate of $174 thousand of investment management fees, underwriting and distribution fees, and shareholder servicing fees related to these products have been eliminated on consolidation. Other income includes net realized and unrealized gains of the sponsored investment products of $1,645 thousand and $43 thousand of minority interest representing the portion of these sponsored investment products' income that the Company does not own. The net result of these entries required under FIN 46 increased net income by $1,141 thousand for the quarter and year ended September 30, 2003. Prior to the adoption of FIN 46, these sponsored investment products would have been classified as investment securities, available-for-sale, in the consolidated balance sheet, and Company's portion of the sponsored investment products' net change in value of $1,141 thousand would have been credited to other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet, until realized. As shown in Table III, the impact of consolidating these VIEs on the Company's balance sheet was to increase current assets by $10,358 thousand, current liabilities by $2,068 thousand and minority interest by $8,290 thousand. The net impact of $10,358 thousand includes an increase in current assets of $48,965 thousand representing the assets of the sponsored investment products, partially offset by a decrease of $38,607 thousand, representing the Company's carrying value of these investments prior to the adoption of FIN 46. In addition to our sponsored investment products, we expect to consolidate our headquarters campus under the requirements of FIN 46 in the period ending December 31, 2003. The Company qualifies as the primary beneficiary of the lessor trust, a special purpose entity that financed the construction of the campus. The Company estimates the impact on the consolidated balance sheet at October 1, 2003 will be to increase property and equipment, net, by approximately $159.0 million, and debt by approximately $164.9 million. The debt matures on September 30, 2004, and will be shown in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as a current liability until it is refinanced or paid. During the quarter ended September 30, 2003, under the current operating lease treatment, the Company has recognized and remitted to the special purpose entity rental payments of approximately $0.7 million included in information systems, technology and occupancy expense. As rental payments due under the lease agreement are equal to the interest charges incurred by the special purpose entity on the loan, after adopting FIN 46, rent expense will decline and interest expense will increase by the same amount. In addition, the Company will recognize a quarterly depreciation charge related to the campus of approximately $1.4 million in information systems, technology and occupancy expense. 6 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SFAS 150 In May 2003, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity" ("SFAS 150"), was issued. SFAS 150 clarifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and requires that these instruments be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position. As disclosed previously, the Company sells put options giving the purchaser the right to sell shares of its common stock to the Company at a specified price on the designated expiration dates. Prior to fiscal fourth quarter 2003, these put options were treated as equity instruments and the related premium received was recorded in stockholders' equity as capital in excess of par value. Under SFAS 150, effective July 1, 2003, these put options are presented as liabilities and measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized in investment and other income in the Company's consolidated income statements. The increase in fair value of these instruments during the quarter ended September 30, 2003 contributed approximately $5.0 million to non-operating income. At September 30, 2003, there were 1.9 million put options outstanding with various expiration dates from December 2003 through January 2004 and exercise prices ranging from $33 to $35. 7 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
