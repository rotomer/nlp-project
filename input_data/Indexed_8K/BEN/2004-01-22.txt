NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS - ------------------------ FIN 46 In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46"). Under FIN 46, a variable interest entity ("VIE") is defined as a corporation, trust, partnership or other entity where the equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance the activities of the VIE or the equity investment holders do not have defined rights and obligations normally associated with an equity investment. FIN 46 requires consolidation of a VIE by the enterprise that has the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership, referred to as the primary beneficiary. The consolidation and disclosure provisions of FIN 46 are effective immediately for VIEs created after January 31, 2003. Effective July 1, 2003, six of our sponsored investment products created after January 31, 2003, were consolidated in our financial statements. In December 2003, the FASB published FASB Interpretation No. 46, CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (REVISED DECEMBER 2003) (FIN46-R), clarifying FIN 46 and exempting certain entities from the provisions of FIN 46. Generally, application of FIN 46-R is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in structures commonly referred to as special-purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003, and, for other types of VIEs, for periods ending after March 15, 2004. We early adopted FIN 46-R as of December 31, 2003, and, as a result, we have recognized a cumulative effect of an accounting change, net of tax, as of this date to reflect the accumulated retained earnings of VIEs in which we became an interest holder prior to February 1, 2003. The following tables present the effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position of applying FIN 46-R. These tables present the effect of consolidating VIEs for which the Company is the primary beneficiary and are intended to provide transparency. These tables reflect the continuing activity of VIEs with inception dates after January 31, 2003, which were consolidated effective July 1, 2003, and they present the cumulative effect adjustment for sponsored investment products with an inception date prior to February 1, 2003. These products primarily include open-end funds registered in Canada and in other international locations. The cumulative effect adjustment, net of tax related to the sponsored investment products included in Table I is $8.0 million. The impact of consolidating these sponsored investment products on our balance sheet, included in the Table II presentation, is to increase current assets by $44.6 million, current liabilities by $9.7 million and minority interest by $34.9 million. In addition to consolidating certain sponsored investment products, we qualified as the primary beneficiary of a lessor trust, a special purpose entity that financed the construction of our headquarters campus. The cumulative effect adjustment, net of tax, related to this trust is a charge of $3.2 million. The impact of consolidating the lessor trust in our balance sheet at December 31, 2003, is to increase property and equipment, net, by approximately $157.6 million, and debt by approximately $164.9 million. The debt matures on September 30, 2004, and will continue to be shown in our consolidated balance sheet as a current liability until it is refinanced or paid.

PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS. MORNINGSTAR ratings are based on Class A shares. LIPPER rankings are based on Class A shares, with the exception of those for Mutual Series, which are based on Class Z shares, which are offered to qualified investors only and have no sales charges nor Rule 12b-1 fees. All asset data is based on 11/30/03 figures unless noted otherwise. Unless otherwise noted, fund returns quoted reflect Class A shares. Performance returns, ratings and rankings for other classes may vary. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions and an investor may experience a gain or loss when they sell their shares. 3. LIPPER calculates averages by taking all the funds in a peer group and averaging their total returns for the periods indicated. LIPPER tracks 129 peer groups of long-term U.S. retail mutual funds, and the groups vary in size from 4 to 1098. LIPPER total return calculations include reinvested dividends and capital gains, but do not include sales charges or expense subsidization by the manager. Results may have been different if these or other factors had been considered. 4. Source: LIPPER(R) Inc., 12/31/03.

Source: MORNINGSTAR(C) 12/31/03. For each fund with at least a three-year history, MORNINGSTAR calculates a MORNINGSTAR Rating based on a MORNINGSTAR Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom
10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall MORNINGSTAR Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and 10-year (if applicable) MORNINGSTAR Rating metrics. PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS. MORNINGSTAR Rating is for the A share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics. The following fund was rated against 613; 396; 126 Mid-Cap Growth funds for the respective 3-, 5- and 10-year periods ended 12/31/03, as applicable.

Source: LIPPER(R)Inc., 12/31/03. Lipper Leaders Awards are based on Class A shares only. LIPPER scores for Total Return reflect funds' historical total return performance relative to peers. LIPPER scores for Preservation reflect funds' historical loss avoidance relative to other funds within the same asset class. Preservation ratings are relative, rather than absolute, measures, and funds named LIPPER Leaders for Preservation may still experience losses periodically; those losses may be larger for equity and mixed equity funds than for fixed-income funds. The LIPPER ratings are subject to change every month and are based on an equal-weighted average of percentile rankings for the Total Return and Preservation metrics over 3-, 5- and 10-year periods (if applicable). 20% of funds in each peer group are named LIPPER Leaders, the next 20% receive a score of 2, the middle 20% are scored 3, the next 20% are scored 4, and the lowest 20% are scored 5.

The following Mutual Series open-end funds were awarded LIPPER Leader status in Preservation: Mutual Shares, Mutual Beacon, Mutual Qualified, Mutual Discovery, Mutual European and Mutual Financial Services Funds rated among 6,996 Equity funds. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES DOES INFORMATION ABOUT LIPPER LEADERS CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION TO BUY OR SELL FUNDS, NOR DOES IT NECESSARILY IMPLY THAT A FUND NAMED AS A LIPPER LEADER HAD THE BEST PERFORMANCE WITHIN ITS CATEGORY. LIPPER LEADERS RATINGS ARE BASED ON PAST FUND PERFORMANCE, AND PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS. LIPPER LEADERS ARE DETERMINED MONTHLY USING DATA AVAILABLE AT THE TIME OF CALCULATION; LIPPER UNDERTAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR UPDATING THE CALCULATIONS MORE FREQUENTLY THAN MONTHLY TO INCORPORATE MORE CURRENT DATA. 11.
