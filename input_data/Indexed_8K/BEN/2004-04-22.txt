Please read the prospectus carefully before investing. 1. Nothing in this section shall be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell a security to any person in any jurisdiction where such offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Franklin Templeton Distributors, Inc., One Franklin Parkway, San Mateo, CA, is the funds' principal distributor and a wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. 2. MORNINGSTAR ratings and LIPPER rankings for Franklin Templeton funds are based on Class A shares, with the exception of LIPPER rankings for Mutual Series funds, which are based on Class Z shares. Class Z shares are offered to qualified investors only and have no sales charges nor Rule 12b-1 fees. Franklin Templeton funds are compared against a universe of all share classes. All Franklin Templeton Class A (Class Z) asset data is based on 2/29/04 figures unless noted otherwise. Indices are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in them. Unless otherwise noted, fund returns quoted reflect Class A shares. Performance returns, ratings and rankings for other classes may vary. 3. LIPPER calculates averages by taking all the funds and share classes in a peer group and averaging their total returns for the periods indicated. LIPPER tracks 129 peer groups of long-term U.S. retail mutual funds, and the groups vary in size from 4 to 1064. LIPPER total return calculations include reinvested dividends and capital gains, but do not include sales charges or expense subsidization by the manager. Results may have been different if these or other factors had been considered. 4. Source: LIPPER(R) Inc., 3/31/04.

Source: MORNINGSTAR(C)3/31/04. For each fund with at least a three-year history, MORNINGSTAR calculates a MORNINGSTAR Rating based on a MORNINGSTAR Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) THE OVERALL MORNINGSTAR RATING FOR A FUND IS DERIVED FROM A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE OF THE PERFORMANCE FIGURES ASSOCIATED WITH ITS THREE-, FIVE- AND 10-YEAR (IF APPLICABLE) MORNINGSTAR RATING METRICS. PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS. MORNINGSTAR Rating is for the A share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics. The following fund was rated against 199; 146; 40 Conservative Allocation funds for the respective 3-, 5- and 10-year periods ended 3/31/04, as applicable. For the 3-, 5- and 10-year periods ended 3/31/04, the MORNINGSTAR ratings were: Franklin Income Fund 5, 5, 4. The following funds were rated against 283; 215; 62 World Stock funds for the respective 3-, 5- and 10-year periods ended 3/31/04, as applicable. For the 3-, 5- and 10-year periods ended 3/31/04, the MORNINGSTAR ratings were: Templeton Growth Fund 4, 4, 4 and Templeton World Fund 4, 4, 4. 9. Source: LIPPER(R) Inc., 3/31/04. A LIPPER LEADERS DISTINCTION DOES NOT IMPLY THAT A FUND NAMED AS A LIPPER LEADER HAD THE BEST PERFORMANCE IN ITS CATEGORY. Lipper Leaders Awards are based on Class A shares. LIPPER ratings for Consistent Return reflect funds' historical risk-adjusted returns, adjusted for volatility, relative to peers. LIPPER ratings for Total Return reflect funds' historical total return performance relative to peers. LIPPER ratings for Preservation reflect funds' historical loss avoidance relative to other funds within the same asset class. Preservation ratings are relative, rather than absolute, measures, and funds named Lipper Leaders for Preservation may still experience losses periodically; those losses may be larger for equity and mixed equity funds than for fixed income funds. THE LIPPER RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE EVERY MONTH AND ARE BASED ON AN EQUAL-WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF PERCENTILE RANKS FOR THE CONSISTENT RETURN, TOTAL RETURN AND PRESERVATION METRICS OVER THREE-, FIVE-, AND 10-YEAR PERIODS (IF APPLICABLE). 20% of funds in each peer group are named Lipper Leaders, the next 20% receive a score of 2, the middle 20% are scored 3, the next 20% are scored 4, and the lowest 20% are scored 5.
