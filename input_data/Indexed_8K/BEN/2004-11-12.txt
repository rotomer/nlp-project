ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS - ----------------------- On November 8, 2004, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") approved restricted stock awards ("RSA") granting common stock ("Stock") of the Company under the Company's 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (the "2002 USIP") to certain of the Company's executive officers. Each of the following executive officers of the Company received the following number of shares of Stock: Anne M. Tatlock, Vice Chairman: 6,272 shares; Murray L. Simpson, Executive Vice President and General Counsel: 3,920 shares; James R. Baio, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: 3,607 shares; Jennifer J.

Lusk, Vice President: 2,352 shares. The Company has entered into a Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the "RSA Agreement") with each of the executive officers listed above. Each RSA awarded to such executive officers of the Company has an effective grant date of November 8, 2004, and is subject to annual vesting in equal installments over a three-year period and will vest one-third on September 30, 2005, one-third on September 29, 2006 and one-third on September 28, 2007, subject to accelerated vesting or forfeiture under certain events described in the RSA Agreement. A copy of the 2002 USIP was filed as Exhibit 10.68 to the Company's Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2002. A copy of the form of the RSA Agreement and Notice of Restricted Stock Award ("Notice of Award") under the 2002 USIP is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.74. Each of the foregoing is incorporated herein by reference. The following is a summary of the principal terms of the RSA Agreement and Notice of Award, which are qualified in their entirety by reference to Exhibit 10.74: RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD. The Company issues to participants, including the executive officers (the "Participant") shares of Stock as set forth in the Notice of Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Participant as owner as set forth in the RSA Agreement. All shares of Stock issued are deemed to be issued to Participant as fully paid and non assessable shares, and Participant has all rights of a shareholder, including the right to vote, to receive dividends (including stock dividends), to participate in stock splits or other recapitalizations, and to exchange such shares in a merger, consolidation or other reorganization. TRANSFER RESTRICTION. No Stock issued to Participant may be sold, transferred by gift, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise transferred or disposed of by Participant prior to the date on which it becomes vested. Participant is not precluded from exchanging the Stock awarded pursuant to a cash or stock tender offer, merger, reorganization or consolidation. Any securities (including stock dividends and stock splits) received with respect to shares of Stock which are not yet vested are subject to the RSA Agreement in the same manner and become fully vested at the same time as the Stock with respect to which such additional securities were issued.
VESTING. Participant's interest in the Stock awarded becomes vested and nonforfeitable in accordance with the Vesting Schedule in the Notice of Award so long as Participant maintains continuous status as an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary. If Participant ceases to maintain continuous status as an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries for any reason other than death or disability, all shares of Stock to the extent not yet vested on the date Participant ceases to be a full-time employee are forfeited by Participant. If Participant dies or in the event of termination of Participant's continuous status as an employee as a result of disability while a full-time employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, Participant's interest in all shares of Stock awarded become fully vested and nonforfeitable as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board, "disability" means that the Participant ceases to be an employee on account of permanent and total disability as a result of which the Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long term disability policy. STOCK OPTION GRANT - ------------------ On November 8, 2004, the Compensation Committee also approved a stock option grant to purchase 1,506 shares of Stock under the 2002 USIP to Donna S. Ikeda, Vice President, Human Resources - International. Ms. Ikeda is an executive officer of the Company. The Company has entered into a Stock Option Agreement (the "Option Agreement") with Ms. Ikeda. Each option granted to Ms. Ikeda has an effective grant date of November 8, 2004, and is subject to annual vesting in equal installments over a three-year period and will vest one-third on September 30, 2005, one-third on September 29, 2006 and one-third on September 28, 2007, subject to accelerated vesting or forfeiture under certain events described in the Option Agreement. The option may be exercised only until September 30, 2009, the expiration date. The exercise price of the shares is $55.81 per share. A copy of the form of the Stock Option Agreement and Notice of Grant are filed herewith as Exhibit 10.75. Each of the foregoing is incorporated herein by reference. The following is a summary of the principal terms of the Option Agreement and Notice of Stock Option Grant, which are qualified in their entirety by reference to Exhibit 10.75: GRANT OF OPTION. The Company grants to the optionees ("Optionee"), including executive officers, named in a notice of grant (the "Notice of Grant"), an option (the "Option") to purchase a number of shares (the "Shares"), as set forth in the Notice of Grant, at the exercise price per share set forth in the Notice of Grant (the "Exercise Price"), subject to the terms, conditions and definitions 2002 USIP, adopted by the Company. EXERCISE OF OPTION. Right to Exercise. The Option is exercisable during its term in accordance with the exercise schedule set out in the Notice of Grant and the applicable provisions of the 2002 USIP and the Option Agreement. Method of Payment. Payment of the aggregate Exercise Price may be made in cash or Shares, valued at fair market value on the date of exercise. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT. In the event of termination of Optionee's continuous status as an employee, Optionee may, to the extent otherwise so entitled at the date of such termination (the "Termination Date"), exercise the Option for a period of ninety (90) days after the Termination Date (but in no event later than
the expiration date of the Option). To the extent that Optionee was not entitled to exercise the Option at the Termination Date, or if Optionee does not exercise the Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate. DISABILITY OF OPTIONEE. In the event of termination of Optionee's continuous status as an employee as a result of disability, Optionee may, but only within six (6) months from the Termination Date (but in no event later than the expiration date of the Option), exercise the Option in full, even if the right to exercise shall not have otherwise accrued at the date of such total and permanent disability. All rights to exercise the Option shall expire and be of no further force or effect after such six month period. Unless changed by the Compensation Committee, "disability" means that the Optionee ceases to be an employee on account of permanent and total disability as a result of which the Optionee shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long term disability policy applicable to the Optionee. To the extent that Optionee was not entitled to exercise the Option at the Termination Date, or if Optionee does not exercise such Option (to the extent otherwise so entitled) within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate. DEATH OF OPTIONEE. In the event of the death of Optionee, the Option may be exercised in full at any time within six (6) months following the date of death (but in no event later than expiration date of the Option), by Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, even if the right to exercise shall not have otherwise accrued at the date of death.

EXHIBIT 10.74 ------------- FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. 2002 UNIVERSAL STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT -------------------------------- This Restricted Stock Award Agreement (this "Agreement") is made as of the Award Date set forth in the Notice of Restricted Stock Award (the "Notice of Award") between Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") and the Participant named therein ("Participant"). WITNESSETH: WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has adopted the Franklin Resources, Inc. 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (the "2002 Plan"), authorizing the grant of common stock of the Company ("Stock") to eligible individuals in connection with the performance of services for the Company and its Subsidiaries, as defined in said 2002 Plan, which is incorporated herein by this reference (capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the meaning set forth in the 2002 Plan); WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has also adopted the Franklin Resources, Inc. Amended and Restated Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (the "AIP") to reward eligible individuals for contributions made to the Company by providing them an opportunity to receive an award based on the Company's performance during a particular fiscal year; WHEREAS, awards under the AIP may be paid in Stock pursuant to the 2002 Plan; and WHEREAS, the Company recognizes the efforts and contributions of Participant on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, as a reward for such efforts and contributions, has determined to pay the Participant an award under the AIP in Stock provided for in this Agreement, subject to certain restrictions. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 1. RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD. The Company is issuing to Participant shares of Stock as set forth in the Notice of Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Participant as owner thereof as set forth in this Agreement. Such shares are being issued in book entry form and maintained on the books of the Bank of New York, the Company's transfer agent, or any successor thereto. All shares of Stock issued hereunder shall be deemed issued to Participant as fully paid and non assessable shares, and Participant shall have all rights of a shareholder with respect thereto, including the right to vote, to receive dividends (including stock dividends), to participate in stock splits or other recapitalizations, and to exchange such shares in a merger, consolidation or other reorganization. The Company shall pay any applicable stock transfer taxes. Participant hereby acknowledges that Participant is acquiring the Stock issued hereunder for investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof, and that Participant does not intend to subdivide Participant's interest in the Stock with any other person. 2. TRANSFER RESTRICTION. (a) No Stock issued to Participant hereunder shall be sold, transferred by gift, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise transferred or disposed of by Participant prior to the date on which it becomes vested under paragraph 3. This paragraph shall not preclude the Participant from exchanging the Stock
awarded hereunder pursuant to a cash or stock tender offer, merger, reorganization or consolidation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any securities (including stock dividends and stock splits) received with respect to shares of Stock which are not yet vested under paragraph 3 shall be subject to the provisions of this Agreement in the same manner and shall become fully vested at the same time as the Stock with respect to which such additional securities were issued. (b) Participant acknowledges that, from time to time, the Company may be in a "Blackout Period" and/or subject to applicable securities laws that could subject the Participant to liability for engaging in any transaction involving the sale of the Company's shares. Participant further acknowledges and agrees that, prior to the sale of any shares acquired under this Award, it is Participant's responsibility to determine whether or not such sale of shares will subject Participant to liability under insider trading rules or other applicable securities laws. 3. VESTING. (a) Participant's interest in the Stock awarded under paragraph 1 shall become vested and nonforfeitable in accordance with the Vesting Schedule in the Notice of Award so long as Participant maintains Continuous Status as an Employee of the Company or a Subsidiary. Upon vesting, the Company shall, within thirty (30) days of such vesting, deliver to Participant the certificates evidencing the nonforfeitable shares, provided the withholding requirements of paragraph 4 have been satisfied. (b) If Participant ceases to maintain Continuous Status as an Employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason other than death or disability (as described in subparagraph (c)), all shares of Stock to the extent not yet vested under subparagraph (a) on the date Participant ceases to be a full-time employee shall be forfeited by Participant without payment of any consideration to Participant therefor. Any shares of Stock so forfeited shall be canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares, to be held for future distributions by the Company's 2002 Plan. (c) If Participant dies or in the event of termination of Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee as a result of disability (as determined by the Board in accordance with the policies of the Company) while a full-time employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Participant's interest in all shares of Stock awarded hereunder shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board, "disability" means that the Participant ceases to be an employee on account of permanent and total disability as a result of which the Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long term disability policy. 4. WITHHOLDING OF TAXES. (a) GENERAL. Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by Participant in connection with the Stock awarded, regardless of any action the Company or any of its Subsidiaries takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Stock awarded. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of the Stock awarded or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Stock. The Company and its Subsidiaries do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the award to reduce or eliminate Participant's tax liability. (b) PAYMENT OF WITHHOLDING TAXES. Prior to any event in connection with the Stock awarded (e.g., vesting) that the Company determines may result in any tax withholding obligation, whether United States federal, state, local or non-U.S., including any employment tax obligation (the "Tax Withholding
Obligation"), Participant must arrange for the satisfaction of the minimum amount of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company. (i) BY SHARE WITHHOLDING. Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, Participant authorizes the Company (in the exercise of its sole discretion) to withhold from those shares of Stock issuable to Participant the whole number of shares sufficient to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Participant acknowledges that the withheld shares may not be sufficient to satisfy Participant's minimum Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, Participant agrees to pay to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the withholding of shares described above. Share withholding will generally be used to satisfy the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation of individuals subject to the short-swing profit restrictions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. (ii) BY SALE OF SHARES. Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, Participant's acceptance of the Stock awarded constitutes Participant's instruction and authorization to the Company and any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose to sell on Participant's behalf a whole number of shares from those shares of Stock issuable to Participant as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Such shares will be sold on the day such Tax Withholding Obligation arises (e.g., a vesting date) or as soon thereafter as practicable. Participant will be responsible for all broker's fees and other costs of sale, and Participant agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale. To the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed Participant's minimum Tax Withholding Obligation, the Company agrees to pay such excess in cash to Participant. Participant acknowledges that the Company or its designee is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price, and that the proceeds of any such sale may not be sufficient to satisfy Participant's minimum Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, Participant agrees to pay to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the sale of shares described above. (iii) BY CHECK, WIRE TRANSFER OR OTHER MEANS. At any time not less than five (5) business days (or such fewer number of days as determined by the Committee or its designee) before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises (e.g., a vesting date), Participant may elect to satisfy Participant's minimum Tax Withholding Obligation by delivering to the Company an amount that the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation by (x) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (y) delivery of a certified check payable to the Company, or (z) such other means as specified from time to time by the Committee or its designee. 5. SUCCESSORS. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. Nothing contained in the Amended Plan or this Agreement shall be interpreted as imposing any liability on the Company or the Committee in favor of any Participant or any purchaser or other transferee of Stock with respect to any loss, cost or expense which such Participant or purchaser may incur in connection with, or arising out of any transaction involving any shares of Stock subject to the 2002 Plan or this Agreement. 6. INTEGRATION. The terms of the 2002 Plan and this Agreement are intended by the Company and the Participant to be the final expression of their agreement with respect to the shares of Stock and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous agreement. The Company and Participant further intend that the 2002 Plan and this Agreement shall constitute the complete and exclusive statement
of their terms and that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may be introduced in any arbitration, judicial, administrative or other legal proceeding involving the 2002 Plan or this Agreement. Accordingly, the 2002 Plan and this Agreement contain the entire understanding between the parties and supersede all prior oral, written and implied agreements, understandings, commitments and practices among the parties. 7. WAIVERS. Any failure to enforce any terms or conditions of the 2002 Plan or this Agreement by the Company or by Participant shall not be deemed a waiver of that term or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power for all or any other times. 8. SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. If any provision of the 2002 Plan or this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision thereof; and the Amended Plan and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if neither of them included such provision. 9. COMMITTEE DECISIONS CONCLUSIVE. All decisions of the Committee arising under the 2002 Plan or under this Agreement shall be conclusive. 10. MANDATORY ARBITRATION. To the extent permitted by law, any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its meaning or interpretation, shall be resolved solely by arbitration before an arbitrator selected in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The location for the arbitration shall be in the county or comparable jurisdiction of Participant's employment. Judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each party shall pay an equal share of the arbitrator's fees. All statutes of limitation which would otherwise be applicable shall apply to any arbitration proceeding under this paragraph. The provisions of this paragraph are intended by Participant and Company to be exclusive for all purposes and applicable to any and all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement. The arbitrator who hears and decides any dispute shall have jurisdiction and authority only to award compensatory damages to make whole a person or entity sustaining foreseeable economic damages, and, shall not have jurisdiction and authority to make any other award of any type, including without limitation, punitive damages, unforeseeable economic damage, damages for pain, suffering or emotional distress, or any other kind or form of damages. The remedy, if any, awarded by the arbitrator shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any dispute which is subject to arbitration under this paragraph. 11. DELAWARE LAW. The 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced according to the laws of the State of Delaware to the extent not preempted by the federal laws of the United States of America.

EXHIBIT 10.75 ------------- FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. 2002 UNIVERSAL STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT ---------------------- 1. GRANT OF OPTION. FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), hereby grants to the Optionee (the "Optionee") named in the Notice of Grant, an option (the "Option") to purchase a number of shares (the "Shares"), as set forth in the Notice of Grant, at the exercise price per share set forth in the Notice of Grant (the "Exercise Price"), subject to the terms, conditions and definitions of the 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (the "2002 Plan"), adopted by the Company, which is incorporated herein by reference. In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the 2002 Plan and the terms and conditions of this Stock Option Agreement (the "Option Agreement"), the terms and conditions of the 2002 Plan shall prevail. Unless otherwise defined herein, the terms defined in the 2002 Plan shall have the same defined meanings in this Option Agreement. If designated in the Notice of Grant as an Incentive Stock Option, this Option is intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option under Section 422 of the Code. 2. EXERCISE OF OPTION. (a) RIGHT TO EXERCISE. This Option is exercisable during its term in accordance with the Exercise Schedule set out in the Notice of Grant and the applicable provisions of the 2002 Plan and this Option Agreement. (b) METHOD OF EXERCISE. This Option is exercisable by delivery of an exercise notice, in the form provided by the Company and attached to this Agreement as Attachment 1 (the "Exercise Notice"), which shall state the election to exercise the Option, the number of Shares in respect of which the Option is being exercised (the "Exercised Shares") and the manner of exercise. The Exercise Notice shall be signed by the Optionee and shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Company. The Exercise Notice shall be accompanied by payment of the aggregate Exercise Price as to all Exercised Shares. This Option shall be deemed to be exercised upon receipt by the Company of such fully executed Exercise Notice accompanied by such aggregate Exercise Price in good funds. No Shares shall be issued pursuant to the exercise of this Option unless such issuance and exercise complies with all relevant provisions of law and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the Shares are then listed. Assuming such compliance, for income tax purposes the Exercised Shares shall be considered transferred to the Optionee on the date the Option is exercised with respect to such Exercised Shares. 3. METHOD OF PAYMENT. Payment of the aggregate Exercise Price shall be made in United States dollars by delivery of (i) cash, (ii) check, or in the sole and absolute discretion of the Company (iii) authorization for the Company to retain from the total number of Exercised Shares that number of Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the Exercise Price for the total number of Exercised Shares, or (iv) authorization for a broker designated by the Company to sell that number of Exercised Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the Exercise Price for the total number of Exercised Shares, or (v) by delivery of other shares (by delivery of certificates or attestation) which (x) either have been owned by the Optionee for more than six months on the date of surrender or

RESTRICTIONS ON EXERCISE. (a) This Option may not be exercised if the issuance of such Shares upon such exercise or the method of payment of consideration for such shares would constitute a violation of any applicable United States federal or state securities or other law or regulation, including any rule under Part 207 of Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations ("Regulation G") as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board, or applicable laws of any jurisdiction pertaining to the Optionee. (b) Optionee acknowledges that, from time to time, the Company may be in a "Blackout Period" and/or subject to applicable securities laws that could subject the Optionee to liability for engaging in any transaction involving the sale of the Company's shares. Optionee further acknowledges and agrees that, prior to the sale of any shares acquired under this Award, it is Optionee's responsibility to determine whether or not such sale of shares will subject Optionee to liability under insider trading rules or other applicable securities laws. 5.

To the extent that Optionee was not entitled to exercise the Option at the Termination Date, or if Optionee does not exercise such Option (to the extent otherwise so entitled) within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate. 7.

All rights to exercise the Option shall expire and be of no further force or effect after such six month period. 8. NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTION. This Option may not be transferred in any manner otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised during the lifetime of Optionee only by the Optionee. The terms of this Option shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and assigns of the Optionee. 9. TERM OF OPTION. This Option may be exercised only until the Expiration Date set out in the Notice of Grant, and may be exercised during such term only in accordance with the 2002 Plan and the
terms of this Option. The limitations set out in Section 2 of the 2002 Plan regarding option terms and options granted to more than ten percent (10%) shareholders shall apply to this Option. 10. TAX CONSEQUENCES. There are various tax consequences applicable upon the exercise of this stock option and the sale of stock acquired thereunder. Additionally, if this Option is an Incentive Stock Option that is first exercisable for more than $100,000 worth of Shares in any calendar year (as calculated based on fair market value at the date of grant), the portion of the Option first exercisable for greater than $100,000 worth of Shares will be treated as a nonstatutory stock option for tax purposes, notwithstanding the designation as an Incentive Stock Option on the Notice of Grant. THE OPTIONEE SHOULD CONSULT A TAX ADVISER BEFORE EXERCISING THIS OPTION OR DISPOSING OF THE SHARES. 11. ADJUSTMENTS. Exercise of the Option, as provided for above, may be made in full or in part, except that, in the event of an adjustment in the number of shares covered by this Option, as provided for in the 2002 Plan, resulting in other than a whole number of shares, then the Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a share, but shall be deemed to be for the nearest whole number of shares following standard rounding principles. Payments hereunder shall be rounded to the nearest cent following standard rounding principles. 12. WAIVERS. Any failure to enforce any terms or conditions of the 2002 Plan or this Agreement by the Company or by Optionee shall not be deemed a waiver of that term or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power for all or any other times. 13. SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. If any provision of the 2002 Plan or this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision thereof; and the 2002 Plan and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if neither of them included such provision. 14. COMMITTEE DECISIONS CONCLUSIVE. All decisions of the Committee arising under the 2002 Plan or under this Agreement shall be conclusive. 15. MANDATORY ARBITRATION. To the extent permitted by law, any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its meaning or interpretation, shall be resolved solely by arbitration before an arbitrator selected in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The location for the arbitration shall be in the county or comparable jurisdiction of Optionee's employment. Judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each party shall pay an equal share of the arbitrator's fees. All statutes of limitation which would otherwise be applicable shall apply to any arbitration proceeding under this paragraph. The provisions of this paragraph are intended by Optionee and Company to be exclusive for all purposes and applicable to any and all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement. The arbitrator who hears and decides any dispute shall have jurisdiction and authority only to award compensatory damages to make whole a person or entity sustaining foreseeable economic damages, and, shall not have jurisdiction and authority to make any other award of any type, including without limitation, punitive damages, unforeseeable economic damage, damages for pain, suffering or emotional distress, or any other kind or form of damages. The remedy, if any, awarded by the arbitrator shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any dispute which is subject to arbitration under this paragraph. 16. DELAWARE LAW. The 2002 Plan and this Option (including the Notice of Grant, the Option Agreement and any attachments hereto) shall be construed and enforced according to the laws of the State of Delaware to the extent not preempted by the federal laws of the United States of America.
