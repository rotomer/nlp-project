(Franklin Templeton Investments) (NYSE: BEN) (the "Company") announced today that Franklin Templeton Distributors, Inc. ("FTDI") reached an agreement with the California Attorney General's Office ("CAGO"), resolving the issues resulting from the CAGO's investigation concerning marketing support payments to securities dealers who sell fund shares. The Company continues to be in discussions towards resolving the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) investigation related to this matter. The investigations were previously disclosed by the Company earlier this year in SEC filings and press releases. The Company believes that the settlement of this matter is in the best interest of the Company and its fund shareholders. Under the terms of the settlement with the CAGO, FTDI neither admits nor denies allegations in the complaint and has agreed to pay $2 million as a civil penalty, $14 million to Franklin Templeton funds and $2 million to the CAGO. The CAGO settlement recognized certain voluntary measures and undertakings of the Company concerning marketing support payments to securities dealers who sell fund shares including the fact that Franklin Templeton had eliminated the practice of using brokerage commissions to recognize funds sales in November 2003. As a result of the CAGO settlement, the previously announced results for the quarter and fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 will be adjusted to include an additional charge to income of $18.5 million ($12.2 million net of tax), which is in addition to amounts accrued for ongoing governmental investigations, proceedings and actions in quarters through June 30, 2004. Franklin Resources, Inc. [NYSE:BEN], is a global investment organization operating as Franklin Templeton Investments. Franklin Templeton Investments provides global and domestic investment management solutions managed by its Franklin, Templeton, Mutual Series and Fiduciary Trust investment teams.
