ITEM 5.02 DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR PRINCIPAL OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF PRINCIPAL OFFICERS. (b) Mr. James A. McCarthy resigned from the Board of Directors of Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") on December 2, 2004. In recognition of his many years of valuable service to the Company and its shareholders and the belief and desire of the Corporate Governance Committee of the Board that he will continue to be a valuable resource for the Board in the future, the Corporate Governance Committee, with Mr. McCarthy's consent, intends to recommend to the Board that it name Mr. McCarthy as a Director Emeritus. In order for the Board to be composed of a majority of independent directors under the corporate governance rules of the New York Stock Exchange, Ms. Anne M. Tatlock also resigned from the Board on December 2, 2004. Ms. Tatlock will continue to serve in all other current positions she holds with the Company, including as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International, a subsidiary of the Company. The Corporate Governance Committee is considering nominating additional independent individuals for appointment or election to the Board. In light of the Corporate Governance Committee's desire to have Ms. Tatlock return to the Board, the Corporate Governance Committee expects to recommend to the Board that it re-appoint Ms. Tatlock as a Director at such time as the composition of the Board permits such appointment.
