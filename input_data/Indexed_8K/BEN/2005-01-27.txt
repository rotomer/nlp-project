ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. DEFERRED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENT FOR DIRECTOR'S FEES WITH SAMUEL ARMACOST On January 21, 2005, Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company" or "Franklin") entered into a Franklin Resources, Inc. Deferred Compensation Arrangement for Director's Fees (the "Arrangement") with Samuel H. Armacost, one of the Company's non-employee directors, pursuant to which Mr. Armacost has elected to defer delivery of all annual and other stock grants that otherwise would have been made to him as compensation for service as a director of the Company until a future date. Under the terms of the Arrangement, Mr. Armacost may make elections from time to time to defer payment of some or all of his director's fees or annual or other stock grants. Except with the initial election, which Mr. Armacost had to make within 30 days of becoming eligible to participate under the Arrangement, any future elections by Mr. Armacost must be made prior to the calendar year in which Mr. Armacost earns the compensation, although Mr. Armacost may elect, at any time, to change his distribution date(s), provided that certain conditions, as set out in the Arrangement, with regard to the election and the payment of distributions are met. The Company will allocate performance units for the benefit of Mr. Armacost equivalent to all such deferred amounts. The performance units constitute notional shares of common stock of the Company and are credited with notional dividends at the same time, in the same form, and in equivalent amounts as dividends that are payable from time to time on shares of common stock of the Company. Any such notional dividends are reallocated to acquire additional performance units for the benefit of Mr. Armacost equivalent to such dividend amounts. Under the Arrangement, the value of such performance units, as adjusted for losses or gains and notional dividends through the date of distribution, shall be paid out in cash to Mr. Armacost on date(s) determined by him, subject to certain exceptions as set out in the Arrangement. Mr. Armacost may terminate his participation in the Arrangement at any time prior to December 31, 2005 with regard to any deferrals made prior to that time as well as any future deferrals and, upon such termination, distribution of all of Mr. Armacost's then deferred amounts shall be made in cash and shall occur as soon as practicable. The Company may amend or suspend the Arrangement at any time and for any reason, provided that no amendment of the Arrangement may adversely affect Mr. Armacost's rights under the Arrangement without his prior written consent. This brief description of the Arrangement is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Arrangement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference. FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. 2002 UNIVERSAL STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED AND RESTATED On January 25, 2005, the stockholders of the Company at the 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company approved the amendment and restatement of the Company's 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (as amended and restated, the "2002 Stock Plan"). The primary purposes of the amendment and restatement were to (a) add additional performance measures applicable to the grant of awards under the Company's 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (the "Original Plan") intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and (b) expand the ability of the administrator of the Original Plan to adjust awards issued under the plan in connection with various changes in the capitalization of the Company. The brief description of the 2002 Stock Plan set forth below is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2002 Stock Plan, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference. PURPOSE - ------- The 2002 Stock Plan is intended to: (i) attract and retain persons eligible to participate in the plan; (ii) motivate employees, by means of appropriate incentives, to achieve long-range performance goals; (iii) provide incentive compensation opportunities that are competitive with those of other similar companies; and (iv) further align employees' interests with those of Franklin's other stockholders through compensation that is based on Franklin's common stock. ADMINISTRATION OF THE 2002 STOCK PLAN - ------------------------------------- The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Compensation Committee"), as the administrator of the 2002 Stock Plan, determines and approves the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock units, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance shares to employees. The Compensation Committee will, with regard to each stock option, determine the number of shares subject to the option, the manner and time of the option's exercise and vesting, and the exercise price per share of stock subject to the option. The exercise price for incentive stock options may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date the option is granted (or 110%, in the case of an incentive stock option granted to any employee who owns stock representing more than 10% of the combined voting power of Franklin or any parent or subsidiary of Franklin). In the case of all other awards granted under the 2002 Stock Plan, the exercise or purchase price shall be determined by the Compensation Committee. SHARES AUTHORIZED - ----------------- The 2002 Stock Plan authorizes 30,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2002 Stock Plan. ELIGIBILITY - ----------- Under the terms of the 2002 Stock Plan, any key executive or other employee of Franklin or any of its subsidiaries is eligible to participate. TERM OF AWARDS - -------------- The term of any incentive stock option may not be for more than ten years (or five years in the case of an incentive stock option granted to any participant who owns stock representing more than 10%
of the combined voting power of Franklin or any parent or subsidiary of the Company). The term of all other awards shall be determined by the Compensation Committee. TRANSFERABILITY - --------------- An employee's rights under the 2002 Stock Plan may not be assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. PERFORMANCE BASED COMPENSATION - ------------------------------ The maximum number of shares with respect to which options and stock appreciation rights may be granted to a participant during a calendar year is 400,000 shares. The foregoing limitation shall be adjusted proportionately by the Compensation Committee in connection with any change in Franklin's capitalization due to a stock split, stock dividend or similar event affecting the common stock of Franklin. Under Code Section 162(m) no deduction is allowed in any taxable year of Franklin for compensation in excess of $1 million paid to Franklin's chief executive officer and the four other most highly compensated officers of Franklin. An exception to this rule applies to compensation that is paid pursuant to a stock incentive plan approved by stockholders and that specifies, among other things, the maximum number of shares with respect to which options and stock appreciation rights may be granted to eligible participants under such plan during a specified period. Compensation paid pursuant to options or stock appreciation rights granted under such a plan and with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of Franklin's common stock on the date of grant is deemed to be inherently performance-based, since such awards provide value to participants only if the stock price appreciates. For awards of stock units, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance shares that are intended to be performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, the maximum number of shares subject to such awards that may be granted to a participant during a calendar year is 1,000,000 shares (regardless of when such shares are deliverable to the participant). In order for such awards to qualify as performance-based compensation, the Compensation Committee must establish a performance goal with respect to such award in writing not later than 90 days after the commencement of the services to which it relates and while the outcome is substantially uncertain. In addition, the performance goal must be stated in terms of an objective formula or standard. Under the 2002 Stock Plan, the Compensation Committee may use the following performance criteria when granting performance-based awards: earnings per share; pre-tax operating income; the value of Franklin stock (i.e., stock price); annual revenue; budget comparisons; controllable profits; expense management; improvements in capital structure; operating income; net income; net sales; profit margins; profitability of an identifiable business unit or product; return on investments; return on sales; return on stockholders' equity; total return to stockholders; and performance of Franklin relative to a peer group of companies on any of the foregoing measures. The performance criteria may be applicable to Franklin and/or any of its individual business units and may differ from participant to participant.
CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION - ------------------------- The 2002 Stock Plan provides that subject to any required action by the stockholders of Franklin, (a) the number and/or class of securities covered by each outstanding award, (b) the price per share covered by each such outstanding award, (c) the number and/or class of securities which have been authorized for issuance under the 2002 Stock Plan but as to which no awards have yet been granted or which have been returned to the 2002 Stock Plan upon cancellation or expiration of an award, and (d) the maximum number of options, stock appreciation rights, stock unit awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards and performance share awards which may be granted to any participant in any one-calendar-year period shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of common stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the common stock, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of common stock effected without receipt of consideration by Franklin. Such adjustment will be made by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee may also make, in its discretion, adjustments described in (a) - (d) above in the event of any distribution of cash or other assets to stockholders other than an ordinary cash dividend. In determining adjustments to be made, the Compensation Committee may take into account such factors as it deems appropriate, including (i) the restrictions of applicable law, (ii) the potential tax, accounting or other consequences of an adjustment and (iii) the possibility that some participants might receive an adjustment and a distribution or other unintended benefit, and in light of such factors or circumstances may make adjustments that are not uniform or proportionate among outstanding awards, modify vesting dates, defer the delivery of stock certificates or make other equitable adjustments. Any such adjustments to outstanding awards will be effected in a manner that precludes the enlargement of rights and benefits under such awards. Any adjustments, determinations or interpretations made by the Compensation Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive. AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION - ------------------------- The Board of Directors of Franklin may at any time terminate or amend the 2002 Stock Plan. However, no such termination may affect awards previously granted, nor may an amendment make any change in any award previously granted which adversely affects the rights of any participant. In addition, to the extent necessary to comply with securities and tax laws, Franklin will obtain stockholder approval of such termination or such amendments.

In its sole discretion, the Committee may permit acceleration of the time or schedule or a payment under the Arrangement as may be necessary to comply with a certificate of divestiture (as defined in Code Section 1043(b)(2)).

Upon the death of the Participant prior to complete distribution to him of the entire balance of his Deferred Compensation Account, the remaining balance of his Deferred Compensation Account on the date of death shall be payable to the Participant's Beneficiary. 4.7 PARTICIPANT'S RIGHTS UNSECURED. The right of the Participant and his Beneficiary to receive a distribution hereunder shall be an unsecured claim against the general assets of the Company, and neither the Participant nor his Beneficiary shall have any rights in or against any amount credited to the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account or any other specific assets of the Company, except as otherwise provided in the Trust Agreement. The Deferred Compensation Account shall be kept solely as a nominal account, may be carried in cash or any other liquid assets, may be invested in Common Stock, or may be invested in any other assets as may be selected by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion.

Any benefits not paid from the Trust shall be paid from the Company's general funds, and any benefits paid from the Trust shall be credited against and reduce by a corresponding amount the Company's liability under the Arrangement. All Trust Funds shall be subject to the claims of general creditors of the Company in the event the Company is insolvent as defined in the Trust Agreement. The obligations of the Company to pay benefits under the Arrangement and the obligation of the Trustee to pay benefits under the Trust constitute an unfunded, unsecured promise to pay benefits in the future and the Participant and his Beneficiary shall have no greater rights than general creditors of the Company. No Trust established hereunder may hold assets located outside of the United States nor provide that assets will become restricted to the provision of benefits under the Arrangement in connection with a change in the Company's financial health. ARTICLE 7 AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION 7.1 AMENDMENT.

Any amendment or suspension of the Arrangement must be pursuant to a written document that is executed by a duly-authorized officer of the Company. Except as required under Code Section 409A, no Deferrals shall be made during any suspension of the Arrangement or after termination of the Arrangement. 7.2 AUTOMATIC TERMINATION OF THE ARRANGEMENT.

The Committee shall administer and interpret this Arrangement in accordance with the provisions of the Arrangement and the Trust Agreement (if any) and shall have the authority in its discretion to adopt, amend or rescind such rules and regulations as it deems advisable in the administration of the Arrangement. Any determination or decision by the Committee shall be made in its sole discretion and shall be conclusive and binding on all persons who at any time have or claim to have any interest under this Arrangement. Notwithstanding anything in the Arrangement to the contrary, the Committee shall administer and construe the 7
Arrangement in accordance with Code Section 409A, the regulations thereunder, and any other published interpretive authority, as issued or amended from time to time 8.2 LIABILITY OF COMMITTEE; INDEMNIFICATION.

The Company will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the members of the Committee from and against any and all liabilities, costs, and expenses incurred by such person(s) as a result of any act, or omission, in connection with the performance of such persons' duties, responsibilities, and obligations under the Arrangement, other than such liabilities, costs, and expenses as may result from the bad faith, gross misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty, failure to follow the lawful instructions of the Board or criminal acts of such persons. All members of the Board or the Committee and each and any officer or employee of the Company acting on their behalf shall, to the extent permitted by law, be fully indemnified and protected by the Company in respect of any such action, determination or interpretation. 8.3 EXPENSES. The cost of the establishment and the adoption of the Arrangement by the Company, including but not limited to legal and accounting fees, shall be borne by the Company. The expenses of administering the Arrangement shall be borne by the Company, and the Company shall bear, and shall not be reimbursed by the Trust, for any tax liability of the Company associated with the investment of assets held by the Trust. ARTICLE 9 GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS 9.1 RIGHTS AGAINST COMPANY. Except as expressly provided by the Arrangement, the establishment of this Arrangement shall not be construed as giving to the Participant, any employee or any person any legal, equitable or other rights against the Company, or against its officers, directors, agents or members, or as giving to the Participant or Beneficiary any equity or other interest in the assets or business of the Company or giving the Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Company. In no event shall the terms of service of the Participant, expressed or implied, be modified or in any way affected by the adoption of the Arrangement or Trust or any election under the Arrangement made by the Participant. The rights of the Participant or his Beneficiary hereunder shall be solely those of an unsecured general creditor of the Company. 9.2 CLAIMS PROCEDURES.

EXHIBIT 10.2 FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. 2002 UNIVERSAL STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (as amended and restated December 16, 2004) 1. GENERAL 1.1 PURPOSE. The Franklin Resources, Inc. 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (the "2002 Stock Plan") has been established by Franklin Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company") to (i) attract and retain persons eligible to participate in the 2002 Stock Plan; (ii) motivate employees, by means of appropriate incentives, to achieve long-range performance goals; (iii) provide incentive compensation opportunities that are competitive with those of other similar companies; and (iv) further identify employees' interests with those of the Company's other stockholders through compensation that is based on the Company's common stock; and thereby promote the long-term financial interest of the Company and the Subsidiaries. 1.2 PARTICIPATION. Subject to the terms and conditions of the 2002 Stock Plan, the Committee shall determine and designate, from time to time, from among the Participants, those persons who will be granted one or more Awards under the 2002 Stock Plan. In the discretion of the Committee, a Participant may be granted any Award permitted under the provisions of the 2002 Stock Plan, and more than one Award may be granted to a Participant. Awards may be granted as alternatives to or replacement of awards outstanding under the 2002 Stock Plan, or any other plan or arrangement of the Company or a Subsidiary (including a plan or arrangement of a business or entity, all or a portion of which is acquired by the Company or a Subsidiary). 1.3 OPERATION, ADMINISTRATION, AND DEFINITIONS. The operation and administration of the 2002 Stock Plan, including the Awards made under the 2002 Stock Plan, shall be subject to the provisions of Section 4 (relating to operation and administration). Capitalized terms in the 2002 Stock Plan shall be defined as set forth in the 2002 Stock Plan (including the definition provisions of Section 8 of the 2002 Stock Plan). 1.4 STOCK SUBJECT TO 2002 STOCK PLAN; SHARE COUNTING. Subject to the provisions of this Section 1.4 and Section 6.1 of the 2002 Stock Plan, the maximum aggregate number of shares which may be delivered pursuant to Awards, including without limitation, Options and SAR's granted under the 2002 Stock Plan, is 30,000,000. The shares may be authorized, but unissued, or reacquired Common Stock. (a) To the extent any Shares covered by an Award are not delivered to a Participant or beneficiary because the Award is forfeited or canceled, or the Shares are not delivered because the Award is settled in cash, such Shares shall not be deemed to have been delivered for purposes of determining the maximum number of Shares available for delivery pursuant to Awards granted under the 2002 Stock Plan. (b) If the exercise price of any Option granted under the 2002 Stock Plan is satisfied by tendering Shares to the Company (by either actual delivery or by attestation), only the number of Shares issued net of the Shares tendered shall be deemed delivered for purposes of
determining the maximum number of Shares available for delivery pursuant to Awards (other than Options) granted under the 2002 Stock Plan. (c) Subject to adjustment under Section 6.1, (i) the maximum number of shares that may be granted to any one individual pursuant to Section 2 (relating to Options and SARs) shall be 400,000 Shares during any one-calendar-year period and (ii) the maximum number of Shares that may be granted to any one individual subject to Section 3 (relating to Stock Unit Awards, Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Unit Awards and Performance Share Awards) shall be 1,000,000 Shares during any one-calendar-year period (regardless of when such Shares are deliverable). 2. OPTIONS AND SARS 2.1 OPTIONS. (a) An Option is a grant of rights to purchase Shares at an Exercise Price established by the Committee. Options granted under this Section 2 may be either Incentive Stock Options ("ISO") or Nonstatutory Stock Options ("NSO"), as determined in the discretion of the Committee. (b) Each Option shall be designated in the written option agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. However, notwithstanding such designations, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Options designated as Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any Optionee during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, such excess Options shall be automatically treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For purposes of this paragraph 2.1(b), Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted, and the Fair Market Value of the Shares shall be determined as of the original date the Option with respect to such Shares is granted. (c) The term of each Option shall be the term stated in the Option Agreement; provided, however, that in the case of any Incentive Stock Option, the term shall be no more than ten (10) years from the date of grant thereof or such shorter term as may be provided in the Option Agreement. However, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Optionee who, at the time the Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Option shall be five (5) years from the date of grant thereof or such shorter term as may be provided in the Option Agreement. (d) The date of grant of an Option shall, for all purposes, be the date on which the Committee makes the determination granting such Option, or such other date as is determined by the Board. Notice of the determination shall be given to each Participant to whom an Option is so granted within a reasonable time after the date of such grant. 2.2 STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS. A "Stock Appreciation Right" ("SAR") is a grant of rights to receive, in cash or Stock (as determined by the Committee), value equal to (or otherwise
based on) the excess of: (a) the Fair Market Value of a specified number of Shares at the time of exercise; over (b) an Exercise Price established by the Committee. 2.3 EXERCISE PRICE. The Exercise Price of each Option and SAR shall be established by the Committee or shall be determined by a method established by the Committee at the time the Option or SAR is granted; provided that: (a) In the case of an ISO, (i) granted to an employee who, at the time of the grant of such Incentive Stock Option, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant. (ii) granted to any employee, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant. 2.4 TIME AND MANNER OF EXERCISE. Options and SARs shall be exercisable in accordance with such terms and conditions and during such periods as may be established by the Committee; subject to the following terms regarding Options: (a) TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT. In the event of termination of an Optionee's Continuous Status as an employee with the Company, such Optionee may, but only within ninety (90) days after the date of such termination (or such other period as is set out by the Committee in the Option Agreement, but in no event later than the expiration date of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement), exercise the Option to the extent that Optionee was entitled to exercise it at the date of such termination. To the extent that Optionee was not entitled to exercise the Option at the date of such termination, or if Optionee does not exercise such Option to the extent so entitled within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate. (b) DISABILITY OF OPTIONEE. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2.4(a) above, in the event of termination of an Optionee's Continuous Status as an employee as a result of disability (as determined by the Board in accordance with the policies of the Company), Optionee may, but only within six (6) months from the date of such termination (or such other period as is set out by the Committee in the Option Agreement, but in no event later than the expiration date of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement), exercise the Option to the extent otherwise entitled to exercise it at the date of such termination. To the extent that Optionee was not entitled to exercise the Option at the date of termination, or if Optionee does not exercise such Option to the extent so entitled within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate. (c) DEATH OF OPTIONEE. In the event of the death of an Optionee, the Option may be exercised, at any time within twelve (12) months following the date of death (or such other period as is set out by the Committee in the Option Agreement, but in no event later than the expiration date of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement), by the Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent the Optionee was entitled to exercise the Option at the date of
death. To the extent that Optionee was not entitled to exercise the Option at the date of termination, or if Optionee does not exercise such Option to the extent so entitled within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate. 2.5 PAYMENT OF EXERCISE PRICE. Payment of the Exercise Price of an Option shall be subject to the following: (a) The full Exercise Price for Shares purchased upon the exercise of any Option shall be paid at the time of such exercise (except that, in the case of an exercise arrangement approved by the Committee and described in paragraph 2.5(b), payment may be made as soon as practicable after the exercise). (b) The consideration to be paid for the Shares to be issued upon exercise of an Option, including the method of payment, shall be determined by the Committee (and, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, shall be determined at the time of grant) and may consist entirely of (i) cash, (ii) check, (iii) other Shares (by delivery of certificates or attestation) which (x) either have been owned by the Optionee for more than six months on the date of surrender or were not acquired, directly or indirectly, from the Company, and (y) have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which said Option shall be exercised, (iv) delivery of authorization for the Company to retain from the total number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised that number of Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the exercise price for the total number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised, (v) delivery of a properly executed exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to the Company the amount of sale or loan proceeds required to pay the exercise price, (vi) irrevocably authorizing a third party to sell Shares (or a sufficient portion of the shares) acquired upon exercise of the Option and remit to the Company a sufficient portion of the sale proceeds to pay the entire Exercise Price and any tax withholding resulting from such exercise, (vii) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment, (viii) or such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance of Shares to the extent permitted under Applicable Laws. 2.6 SETTLEMENT OF AWARD. Shares delivered pursuant to the exercise of an Option or SAR shall be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee may establish in the applicable Award Agreement at the time of grant. Settlement of SARs may be made in Shares (valued at their Fair Market Value at the time of exercise), in cash, or in a combination thereof, as determined in the discretion of the Committee. The Committee, in its discretion, may impose such conditions, restrictions and contingencies with respect to Shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Option or an SAR as the Committee determines to be desirable.
3. OTHER STOCK AWARDS 3.1 DEFINITIONS. (a) A "Stock Unit" Award is the grant of a right to receive Shares in the future. (b) A "Performance Share" Award is a grant of a right to receive Shares or Stock Units which is contingent on the achievement of performance or other objectives during a specified period. (c) A "Restricted Stock" Award is a grant of Shares, and a "Restricted Stock Unit" Award is the grant of a right to receive Shares in the future, with such Shares or right to future delivery of such Shares subject to a risk of forfeiture or other restrictions that will lapse upon the achievement of one or more goals relating to completion of service by the Participant, or achievement of performance or other objectives, as determined by the Committee. 3.2 RESTRICTIONS ON STOCK AWARDS. Each Stock Unit Award, Restricted Stock Award, Restricted Stock Unit Award and Performance Share Award shall be subject to the following: (a) Any such Award shall be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee shall determine. (b) The Committee may designate whether any such Award being granted to any Participant are intended to be "performance-based compensation" as that term is used in Section 162(m) of the Code. Any such Awards designated as intended to be "performance-based compensation" shall be conditioned on the achievement of one or more Performance Measures. The Performance Measures that may be used by the Committee for such Awards shall be based on any one or more of the criteria attached hereto on Attachment I, as selected and further defined by the Committee. The Performance Measures may be applicable to the Company and/or any of its individual business units and may differ from Participant to Participant. For Awards intended to be "performance-based compensation," the grant of the Awards and the establishment of the Performance Measures shall be made during the period required under Section 162(m) of the Code and shall be subject to the individual share limit set out in Section 1.4(c) above. 4. OPERATION AND ADMINISTRATION 4.1 EFFECTIVE DATE. The 2002 Stock Plan became effective as of October 10, 2002. The 2002 Stock Plan shall be unlimited in duration and, in the event of the 2002 Stock Plan termination, shall remain in effect as long as any Awards under it are outstanding; provided, however, that, to the extent required by the Code, no ISO may be granted under the 2002 Stock Plan after October 9, 2012. 4.2 GENERAL RESTRICTIONS. Delivery of Shares or other amounts under the 2002 Stock Plan shall be subject to the following:
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of the 2002 Stock Plan, the Company shall have no liability to deliver any Shares under the 2002 Stock Plan or make any other distribution of benefits under the 2002 Stock Plan unless such delivery or distribution would comply with all applicable laws (including, without limitation, the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933), and the applicable requirements of any securities exchange or similar entity. (b) To the extent that the 2002 Stock Plan provides for issuance of stock certificates to reflect the issuance of Shares, the issuance may be effected on a non-certificated basis, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange. 4.3 TAX WITHHOLDING. All distributions under the 2002 Stock Plan are subject to withholding of all applicable taxes, and the Committee may condition the delivery of any shares or other benefits under the 2002 Stock Plan on satisfaction of the applicable withholding obligations. The Committee, in its discretion, and subject to such requirements as the Committee may impose prior to the occurrence of such withholding, may permit such withholding obligations to be satisfied through cash payment by the Participant, through the surrender of Shares which the Participant already owns, or through the surrender of Shares to which the Participant is otherwise entitled under the 2002 Stock Plan, provided; however, that in either case only the number of Shares sufficient to satisfy the Company's minimum required tax withholding obligations may be surrendered to the Company. 4.4 USE OF SHARES. Subject to the overall limitation on the number of Shares that may be delivered under the 2002 Stock Plan, the Committee may use available Shares as the form of payment for compensation, grants or rights earned or due under any other compensation plans or arrangements of the Company or a Subsidiary, including the plans and arrangements of the Company or a Subsidiary assumed in business combinations. 4.5 DIVIDENDS AND DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS. An Award (including without limitation an Option or SAR Award) may provide the Participant with the right to receive dividend payments or dividend equivalent payments with respect to Stock subject to the Award (both before and after the Stock subject to the Award is earned, vested, or acquired), which payments may be either made currently or credited to an account for the Participant, and may be settled in cash or Stock as determined by the Committee. Any such settlements, and any such crediting of dividends or dividend equivalents or reinvestment in Shares, may be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee shall establish, including the reinvestment of such credited amounts in Stock equivalents. 4.6 PAYMENTS. Awards may be settled through cash payments, the delivery of Shares, the granting of replacement Awards, or combination thereof as the Committee shall determine. Any Award settlement, including payment deferrals, may be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee shall determine. The Committee may permit or require the deferral of any Award payment, subject to such rules and procedures as it may establish, which may include provisions for the payment or crediting of interest, or dividend equivalents, including converting such credits into deferred Stock equivalents. Each Subsidiary shall be liable for payment of cash due under the 2002 Stock Plan with respect to any Participant to the extent that such benefits are attributable to the services rendered for that Subsidiary by the
Participant. Any disputes relating to liability of a Subsidiary for cash payments shall be resolved by the Committee. 4.7 TRANSFERABILITY. Unless specifically provided by the Committee in the Award Agreement, Awards under the 2002 Stock Plan are nontransferable except as designated by the Participant by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. 4.8 FORM AND TIME OF ELECTIONS. Unless otherwise specified herein, each election required or permitted to be made by any Participant or other person entitled to benefits under the 2002 Stock Plan, and any permitted modification, or revocation thereof, shall be in writing filed with the Committee at such times, in such form, and subject to such restrictions and limitations, not inconsistent with the terms of the 2002 Stock Plan, as the Committee shall require. 4.9 AGREEMENT WITH COMPANY. An Award under the 2002 Stock Plan shall be subject to such terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the 2002 Stock Plan, as the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, prescribe. The terms and conditions of any Award to any Participant shall be reflected in such form of written document as is determined by the Committee. A copy of such document shall be provided to the Participant, and the Committee may, but need not require that the Participant shall sign a copy of such document. Such document is referred to in the 2002 Stock Plan as an "Award Agreement" regardless of whether any Participant signature is required. 4.10 ACTION BY COMPANY OR SUBSIDIARY. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary shall be by resolution of its board of directors, or by action of one or more members of the board (including a committee of the board) who are duly authorized to act for the board, or (except to the extent prohibited by applicable law or applicable rules of any stock exchange) by a duly authorized officer of the Company. 4.11 GENDER AND NUMBER. Where the context admits, words in any gender shall include any other gender, words in the singular shall include the plural and the plural shall include the singular. 4.12 LIMITATION OF IMPLIED RIGHTS. (a) Neither a Participant nor any other person shall, by reason of participation in the 2002 Stock Plan, acquire any right in or title to any assets, funds or property of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary whatsoever, including, without limitation, any specific funds, assets, or other property which the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, in their sole discretion, may set aside in anticipation of a liability under the 2002 Stock Plan. A Participant shall have only a contractual right to the Stock or amounts, if any, payable under the 2002 Stock Plan, unsecured by any assets of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, and nothing contained in the 2002 Stock Plan shall constitute a guarantee that the assets of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary shall be sufficient to pay any benefits to any person. (b) The 2002 Stock Plan does not constitute a contract of employment, and selection as a Participant will not give any Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary, nor any right or claim to any benefit under the 2002 Stock Plan, unless such right or claim has specifically accrued under the terms of the 2002 Stock Plan.
Except as otherwise provided in the 2002 Stock Plan, no Award under the 2002 Stock Plan shall confer upon the holder thereof any rights as a stockholder of the Company prior to the date on which the individual fulfills all conditions for receipt of such rights. 5. COMMITTEE 5.1 COMMITTEE. The authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the 2002 Stock Plan shall be vested in a committee (the "Committee") in accordance with this Section 5. The Committee shall be selected by the Board, and shall be comprised, unless otherwise determined by the Board, solely of not less than two members of the Board who shall be "outside" directors within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.162-27(e)(3) under Section 162(m) of the Code. With respect to Awards granted under the 2002 Stock Plan that are not intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee shall be composed of two or more members of the Board who are not employees of the Company. If the Committee does not exist, or for any other reason determined by the Board, the Board may take any action under the 2002 Stock Plan that would otherwise be the responsibility of the Committee. 5.2 POWERS OF COMMITTEE. The Committee's administration of the 2002 Stock Plan shall be subject to the following: (a) Subject to the provisions of the 2002 Stock Plan, the Committee will have the authority and discretion to select from among the Participants those persons who shall receive Awards, to determine the time or times of receipt, to determine the types of Awards and the number of shares covered by the Awards, to establish the terms, conditions, performance criteria (except that for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code, performance measures shall be based on one or more of the criteria set out on Attachment I hereto) , restrictions, and other provisions of such Awards, and (subject to Section 7) to cancel or suspend Awards. (b) To the extent that the Committee determines that the restrictions imposed by the 2002 Stock Plan preclude the achievement of the material purposes of the Awards in jurisdictions outside the United States, the Committee will have the authority and discretion to modify those restrictions as the Committee determines to be necessary or appropriate to conform to applicable requirements or practices of jurisdictions outside of the United States. (c) The Committee may grant Awards to Participants who are subject to the tax laws of nations other than the United States, which Awards may have terms and conditions as determined by the Committee as necessary to comply with applicable foreign laws. The Committee may take any action which it deems advisable to obtain approval of such Awards by the appropriate foreign government entity; provided however that no such Awards may be granted under this 2002 Stock Plan and no action may be taken which would result in a violation of the Exchange Act, the Code or any other applicable law. (d) The Committee will have the authority and discretion to interpret the 2002 Stock Plan, to establish, amend, and rescind any rules and regulations relating to the 2002 Stock Plan, to determine the terms and provisions of any Award Agreement made pursuant to the 2002
Stock Plan, and to make all other determinations that may be necessary or advisable for the administration of the 2002 Stock Plan. (e) Any interpretation of the 2002 Stock Plan by the Committee and any decision made by it under the 2002 Stock Plan is final and binding on all persons. (f) In controlling and managing the operation and administration of the 2002 Stock Plan, the Committee shall take action in a manner that conforms to the articles and by-laws of the Company, and applicable state corporate law. 5.3 DELEGATION BY COMMITTEE. Except to the extent prohibited by Applicable Law or the applicable rules of a stock exchange, the Committee may allocate all or any portion of its responsibilities and powers to any one or more of its members and may delegate all or any part of its administrative duties to any person or persons selected by it. Any such allocation or delegation may be revoked by the Committee at any time. 5.4 INFORMATION TO BE FURNISHED TO COMMITTEE. The Company and its Parent and Subsidiaries shall furnish the Committee with such data and information as it determines may be required for it to discharge its duties. The records of the Company and its Parent and Subsidiaries as to a Participant's employment, termination of employment, leave of absence, reemployment and compensation shall be conclusive on all persons unless determined to be incorrect. Participants entitled to benefits under the 2002 Stock Plan must furnish the Committee such evidence, data or information as the Committee considers desirable to carry out the terms of the 2002 Stock Plan. 6. ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION OR CORPORATE TRANSACTION 6.1 CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION. Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company, (a) the number and/or class of securities covered by each outstanding Award, (b) the price per share covered by each such outstanding Award, (c) the number and/or class of securities which have been authorized for issuance under the 2002 Stock Plan but as to which no Awards have yet been granted or which have been returned to the 2002 Stock Plan upon cancellation or expiration of an Award, and (d) the maximum number of Options, SARs, Stock Unit Awards, Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Units Awards and Performance Share Awards which may be granted to any Participant in any one-calendar-year period shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Common Stock, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration." Such adjustment shall be made by the Committee. The Committee may also make, in its discretion, adjustments described in (a)-(d) of this Section 6.1 in the event of any distribution of cash or other assets to stockholders other than an ordinary cash dividend. In determining adjustments to be made under this Section 6.1, the Committee may take into account such factors as it deems appropriate, including (i) the restrictions of applicable law, (ii) the potential tax, accounting or other consequences of an
adjustment and (iii) the possibility that some Participants might receive an adjustment and a distribution or other unintended benefit, and in light of such factors or circumstances may make adjustments that are not uniform or proportionate among outstanding Awards, modify vesting dates, defer the delivery of stock certificates or make other equitable adjustments. Any such adjustments to outstanding Awards will be effected in a manner that precludes the enlargement of rights and benefits under such Awards. Adjustments, if any, and any determinations or interpretations, including any determination of whether a distribution is other than an ordinary cash dividend, made by the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of Shares of any class, or securities convertible into Shares of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of Common Stock subject to an Award. 6.2 TRANSACTIONS. In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company or of a merger or corporate combination (a "Transaction") in which the successor corporation does not agree to assume the Award or substitute an equivalent Award, the Committee shall make a determination (subject to Section 7) as to the equitable treatment of outstanding Awards under the 2002 Stock Plan and shall notify Participants of such treatment no later than ten (10) days prior to such proposed Transaction. To the extent it has not been previously exercised, an Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed Transaction. 7. AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION The Board may, at any time, amend or terminate the 2002 Stock Plan, provided that no amendment or termination may, in the absence of written consent to the change by the affected Participant (or, if the Participant is not then living, the affected beneficiary), adversely affect the rights of any Participant or beneficiary under any Award granted under the 2002 Stock Plan prior to the date such amendment is adopted by the Board; provided that adjustments pursuant to Section 6.2 shall in no event be deemed to have an adverse effect on any Award. 8.
