ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. FIVE-YEAR FACILITY CREDIT AGREEMENT DATED AS OF JUNE 10, 2005. On June 10, 2005, Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company" or "Franklin") entered into a $420 million Five-Year Facility Credit Agreement with certain banks and a financial institution (collectively, the "Bank Parties"), Bank of America, N.A. and The Bank of New York, as Co-Syndication Agents, Citibank, N.A. and BNP Paribas, as Co-Documentation Agents, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as Sole Bookrunner and Sole Lead Arranger (the "Five-Year Credit Agreement"). The Five-Year Credit Agreement replaces Franklin's $210 million 364-Day revolving credit facility, which matured by its terms on June 2, 2005 and Franklin's $210 million five year revolving credit facility, which was terminated on June 10, 2005, prior to its scheduled expiration date of June 6, 2007. The Company desired to replace both the former 364-Day and five-year credit facilities with a single $420 million five-year credit facility. There were no amounts outstanding under either the former 364-Day or the five-year credit facilities on the respective dates of termination and no early termination penalties were incurred by Franklin. The Five-Year Credit Agreement provides for a $420 million revolving credit facility, of which the entire amount is currently undrawn and available. Under the Five-Year Credit Agreement, the Bank Parties are required to make revolving credit loans to Franklin and Franklin may borrow, repay and re-borrow such amounts from time to time until the maturity of the Five-Year Credit Agreement on June 10, 2010. Franklin may also, at its discretion, borrow amounts under bid loans, where the Bank Parties, at their discretion, can offer to bid on short term loans requested by Franklin based on a competitive auction procedure (the "Bid Loans"). Except for Bid Loans, prepayments and commitment reductions are permitted without premium or penalty upon proper notice and subject to a minimum dollar requirement. Loans under the Five-Year Credit Agreement shall bear interest, depending on the type of loan requested by Franklin, at a rate based on LIBOR plus a margin, at a rate based on an alternate base rate (as such term is defined in the Five-Year Credit Agreement) plus a margin, or an absolute or fixed rate to be determined at the time that Franklin requests a loan under the Five-Year Credit Agreement. The Five-Year Credit Agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type and substantially similar to the prior financing arrangements, including, among other things, limits on the incurrence of additional debts and liens, a minimum limit on the ratio of earnings to interest expense, a maximum limit on the ratio of debt in relation to liabilities and capital, and maintenance of a minimum level of working capital. The Five-Year Credit Agreement includes customary events of default for facilities of this type (with customary grace periods, as applicable) and provides that, upon the occurrence of an event of default, payment of all outstanding loans under the Five-Year Credit Agreement may be accelerated and/or the lenders' commitments may be terminated. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts payable under the Five-Year Credit Agreement automatically become immediately due and payable, and the lenders' commitments automatically terminate.
Some of the Bank Parties have or may have had various relationships with the Company and its affiliates involving the provision of a variety of financial services, including cash management, investment banking, and the issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees. In addition, the Company and certain affiliates have entered into interest rate and foreign exchange derivative arrangements with some of the financial institutions. The foregoing does not constitute a complete summary of the terms of the Five-Year Credit Agreement, and reference is made to the complete text of the agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 ITEM 1.02 TERMINATION OF A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

If all or a portion of the principal amount of any Bid Loan shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue principal amount shall, without limiting any rights of any Bank under this Agreement, bear interest from the date on which such payment was due at a rate per annum which is 2% above the rate which would otherwise be applicable pursuant to such Bid Loan until the scheduled maturity date with respect thereto, and for each day thereafter at a rate per annum which is 2% above the Alternate Base Rate until paid in full (as well after as before judgment). Interest accruing pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be payable on demand. 2.4 REPAYMENT OF LOANS; EVIDENCE OF DEBT. (a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank the - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20 then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Credit Loan on the Termination Date (or any earlier date on which, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such payment shall become due and payable, by acceleration or otherwise) and (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each relevant Bid Loan Bank the then unpaid principal amount of each Bid Loan on the maturity date for such Loan (such maturity date being that specified by the Borrower for the repayment of such Bid Loan in the related Bid Loan Request). (b) Each Bank shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Bank resulting from each Loan made by such Bank, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Bank from time to time hereunder. (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, whether such Loan is a Revolving Credit Loan or a Bid Loan, the Type thereof and the Interest Period or, in the case of Bid Loans, the maturity date applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Bank hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Banks and each Bank's share thereof. (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be PRIMA FACIE evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; PROVIDED that the failure of any Bank or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall provide such back-up information and supporting documentation that is reasonably requested by the Borrower from time to time to support entries made in said accounts. (e) Any Bank may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Administrative Agent shall prepare and the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Bank, a promissory note payable to the order of such Bank (or, if requested by such Bank, to such Bank and its registered assigns) substantially in the form of Exhibit E-1, in the case of Revolving Loans (a "REVOLVING CREDIT NOTE"), or Exhibit E-2, in the case of any Bid Loans (a "GRID BID LOAN NOTE"); PROVIDED that any Bid Loan Bank may request that any individual Bid Loan (or portion thereof) made by it in an amount of at least $5,000,000 be evidenced by an individual note in the form of Exhibit E-3 (an "INDIVIDUAL BID LOAN NOTE"). Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to subsection 9.6) be represented by one or more promissory notes in substantially such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns). 2.5 OPTIONAL TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS. The Borrower shall have the right, upon not less than five Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent, to terminate the Commitments or, from time to time, to reduce the amount of the Commitments, PROVIDED that no such reduction or termination shall be permitted if, after giving effect thereto, and to any prepayment of the Revolving Credit Loans made on the effective date therein, the - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21 then outstanding principal amount of Loans (including, without limitation, Bid Loans) would exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments as so reduced. Any such reduction shall be in an amount equal to $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and shall reduce permanently the Commitments then in effect. 2.6 OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS. Subject to subsection 2.17, the Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, prepay the Revolving Credit Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, upon at least four Business Days' irrevocable notice from the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, specifying the date and amount of prepayment and whether the prepayment is of LIBOR Loans, Alternate Base Rate Loans or a combination thereof, and, if of a combination thereof, the amount allocable to each. Upon receipt of any such notice from the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof. If any such notice is given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable by the Borrower on the date specified therein, together with accrued interest to such date on the amount prepaid. Partial prepayments shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple thereof and may only be made, if after giving effect thereto, subsection 2.9 shall not have been contravened. The Borrower shall not have the right to prepay the principal amount of any Bid Loan. 2.7 MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS. (a) Upon receipt by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of any Net Proceeds with respect to an Asset Disposition, (i) if such Net Proceeds exceed $10,000,000 or (ii) if such Net Proceeds do not exceed $10,000,000 but such Net Proceeds, together with all other Net Proceeds from other, prior Asset Dispositions in the same fiscal year of the Borrower, which, in each case, have not exceeded $10,000,000, exceed $25,000,000, then on the first Business Day after the receipt of Net Proceeds from such Asset Disposition, the Revolving Credit Loans shall be prepaid, without an accompanying reduction of the Commitments, in an amount equal to 100% of such Net Proceeds (or, in the case of Net Proceeds described in clause (ii) of this paragraph (a), if less, the amount by which such Net Proceeds, together with such other Net Proceeds, exceed $25,000,000). (b) In the event of any Change in Control, if the Majority Banks give the Borrower a notice within 30 days of the announcement of such Change in Control requiring the Borrower to prepay the Loans in full, then the Borrower shall prepay the Loans in full on a date determined by the Borrower and notified by the Borrower pursuant to the procedures of subsection 2.6 which is not more than 90 days after such Change in Control. If the Loans are required to be prepaid in full pursuant to this subsection 2.7(b), such Loans shall not be permitted to be reborrowed and the Commitments shall be deemed to be terminated as of the date of such prepayment. (c) If, after giving effect to any termination or reduction of any Commitments pursuant to subsection 2.5 or this subsection 2.7, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Loans exceeds the aggregate amount of such Commitments then in effect, the Borrower shall pay or prepay such Loans (including, without limitation, the Bid Loans) on the date of such termination or reduction in an aggregate principal amount at least equal to such excess, together with interest thereon accrued to the date of such payment or prepayment. All prepayments made pursuant to this subsection 2.7(c) shall be applied first to the Revolving Credit Loans until such Loans are paid in full and second to the Bid Loans. - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22 (d) Each prepayment of the Loans pursuant to this subsection 2.7 shall be accompanied by payment in full of all accrued interest thereon to and including the date of such prepayment, together with any additional amounts owing pursuant to subsection 2.17. 2.8 CONVERSION AND CONTINUATION OPTIONS. (a) The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert LIBOR Loans to Alternate Base Rate Loans, by giving the Administrative Agent at least two Business Days' prior irrevocable notice of such election, provided that any such conversion of LIBOR Loans may only be made on the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert Alternate Base Rate Loans to LIBOR Loans by giving the Administrative Agent at least three Working Days' prior irrevocable notice of such election. Any such notice of conversion to LIBOR Loans shall specify the length of the initial Interest Period or Interest Periods therefor. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof. All or any part of outstanding LIBOR Loans and Alternate Base Rate Loans may be converted as provided herein, provided that (i) any such conversion may only be made if, after giving effect thereto, subsection 2.9 shall not have been contravened and (ii) no Revolving Credit Loan may be converted into a LIBOR Loan after the date that is one month prior to the Termination Date. (b) Any LIBOR Loans may be continued as such upon the expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the Borrower giving notice to the Administrative Agent, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the term "Interest Period" set forth in subsection 1.1, of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such LIBOR Loans, PROVIDED that no LIBOR Loan may be continued as such (i) if, after giving effect thereto, subsection 2.9 would be contravened or (ii) after the date that is one month prior to the Termination Date and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if the Borrower shall fail to give any required notice as described above in this paragraph or if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the preceding proviso such Revolving Credit Loans shall be automatically converted to Alternate Base Rate Loans on the last day of such then expiring Interest Period. 2.9 MINIMUM AMOUNTS OF TRANCHES. All borrowings, conversions and continuations of Revolving Credit Loans hereunder and all selections of Interest Periods hereunder shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans comprising each Tranche shall be equal to $15,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. 2.10 INTEREST RATES AND PAYMENT DATES. (a) Each LIBOR Loan shall bear interest for each day during each Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR Adjusted Rate determined for such day plus the Applicable Margin. (b) Each Alternate Base Rate Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin. (c) Each Bid Loan shall bear interest as provided in subsection 2.3. (d) If all or a portion of the principal amount of any Revolving Credit Loan or any interest payable on the Loans shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23 acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum which is (x) in the case of overdue principal to the last day of any Interest Period then applicable thereto, the rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this subsection plus 2% or (y) otherwise, the rate described in paragraph (b) of this subsection plus 2%, in each case from the date of such non-payment until such amount is paid in full (as well after as before judgment). (e) Interest on each LIBOR Loan and Alternate Base Rate Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, provided in each case that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (d) of this subsection shall be payable on demand. 2.11 COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES. (a) Interest on Alternate Base Rate Loans, facility fees and utilization fees shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed, PROVIDED that interest on Alternate Base Rate Loans the rate of interest on which are based on the Prime Rate shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed. Interest on LIBOR Loans and Bid Loans shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the Banks of each determination of a LIBOR Adjusted Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the Alternate Base Rate or the LIBOR Reserve Requirements shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change in the Alternate Base Rate is announced or such change in the LIBOR Reserve Requirements becomes effective, as the case may be. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the Banks of the effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate. (b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Banks in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to subsection 2.10(a) and the calculations made by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to subsection 2.10(b). (c) If any Reference Bank's Commitment shall terminate or all its Loans shall be assigned for any reason whatsoever, such Reference Bank shall thereupon cease to be a Reference Bank, and if, as a result of the foregoing, there shall only be one Reference Bank remaining, the Administrative Agent (after consultation with the Borrower and the Banks) shall, by notice to the Borrower and the Banks, designate another Bank as a Reference Bank so that there shall at all times be at least two Reference Banks. (d) Each Reference Bank shall use its best efforts to furnish quotations of rates to the Administrative Agent as contemplated hereby. If any of the Reference Banks shall be unable or shall otherwise fail to supply such rates to the Administrative Agent upon its request, the rate of interest shall, subject to the provisions of subsection 2.12, be determined on the basis of the quotations of the remaining Reference Banks or Reference Bank. - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
24 2.12 INABILITY TO DETERMINE INTEREST RATE. In the event that prior to the first day of any Interest Period: (a) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBOR Adjusted Rate for such Interest Period, or (b) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Majority Banks that the LIBOR Adjusted Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks (as conclusively certified by such Banks) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall give telex, telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the Borrower and the Banks as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given (x) any LIBOR Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as Alternate Base Rate Loans, (y) any Revolving Credit Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to LIBOR Loans shall be converted to or continued as Alternate Base Rate Loans and (z) any outstanding LIBOR Loans shall be converted, on the first day of such Interest Period, to Alternate Base Rate Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further LIBOR Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert Alternate Base Rate Loans to LIBOR Loans. 2.13 PRO RATA TREATMENT AND PAYMENTS. Each borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans by the Borrower from the Banks hereunder, each payment by the Borrower of any facility, utilization or other fee hereunder, and any reduction of the Commitments of the Banks shall be made pro rata according to the respective Commitment Percentages of the Banks. Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the Revolving Credit Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Revolving Credit Loans then held by the Banks. All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower hereunder and under the Notes, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without set off or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the appropriate Banks, at the Administrative Agent's office specified in subsection 9.2, in Dollars and in immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to such Banks promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the LIBOR Loans or LIBOR Bid Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. If any payment on a LIBOR Loan or LIBOR Bid Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Working Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Working Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Working Day. 2.14 ILLEGALITY. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof shall make it unlawful for - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
25 any Bank or Lending Office to make or maintain LIBOR Loans as contemplated by this Agreement, (a) the commitment of such Bank hereunder to make LIBOR Loans, continue LIBOR Loans as such and convert Alternate Base Rate Loans to LIBOR Loans shall forthwith be cancelled and (b) the Loans of such Bank or Lending Office then outstanding as LIBOR Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to Alternate Base Rate Loans on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to such Loans or within such earlier period as required by law. If any such conversion of a LIBOR Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to subsection 2.17. 2.15 REQUIREMENTS OF LAW. (a) In the event that any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Bank with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law but, if not having the force of law, generally applicable to and complied with by banks of the same general type as such Bank in the relevant jurisdiction) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the Effective Date: (i) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Bank or Lending Office which is not otherwise included in the determination of the LIBOR Adjusted Rate hereunder; or (ii) shall impose on such Bank or Lending Office any other condition; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank or Lending Office, by an amount which such Bank deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining LIBOR Loans or Bid Loans or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Bank or Lending Office, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable. If any Bank or any Lending Office becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this subsection, it shall promptly notify the Borrower, through the Administrative Agent, of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this subsection submitted by such Bank or Lending Office, through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower shall be PRIMA FACIE evidence of the accuracy of the information so recorded. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder for one year. (b) If, after the date of this Agreement, the introduction of any applicable law, rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, affects the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by any Bank or any corporation controlling any Bank, and such Bank or such corporation (taking into consideration such Bank's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) determines that the amount of capital maintained by such Bank or such corporation which is attributable to or based upon the Loans, the Commitments or this - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
26 Agreement must be increased as a consequence of such introduction or change, then, upon demand of the Administrative Agent at the request of such Bank, the Borrower shall immediately pay to the Administrative Agent on behalf of such Bank, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank or such corporation for the increased costs to such Bank or corporation of such increased capital. Any such demand shall be accompanied by a certificate of such Bank setting forth in reasonable detail the computation of any such increased costs. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder for one year. (c) Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower, through the Administrative Agent, of any event of which it has knowledge that will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to subsection 2.15(a) or (b) above. No failure by any Bank to give (or delay in giving) such notice shall adversely affect such Bank's rights to such compensation, except that the Borrower shall have no obligation to compensate any Bank for any cost or reduction incurred or accrued by it more than one year before such Bank gives notice of the event giving rise to such cost or reduction as required by the preceding sentence. 2.16 TAXES. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any Note shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; PROVIDED that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this subsection) the Administrative Agent or Bank receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent or such Bank, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
27 (e) Each Foreign Bank hereby agrees that it shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower: (i) two copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8-BEN or Form W-8-ECI (or appropriate successor form), properly completed and duly executed by such Foreign Bank claiming complete exemption from U.S. Federal withholding tax on payments by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (ii) any other documentation as may be required under applicable U.S. tax law and regulations to evidence complete exemption from U.S. Federal withholding tax on all payments by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the Loan Documents. Such forms and other documentation shall be delivered by each Foreign Bank on or before the Initial Date (as defined below) and on or before the date, if any, such Foreign Bank changes its applicable Lending Office by designating a different Lending Office or selecting an additional office. In addition, each Foreign Bank shall deliver appropriate replacements to such forms previously delivered by it promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form or other documentation previously delivered by such Foreign Bank unless an event beyond the control of such Foreign Bank (including, without limitation, any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Foreign Bank from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Foreign Bank so advises the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. (f) For purposes of subsection (e), the term "Initial Date" shall mean (i) with respect to each Foreign Bank that is a party hereto on the date hereof, the date hereof, (ii) with respect to each Participant, the effective date of the grant of a participation to such Participant, and (ii) with respect to each transferee, the date of such transfer or assignment of an interest hereunder to such transferee. 2.17 INDEMNITY. The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Bank and to hold each Bank harmless from any loss or expense which such Bank may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in payment when due of the principal amount of or interest on any LIBOR Loan or Bid Loan, (b) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Bid Loans or LIBOR Loans after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement (and, in the case of Bid Loans, so long as the Borrower has accepted a Bid Loan offered in connection with any such notice), (c) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (d) the making by the Borrower of a prepayment of LIBOR Loans or (without prejudice to the last sentence of subsection 2.3(c)) Bid Loans on a day which is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto, including, without limitation, in each case, any such loss or expense arising from the reemployment of funds obtained by it or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder for one year. - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
28 2.18 FACILITY AND UTILIZATION FEES. (a) During the Commitment Period, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank a facility fee equal to the product of (i) 0.065% per annum at any time the Applicable Margin is based on Rating 1, (ii) 0.075% per annum at any time the Applicable Margin is based on Rating 2, (iii) 0.090% per annum at any time the Applicable Margin is based on Rating 3, (iv) 0.100% at any time the Applicable Margin is based on Rating 4 or (v) 0.125% at any time the Applicable Margin is based on Rating 5, and the average Commitment of such Bank (without regard to the principal amount of Loans from time to time made by such Bank) during the quarter in which the facility fee is paid. Such facility fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December, commencing June 30, 2005 and on the Termination Date (or, in any case, any earlier date on which all amounts outstanding hereunder shall become due and payable by acceleration or otherwise). (b) During the Commitment Period, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank a utilization fee computed at the rate of 0.05% per annum on the aggregate average amount of the Revolving Credit Loans under this Agreement outstanding during the quarter for which such fee is to be paid; PROVIDED, that no such fee shall be required to be paid with respect to any quarter in which the aggregate average amount of the Revolving Credit Loans and Bid Loans then outstanding under this Agreement does not exceed 50% of the aggregate Commitments of the Banks under this Agreement. Such utilization fee, to the extent payable, shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December, commencing on June 30, 2005 and on the Termination Date (or, in any case, any earlier date on which all amounts outstanding hereunder shall become due and payable by acceleration or otherwise). Sample computations of the facility fee and the utilization fee are given in Schedule II hereto. 2.19 MITIGATION OF COSTS. (a) . If any Bank, by changing its Lending Office or taking any other reasonable action, so long as making such change or taking such other action is not, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, disadvantageous to it in any financial, regulatory or other respect, can mitigate any adverse effect on the Borrower under subsections 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, such Bank shall take such action. SECTION 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES To induce the Banks to enter into this Agreement, and to make the Loans the Borrower hereby represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and each Bank that: 3.1 FINANCIAL CONDITION. (a) The consolidated balance sheets of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at September 30, 2003, and September 30, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income and of cash flows for the fiscal year ended on such date, reported on by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, copies of which have heretofore been furnished to each Bank, present fairly the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at such dates, and the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the fiscal year then ended. The unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at March 31, 2005 and the related - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
29 unaudited consolidated statements of income and of cash flows for the six-month period ended on such date, certified to the best of their knowledge by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower, copies of which have heretofore been furnished to each Bank, present fairly the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at such date, and the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the six-month period then ended (subject to normal year-end audit adjustments). All such financial statements, including the related schedules and notes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently throughout the periods involved (except as approved by such accountants or Responsible Officer, as the case may be, and as disclosed therein). Neither the Borrower nor any of its consolidated Subsidiaries had, at the date of the most recent balance sheet referred to above, any material Guarantee Obligation, contingent liability or liability for taxes, or any long-term lease or unusual forward or long-term commitment, including, without limitation, any interest rate or foreign currency swap or exchange transaction, which is not reflected in the foregoing statements or in the notes thereto and which is material in relation to the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries at such date. During the period from March 31, 2005 to and including the Closing Date there has been no sale, transfer or other disposition by the Borrower or any of its consolidated Subsidiaries of any material part of its business or property and no purchase or other acquisition of any business or property (including any capital stock of any other Person) material in relation to the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries at March 31, 2005. 3.2 NO CHANGE. Since March 31, 2005 there has been no Material Adverse Effect. 3.3 CORPORATE EXISTENCE; COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has the corporate power and authority, and the legal right, to own and operate its property, to lease the property it operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it is currently engaged and in which it proposes to be engaged after the Closing Date, (c) is duly qualified as a foreign corporation and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification and (d) is in compliance with all Requirements of Law except to the extent that the failure to comply therewith could not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 3.4 CORPORATE POWER; AUTHORIZATION; ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS. The Borrower has the corporate power and authority, and the legal right, to make, deliver and perform the Loan Documents and to borrow hereunder and has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize (i) the borrowings on the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Notes and (ii) the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents. Except as set forth on Schedule III hereto, no consent or authorization of, filing with or other act by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required in connection with the borrowings hereunder or with the execution, delivery, performance, validity or enforceability of this Agreement or the Notes. This Agreement has been, and each of the Notes will be, duly executed and delivered. This Agreement constitutes, and each of the Notes when executed and delivered will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any assignment or transfer by a Bank of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection 9.6 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Bank of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section. (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Bank pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of demonstrable error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Banks may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Bank hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Bank, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Bank and an assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Bank hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall promptly accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
54 therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph. (c) (i) Any Bank may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "PARTICIPANT") in all or a portion of such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); PROVIDED that (A) such Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Banks shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Bank sells such a participation shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; PROVIDED that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Bank will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in clause (a) or (b) of subsection 9.1 that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this subsection, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of subsections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a Bank and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of subsection 9.7(b) as though it were a Bank, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to subsection 9.7(a) as though it were a Bank. (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under subsection 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17 than the applicable Bank would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. Subject to the preceding sentence, a Participant that would be a Foreign Bank if it were a Bank shall not be entitled to the benefits of subsection 2.16 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with subsection 2.16(e) as though it were a Bank and for purposes of claiming any benefit under subsection 2.16, any reference to a Foreign Bank shall be deemed to refer to such Participant. (d) Any Bank may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including any Note) to secure obligations of such Bank, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; PROVIDED that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Bank from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Bank as a party hereto. 9.7 ADJUSTMENTS; SET-OFF. (a) If any Bank (a "BENEFITTED BANK") shall at any time receive any payment of all or part of its Loans, or interest thereon, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in subsection 7(g), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other Bank, if any, in respect of such other Bank's Loans, or interest thereon, such Benefitted Bank shall purchase for cash from the - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
55 other Banks such portion of each such other Bank's Loans, or shall provide such other Banks with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such Benefitted Bank to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the Banks; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such Benefitted Bank, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. The Borrower agrees that each Bank so purchasing a portion of another Bank's Loan may exercise all rights of payment (including, without limitation, rights of set-off) with respect to such portion as fully as if such Bank were the direct holder of such portion. (b) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Banks provided by law, each Bank shall have the right, exercisable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and acceleration of the obligations of the Borrower owing in connection with this Agreement, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, to set-off and appropriate and apply against any such obligations any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Bank or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower (except for any such deposits, credits, indebtedness or claims held in any accounts maintained at any Bank as to which such Bank has waived its right of set-off). Each Bank agrees promptly to notify the Borrower, and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Bank, PROVIDED that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. 9.8 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. 9.9 SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. 9.10 INTEGRATION.
