ITEM 5.02 DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR PRINCIPAL OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF PRINCIPAL OFFICERS. (d) On June 23, 2005, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") elected Ms. Laura Stein to fill one newly created vacancy on the Board resulting from the Board's increase in the authorized number of directors of the Company from eleven (11) directors to twelve (12) directors, as described in Item 5.03 below. Ms. Stein is not, and has not been, an employee of the Company. The Board affirmatively determined that Ms. Stein was "independent" under the Company's Director Independence Standards, as amended, and the independence requirements for directors and members of an audit committee pursuant to both the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual and the rules for listed companies on the Pacific Exchange, Inc. as well as the independence requirements for audit committee members promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, the Board also appointed Ms. Stein to the Audit Committee of the Board on June 23, 2005. As a non-employee director on the Board with no other relationship with the Company and its affiliates other than her prospective service to the Company as a non-employee director, Ms. Stein will receive the same standard compensation amounts paid to other non-employee directors for service on the Board, which amounts have been disclosed previously in the Company's Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on December 23, 2004. There were no arrangements or understandings between Ms. Stein and any other person pursuant to which she was elected as a director, and there are and have been no transactions since the beginning of the Company's last fiscal year, or currently proposed, regarding Ms. Stein that are required to be disclosed by Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K, except as described above. ITEM 5.03 AMENDMENTS TO ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION OR BYLAWS; CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR.

actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify against any amount paid in settlement unless the Corporation has consented to such settlement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement or conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that such person had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.1, a person shall not be entitled, as a matter of right, to indemnification pursuant to this Section 4.1 against costs or expenses incurred in connection with any action, suit or proceeding commenced by such person against any person who is or was a director, officer, fiduciary, employee or agent of the Corporation or a Subsidiary Officer of any Affiliated Entity, but such indemnification may be provided by the Corporation in a specific case as permitted by Section 4.6 of this Article. Section 4.2 INDEMNIFICATION RESPECTING DERIVATIVE CLAIMS. The Corporation, to the full extent permitted, and in the manner required, by the laws of the State of Delaware as in effect at the time of the adoption of this Article or as such laws may be amended from time to time, shall indemnify any person who was or is made a party to or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit (including any appeal thereof) brought in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of, or to represent the interests of, the Corporation as a Subsidiary Officer of an Affiliated Entity against expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements) and costs actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless, and except to the extent that, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such judgment was rendered shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses and costs as the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.2, a person shall not be entitled, as a matter of right, to indemnification pursuant to this Section 4.2 against costs and expenses incurred in connection with any action or suit in the right of the Corporation commenced by such person, but such indemnification may be provided by the Corporation in any specific case as permitted by Section 4.6 of this Article. 7 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 4.3 DETERMINATION OF ENTITLEMENT TO INDEMNIFICATION. Any indemnification under Section 4.1 or 4.2 of this Article (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director, officer, employee or agent is proper under the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in, Section 4.1 or 4.2 of this Article. Such determination shall be made with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination (i) by a majority vote of the Board of Directors who were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum or (ii) by a committee of such directors (each of whom is not a party to such action, suit or proceeding) designated by majority vote of the Board of Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors or if the disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iv) by the stockholders. In the event a request for indemnification is made by any person referred to in Section 4.1 or Section 4.2 of this Article, the Corporation shall cause such determination to be made not later than 60 days after such request is made. Section 4.4 RIGHT TO INDEMNIFICATION UPON SUCCESSFUL DEFENSE AND FOR SERVICE AS WITNESS. (a) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article, to the extent that a present or former director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Section 4.1 or 4.2 of this Article, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements) and costs actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith. (b) To the extent any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation has served or prepared to serve as a witness in any action, suit or proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative in nature) or in any investigation by the Corporation or the Board of Directors thereof or committee thereof or by any securities exchange on which securities of the Corporation are or were listed by reason of his services as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or as a Subsidiary Officer of any Affiliated Entity (other than in a suit commenced by such person), the Corporation shall indemnify such person against expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements) and costs actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith within 30 days after receipt by the Corporation from such person of a statement requesting such indemnification, averring such service and reasonably evidencing such expenses and costs. Section 4.5 ADVANCE OF EXPENSES. Expenses (including attorneys' fees) and costs incurred by an officer of director of the Corporation in defending a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized by this Article. Such expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by other 8 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
former directors and officers employees or agents of the Corporation may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the corporation deems appropriate. Section 4.6 INDEMNIFICATION NOT EXCLUSIVE. The provision of indemnification to, or the advancement of expenses and costs to, any person under this Article, or the entitlement of any person to indemnification or advancement of expenses and costs under this Article, shall not limit or restrict in any way the power of the Corporation to indemnify or advance expenses and costs to such person in any other way permitted by law or be deemed exclusive of, or invalidate, any right to which any person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses and costs may be entitled under any law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person's capacity as an officer, director, employee or agent of the Corporation and as to action to any other capacity while holding any such position. Section 4.7 ACCRUAL OF CLAIMS; SUCCESSORS. The indemnification provided or permitted under this Article shall apply in respect of any expense, cost, judgment, fine, penalty or amount paid in settlement, whether or not the claim or cause of action in respect thereof accrued or arose before or after the effective date of this Article. The right of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation to indemnification under this Article shall continue after he shall have ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, distributes, executors, administrators and other legal representatives of such person. Section 4.8 CORPORATE OBLIGATIONS; RELIANCE. This Article shall be deemed to create a binding obligation on the part of the Corporation to its current and former officers, directors, employees and agents and their heirs, distributes, executors, administrators and other legal representatives, and such persons in acting in such capacities shall be entitled to rely on the provisions of this Article, without giving notice thereof to the Corporation.

Section 4.10 DEFINITIONS OF CERTAIN TERMS. (a) For purposes of this Article, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its corporate existence had continued, would have been permitted under applicable law to indemnify its directors, officers employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request, or to represent the interests of, such 9 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
