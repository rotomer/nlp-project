Class Z shares are offered to qualified investors only and have no sales charges or Rule 12b-1 fees. Franklin Templeton funds are compared against a universe of all share classes. All Franklin Templeton Class A (Class Z) asset data is based on 5/31/05 figures unless noted otherwise. Indices are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in them. Unless otherwise noted, fund returns quoted reflect Class A shares. Performance returns, ratings and rankings for other classes may vary. 3. LIPPER calculates averages by taking all the funds and share classes in a peer group and averaging their total returns for the periods indicated. LIPPER tracks 143 peer groups of U.S. retail mutual funds, and the groups vary in size from 4 to 939 funds. LIPPER total return calculations include reinvested dividends and capital gains, but do not include sales charges or expense subsidization by the manager. Results may have been different if these or other factors had been considered. 4. Source: LIPPER(R) Inc., 6/30/05.

Source: LIPPER(R) Inc., 6/30/05. A LIPPER LEADER DISTINCTION DOES NOT IMPLY THAT A FUND NAMED AS A LIPPER LEADER HAD THE BEST PERFORMANCE IN ITS CATEGORY. LIPPER Leaders Awards are based on Class A shares. LIPPER ratings for Consistent Return reflect funds' historical risk-adjusted returns, adjusted for volatility, relative to peers. LIPPER ratings for Total Return reflect funds' historical total return performance relative to peers. LIPPER ratings for Preservation reflect funds' historical loss avoidance relative to other funds within the same asset class. Preservation ratings are relative, rather than absolute, measures, and funds named LIPPER Leaders for Preservation may still experience losses periodically; those losses may be larger for equity and mixed equity funds than for fixed income funds. LIPPER ratings for Tax Efficiency reflect funds' historical success in postponing taxable distributions relative to peers. THE LIPPER RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE EVERY MONTH AND ARE BASED ON AN EQUAL-WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF PERCENTILE RANKS FOR THE CONSISTENT RETURN, TOTAL RETURN, PRESERVATION AND TAX-EFFICIENCY METRICS OVER THREE-, FIVE- AND 10-YEAR PERIODS (IF APPLICABLE). 20% of funds in each peer group are named LIPPER Leaders, the next 20% receive a score of 2, the middle 20% are scored 3, the next 20% are scored 4 and the lowest 20% are scored 5. Bracketed information represents the number of funds in each category. Not Available indicates that there were not enough funds in a category to constitute a class. FRANKLIN INCOME FUND, in LIPPER'S Income classification, received the following ratings for the three-, five- and 10-year periods respectively: Total Return: LIPPER Leader [140], LIPPER Leader [93], LIPPER Leader [25]; Preservation (in Mixed Equity asset class): 2 [1008], LIPPER Leader [764], LIPPER Leader [335]; Consistent Return: LIPPER Leader [150], LIPPER Leader [93], 2 [19].

For each fund with at least a three-year history, MORNINGSTAR calculates a MORNINGSTAR Rating based on a MORNINGSTAR Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

* Our ability to meet cash needs depends upon certain factors, including our asset value, credit worthiness and the market value of our stock. * Certain of the portfolios we manage, including our emerging market portfolios, are vulnerable to market-specific political, economic or other risks, any of which may negatively impact our revenues and income. * Our revenues, earnings and income could be adversely affected if the terms of our investment management agreements are significantly altered or these agreements are terminated by the funds we advise. * Diverse and strong competition limits the interest rates that we can charge on consumer loans. * We are subject to extensive regulation domestically and abroad. * Regulatory or legislative actions and reforms, particularly those specifically focused on the mutual fund industry, could adversely impact our assets under management, increase costs and negatively impact our profitability and future financial results. * Civil litigation arising out of or relating to recently settled governmental investigations or other matters as well as the legal risks associated with our business could adversely impact our assets under management, increase costs and negatively impact our profitability and/or our future financial results. * We depend on key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services. # # # -13-
