Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
As of September 28, 2005, Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") and Samuel H. Armacost, a director of the Company, entered into an Indemnification Agreement. It is the Company's policy to enter into indemnification agreements ("Indemnification Agreements") with its directors, some of whom are also executive officers (each, an "Indemnified Person"). The Indemnification Agreements generally provide for (i) if requested by the Indemnified Person, the advancing of attorneys' fees and all other costs, expenses and obligations paid or incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in, or preparing to defend, be a witness in or participate in, any Claim ("Expenses") and (ii) indemnification of an Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted by law against any and all Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement of such Claim.
 
A "Claim" consists of participation in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, or any inquiry or investigation that the Indemnified Person in good faith believes might lead to the institution of any such action, suit or proceeding and must be related to the fact that the Indemnified Person is or was a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, trustee, agent or fiduciary for another corporation, partnership, join venture, employee benefit plan, trust or other enterprise.
 
Additionally, the Indemnification Agreements provide that if the Company pays an Indemnified Person pursuant to the Indemnification Agreements, the Company will be subrogated to the Indemnified Person's rights to recover from third parties.
 
However, the Indemnification Agreements prohibit such indemnification (i) in connection with any Claim initiated by the Indemnified Person against the Company or any director or officer of the Company unless the Company has joined in or consented to the Claim or (ii) if selected members of the Board of Directors or other person or body appointed by the Board of Directors determines that such indemnification is not permitted under applicable law. In the event of such determination, the Indemnified Person agrees to reimburse the Company for all amounts that the Company has advanced to the Indemnified Person in respect of such indemnification.
 
The Indemnification Agreements also provide that if there is a change in control of the Company, the Company will seek legal advice from special, independent counsel selected by the Indemnified Person and approved by the Company with respect to matters thereafter arising concerning rights of the Indemnified Person under the Indemnification Agreement. Additionally, the Indemnification Agreements provide that if there is a potential change in control, the Company will, upon written request of the Indemnified Person, fund a trust to satisfy expenses reasonably anticipated to be incurred in connection with a Claim relating to an indemnifiable event.
 
This brief description of the Indemnification Agreements is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form of Indemnification Agreements, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 10.1
 
INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT
 
THIS INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made as of this __ day of _____, 200_ by and between Franklin Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company" or "Indemnitor"), and (the "Indemnitee").
 
WITNESSETH:
 
WHEREAS, it is essential to the Company to retain and attract as directors and officers the most capable persons available;
 
WHEREAS, Indemnitee is a director or officer of the Company;
 
WHEREAS, both the Company and Indemnitee recognize the increased risk of litigation and other claims being asserted against directors and officers of public companies in today's environment;
 
WHEREAS, while basic protection against undue risk of personal liability of directors and officers heretofore has been provided through insurance coverage, such insurance may not provide adequate protection against such litigation and claims;
 
WHEREAS, the Certificate of Incorporation and by-laws of the Company, as amended, require the Company to indemnify its directors and officers as provided therein and Indemnitee has been serving and continues to serve as a director or officer of the Company in part in reliance on such Certificate of Incorporation and by-laws;
 
WHEREAS, in recognition of Indemnitee's need for substantial protection against personal liability in order to enhance Indemnitee's continued service to the Company in an effective manner, and Indemnitee's reliance on the aforesaid Certificate of Incorporation and by-laws, and in part to provide Indemnitee with specific contractual assurance that the protection specified in the Certificate of Incorporation and by-laws, as amended, will be available to Indemnitee (regardless of, among other things, any amendment to or revocation of such Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws, any change in the composition of the Company's Board of Directors or any acquisition transaction relating to the Company), the Company wishes to provide in this Agreement for the indemnification of and the advancing of expenses to Indemnitee to the full extent (whether partial or complete) permitted by law and as set forth in this Agreement, and, to the extent insurance is maintained, for the continued coverage of Indemnitee under the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policies;
 
 
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of Indemnitee continuing to serve the Company directly or, at its request, with another enterprise, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:
 
 
(a)
            
Change in Control
shall be deemed to have occurred if (i) any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Act")), other than a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or a corporation owned directly or indirectly by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company, is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 20% or more of the total voting power represented by the Company's then outstanding Voting Securities, except (A) a person who as of the date hereof owns 20% or more of the total voting power represented by the Company's outstanding Voting Securities (a "20% Group") shall not be deemed to have caused a change in control until such person becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the then outstanding Voting Securities, or (B) a person who becomes a beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 20% or more of the total voting power represented by the Company's then outstanding Voting Securities shall not be deemed to have caused a change in control unless such person also owns more of the total voting power represented by the Company's outstanding Voting Securities than is owned by a 20% Group at the time such person becomes owner of such securities, or (ii) during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board of Directors of the Company and any new director whose election by the Board of Directors or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof, or (iii) the stockholders of the Company approve a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the Voting Securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into Voting Securities of the surviving entity) at least 80% of the total voting power represented by the Voting Securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, or the stockholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets.
 
(b)
           
Claim
shall mean any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, or any inquiry or investigation, whether conducted by the Company or any other party, that Indemnitee in good faith believes might lead to the institution of any such action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other.
 
 
 
 
obligations paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to defend, be a witness in or participate in, any Claim relating to any Indemnifiable Event.
 
(d)
           
Indemnifiable Event
shall mean any event or occurrence related to the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, trustee, agent or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or other enterprise, or by reason of anything done or not done by Indemnitee in any such capacity.
 
(e)
            
Potential Change in Control
shall be deemed to have occurred if (i) the Company enters into an agreement, the consummation of which would result in the occurrence of a Change in Control, or (ii) any person (including the Company) publicly announces an intention to take or to consider taking actions which if consummated would constitute a Change in Control, or (iii) any person, other than a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company, who is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 9.5% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding Voting Securities, increases his beneficial ownership of such securities by 5% or more over the percentage so owned by such person on the date hereof, except (A) a 20% Group which increases its beneficial ownership of such securities by 5% or more over the percentage so owned on the date hereof shall not be deemed to have caused a potential change in control, unless such increase results in such person becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the then outstanding Voting Securities, or (B) a person who is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of the voting power representing 9.5% or more of the Company's Voting Securities and increases his beneficial ownership of such securities by 5% or more over the percentage so owned by such person on the date hereof shall not be deemed to have caused a potential change in control to have occurred unless, including such increase in ownership, such person owns more of the voting power represented by the Company's Voting Securities than is owned by a 20% Group at the time such person increases his ownership, or (iv) the Company's Board of Directors adopts a resolution to the effect that, for purposes of this Agreement, a Potential Change in Control has occurred.
 
(f)
            
Reviewing Party
shall mean any appropriate person or body consisting of a member or members of the Company's Board of Directors or any other person or body appointed by the Company's Board of Directors (including the special, independent counsel referred to in Section 3 hereof) who is not a party to the particular Claim for which Indemnitee is seeking indemnification.
 
(g)
           
Voting Securities
shall mean any securities of the Company which have rights to vote generally in the election of directors.
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a)
            
In the event Indemnitee was, is or becomes a party to or witness or other participant in, or is threatened to be made a party to or witness or other participant in, a Claim by reason of (or arising in part out of) an Indemnifiable Event, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law, as soon as practicable but in any event no later than thirty days after written demand is presented to the Company, against any and all Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement) of such Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Indemnitee shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement in connection with any Claim initiated by Indemnitee against the Company or any director or officer of the Company unless the Company has joined in or consented to the initiation of such Claim. If so requested by Indemnitee, the Company shall advance (within two business days of such request) any and all Expenses to Indemnitee (an "Expense Advance").
 
(b)
           
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the obligations of the Company under Section 2(a) shall be subject to the condition that the Reviewing Party shall not have determined (in a written opinion, in any case in which the special, independent counsel referred to in Section 3 hereof is involved) that Indemnitee would not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law, and (ii) the obligation of the Company to make an Expense Advance pursuant to Section 2(a) shall be subject to the condition that, if, when and to the extent that the Reviewing Party determines that Indemnitee would not be permitted to be so indemnified under applicable law, the Company shall be entitled to be reimbursed by Indemnitee (who hereby agrees to reimburse the Company) for all such amounts theretofore paid; provided, however, that if Indemnitee has commenced legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure a determination that Indemnitee should be indemnified under applicable law, any determination made by the Reviewing Party that Indemnitee would not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law shall not be binding and Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Company for any Expense Advance until the final judicial determination is made with respect thereto (as to which all rights of appeal therefrom have been exhausted or lapsed). If there has not been a Change in Control, the Reviewing Party shall be selected by the Board of Directors, and if there has been such a Change in Control, the Reviewing Party shall be the special, independent counsel referred to in Section 3 hereof. If there has been no determination by the Reviewing Party or if the Reviewing Party determines that Indemnitee substantively would not be permitted to be indemnified in whole or in part under applicable law, Indemnitee shall have the right to commence litigation in any court in the state of domicile or Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction thereof and in which venue is proper seeking an initial determination by the court or challenging any such determination by the Reviewing Party or any aspect thereof, and the Company hereby consents to service of process and to appear in any such proceeding. Any determination by the Reviewing Party otherwise shall be conclusive and binding on the Company and Indemnitee.
 
 
 
 
 
3.
              
Change in Control
. The Company agrees that, if there is a Change in Control of the Company (other than a Change in Control which has been approved by a majority of the Company's Board of Directors who were directors immediately prior to such Change in Control), then with respect to all matters thereafter arising concerning the rights of Indemnitee to indemnity payments and Expense Advances under this Agreement or any other agreement or the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws now or hereafter in effect relating to Claims for Indemnifiable Events, the Company shall seek legal advice only from special, independent counsel selected by Indemnitee and approved by the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), and who has not otherwise performed services for the Company within the last five years (other than in connection with such matters) or Indemnitee. Such counsel, among other things, shall render its written opinion to the Company and Indemnitee as to whether and to what extent Indemnitee would be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law. The Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees of the special, independent counsel referred to above and to fully indemnify such counsel against any and all expenses (including attorneys' fees), claims, liabilities and damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its engagement pursuant hereto.
 
4.
              
Establishment of Trust
. In the event of a Potential Change in Control, the Company shall, upon written request by Indemnitee, create a trust for the benefit of Indemnitee (the "Trust") and from time to time upon written request of Indemnitee shall fund the Trust in an amount sufficient to satisfy any and all Expenses reasonably anticipated at the time of each such request to be incurred in connection with investigating, preparing for and defending any Claim relating to an Indemnifiable Event, and any and all judgments, fines, penalties and settlement amounts of any and all Claims relating to an Indemnifiable Event from time to time actually paid or claimed, reasonably anticipated or proposed to be paid. The amount or amounts to be deposited in the Trust pursuant to the foregoing funding obligation shall be determined by the Reviewing Party, in any case in which the special, independent counsel referred to above is involved. The terms of the Trust shall provide that upon a Change in Control (i) the trustee to the Trust (the "Trustee") shall advance, within two business days of a request by Indemnitee, any and all Expenses to Indemnitee (and Indemnitee hereby agrees to reimburse the Trust under the circumstances under which Indemnitee would be required to reimburse the Company under Section 2(b) of this Agreement), (ii) the Trust shall continue to be funded by the Company in accordance with the funding obligation set forth above, (iii) the Trustee shall promptly pay to Indemnitee all amounts for which Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, and (iv) all unexpended funds in such Trust shall revert to the Company upon a final determination by the Reviewing Party or a court of competent jurisdiction, as the case may be, that Indemnitee has been fully indemnified under the terms of the Agreement, or that it is no longer anticipated that expenses will be incurred or amounts will be paid in connection with the Indemnifiable Event. The Trustee shall be chosen by Indemnitee. Nothing in this Section 4 shall relieve the Company of any of its obligations under this Agreement.
 
5.
              
Indemnification for Additional Expenses
. The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all expenses (including attorneys' fees) and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall (within two business days of such request) advance such expenses to Indemnitee, which are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any claim asserted against or
 
 
 
action brought by Indemnitee for (i) indemnification or advance payment of Expenses by the Company under this Agreement or any other agreement or the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws now or hereafter in effect relating to Claims for Indemnifiable Events and/or (ii) recovery under any directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the Company, regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to such indemnification, expense payment or insurance recovery, as the case may be.
 
6.
              
Partial Indemnity, Etc
. If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of the Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement of a Claim but not, however, for all of the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which Indemnitee is entitled. Moreover, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any or all Claims relating in whole or in part to an Indemnifiable Event or in defense of any issue or matter therein, including dismissal without prejudice, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses incurred in connection therewith. In connection with any determination by the Reviewing Party or otherwise as to whether Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified hereunder the burden of proof shall be on the Company to establish that Indemnitee is not so entitled.
 
7.
              
No Presumption
. For purposes of this Agreement, the termination of any claim, action, suit or proceeding, by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval) or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet any particular standard of conduct or have any particular belief or that a court has determined that indemnification is not permitted by applicable law.
 
8.
              
Non-Exclusivity, Etc
. The rights of Indemnitee hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights Indemnitee may have under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, by-laws or the Delaware General Corporation Law or otherwise. To the extent that a change in the Delaware General Corporation Law (whether by statute or judicial decision) permits greater indemnification by agreement than would be afforded currently under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, by-laws and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change.
 
9.
              
Liability Insurance
. To the extent the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies providing directors' and officers' liability insurance, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies, in accordance with its or their terms, to the maximum extent of the coverage provided under such policy or policies in effect for any other Company director or officer.
 
10.
           
Amendments, Etc
. No supplement, modification or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by both of the parties hereto. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or not similar) nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver.
 
 
 
 
subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the Company effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.
 
12.
           
No Duplication of Payments
. The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment in connection with any claim made against Indemnitee to the extent Indemnitee has otherwise actually received payment (under any insurance policy, Certificate of Incorporation, by-law or otherwise) of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.
 
13.
           
Binding Effect, Etc
. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, including any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company, spouses, heirs, and personal and legal representatives. This Agreement shall continue in effect regardless of whether Indemnitee continues to serve as an officer or director of the Company or in any capacity of any other enterprise at the Company's request.
 
14.
           
Severability
. The provisions of this Agreement shall be severable in the event that any of the provisions hereof (including any provision within a single section, paragraph or sentence) are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable, and the remaining provisions shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.
 
15.
           
Governing Law
. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and to be performed in such state without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date set forth above.
