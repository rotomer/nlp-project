On various dates between October 1, 2005 and December 22, 2005, holders of approximately $341,979,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2031 (Zero Coupon-Senior) (the "LYONs") of Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") converted the LYONs into an aggregate of 3,201,043 shares of its common stock, par value $.10 per share, as described in the table below. There is $529,065,000 in remaining principal amount of LYONs as of December 22, 2005.
 
 
 
As previously reported in a press released attached as exhibit 99.1 to the Company's Form 8-K dated September 16, 2005, commencing October 1, 2005, the LYONs became eligible for conversion into shares of the Company's common stock at a rate of 9.3604 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of LYONs surrendered for conversion. Holders may convert their LYONs into shares of the Company's common stock at any time before 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on December 31, 2005. The LYONs were issued in May 2001.
 
The shares of common stock were issued solely to holders of the LYONs upon conversion of the LYONs pursuant to the exemption from registration provided under Section 3(a)(9) of the
 
 
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which is available since the shares of common stock were exchanged by the Company with its existing security holders exclusively where no commission or other renumeration was paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting such an exchange.
