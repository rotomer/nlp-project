UPDATED AWARD DOCUMENTS FOR RESTRICTED FUND UNIT AWARDS.
Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as exhibits to its Form 8-K, dated November 3, 2005, copies of its forms of Notices of Restricted Fund Unit Award and Restricted Fund Unit Award Agreements (collectively, "Award Documents") with respect to incentive awards paid in shares of investment companies in the Franklin Templeton Investments funds pursuant to the terms of the Company's Amended and Restated Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (the "AIP"), which incentive awards are subject to restrictions and a vesting schedule determined to be appropriate by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company. The Company recently adopted updated forms of its Award Documents and, although the material terms of the Award Documents have not changed, copies of the updated standard forms of a Notice of Restricted Fund Unit Award and Restricted Fund Unit Award Agreement for awards to certain investment management personnel and, potentially, others ("Standard IM Award Documents"), and updated forms of a Notice of Restricted Fund Unit Award and Restricted Fund Unit Award Agreement in the case of awards made to certain other investment management personnel and, potentially, others ("Other IM Award Documents") are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively (collectively, "Updated AIP Award Documents"). The forms of Other IM Award Documents differ from the forms of Standard IM Award Documents with regard to the timing of the vesting of restricted fund units credited as a result of dividends paid from time to time with respect to the shares of the applicable class of a series of an investment company in the Franklin Templeton Investments funds issuable for each restricted fund unit.
The following is a summary of the principal terms of the Updated AIP Award Documents, which is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively:
The Company may issue to participants, including executive officers of the Company (hereinafter, each "Participant"), restricted fund units ("Units") as set forth in the Notice of Restricted Fund Unit Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Participant as owner thereof as set forth in the Restricted Fund Unit Award Agreement.
. The Units may not be transferred by Participant in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Participant may designate a beneficiary of the Units in the event of Participant's death. The terms of the Restricted Fund Unit Award Agreement shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and transferees of Participant.
Transfer Restrictions
. The Units shall become vested in accordance with the vesting schedule in the Notice of Restricted Fund Unit Award so long as Participant maintains a continuous status as an employee of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company. If Participant ceases to maintain a continuous status as an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries for any reason other than death or disability, all Units to the extent not yet vested on the date Participant ceases to be an employee shall be forfeited by Participant. If Participant dies or in the event of termination of Participant's continuous status as an employee as a result of disability (as determined by the Board in accordance with the policies of the Company) while an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, the Units awarded shall become fully vested as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board, "disability" means that Participant ceases to be an employee on account of disability as a result of which Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long-term disability policy.
Vesting
 
In the event of a proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company or of a merger or corporate combination of the Company (a "Transaction") in which the successor entity does not agree to assume the award of restricted fund units or substitute an equivalent award, the Company shall make a determination as to the equitable treatment of the award and shall notify Participant of such treatment no later than ten (10) days prior to the consummation of such proposed Transaction. In the event the award is not assumed in connection with a Transaction, the award will terminate upon the consummation of such proposed Transaction.
. Upon each vesting date, the value of one share of the applicable class of a series of an investment company in the Franklin Templeton Investments funds ("fund") shall be issuable for each Unit that vests on such date (the "Shares"), subject to the terms and provisions of the AIP, the Notice of Restricted Fund Unit Award and the Restricted Fund Unit Award Agreement. Any fractional Unit that vests on a particular date shall be converted into the value of a fractional Share. Thereafter, the Company will transfer to a broker and/or dealer or equivalent entity authorized to effect transactions in such fund shares for the account of others (the "Broker/Dealer") in the jurisdiction of Participant's employment, or cause such Broker/Dealer to receive or otherwise credit, the aggregate vested value of such Shares for the benefit of such Participant. The Broker/Dealer will then cause the Shares to be acquired on behalf of Participant and, thereafter, the Broker/Dealer will transfer such Shares to Participant. Any Shares in a fund shall be advisor class shares or equivalent, if available; otherwise, they shall be Class A shares or equivalent or, if unavailable, the Company shall make a determination as to the class of Shares. Notwithstanding the above, the Company may, in its discretion, pay to Participant all or a portion of any vested Units in cash in an amount equal to the vested value of the Shares. The Shares or equivalent cash payment will be issued to Participant as soon as practicable after the vesting date, but in any event, within the period ending on the later to occur of the date that is two and a half (2

) months from the end of (i) Participant's tax year that includes the applicable vesting date, or (ii) the Company's tax year that includes the applicable vesting date.
In the event any one or more of the funds ceases to exist, the shares of such fund represented by Units subject to the award shall be replaced with shares of a comparable fund in the Franklin Templeton Investments funds which preserves the compensation element of the award existing at the time the fund ceases to exist. The determination of fund comparability shall be made by the Compensation Committee of the Board and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive.
. Participant shall not have any right in, to or with respect to any of the Shares (including any voting rights) issuable under the award until the award is settled by the issuance of such Shares to Participant.
Right To Shares
. Any dividends that are paid from time to time with respect to the Shares represented by the Units shall be deemed reinvested in the Shares with respect to which the dividend was paid and shall be credited to Participant as additional Units. Such additional Units shall vest in accordance with the terms of the applicable Standard IM Award Documents or Other IM Award Documents.

4. .
Conversion of Units and Issuance of Fund Shares

Any fractional Unit that vests on a particular date shall be converted into the value of a fractional Share. Thereafter, the Company will transfer to a broker and/or dealer or equivalent entity authorized to effect transactions in such fund shares for the account of others (the "Broker/Dealer") in the jurisdiction of Participant's employment, or cause such Broker/Dealer to receive or otherwise credit, the aggregate Vested Value (as defined below) of such Shares for the benefit of such Participant. The Broker/Dealer will then cause the Shares to be acquired on behalf of Participant and, thereafter, the Broker/Dealer will transfer such Shares to Participant. Any Shares in a fund shall be advisor class shares or equivalent, if available; otherwise, they shall be Class A shares or equivalent or, if unavailable, the Company shall make a determination as to the class of Shares. Notwithstanding the above, the Company may, in its discretion, pay to Participant all or a portion of any vested Units in cash in an amount equal to the Vested Value of the Shares.

 1
/
2
) months from the end of (i) Participant's tax year that includes the applicable vesting date, or (ii) the Company's tax year that includes the applicable vesting date.
(b) "Vested Value" shall mean: (i) with regard to Shares of closed-end funds, the number of vested Shares multiplied by the closing price per share of the applicable fund on the primary stock exchange or NASDAQ stock market, as applicable, on which such fund then trades on the date the underlying Units vested (or, if such date is not a trading day, on the last trading day prior to such date), less any required tax or other withholding; or (ii) with regard to non-closed end funds, the aggregate Net Asset Value (as defined below) of the Shares on the date the underlying Units vested, less any required tax or other withholding obligations.
 
(c) "Net Asset Value" shall mean the net asset value per share of the applicable non-closed end fund calculated on the date of determination as detailed in the fund's prospectus (or, if the date of determination is not a trading day, on the last trading day prior to the date of determination).
(d) In the event any one or more of the funds set forth in the Notice of Award ceases to exist, the shares of such fund represented by Units subject to the Award shall be replaced with shares of a comparable fund in the Franklin Templeton Investments funds which preserves the compensation element of the Award existing at the time the fund ceases to exist. The determination of fund comparability shall be made by the Committee and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive.
5. .
Right to Shares; Dividends
(a) Except as set forth in paragraph 5(b) of this Agreement, Participant shall not have any right in, to or with respect to any of the Shares (including any voting rights) issuable under the Award until the Award is settled by the issuance of such Shares to Participant.
(b) Any dividends that are paid from time to time with respect to the Shares represented by the Units shall be deemed reinvested in the Shares with respect to which the dividend was paid, shall be credited to Participant as additional Units and shall vest upon the same vesting date (in accordance with the Notice of Award) of the corresponding Units pursuant to which the dividends were originally paid.
6. .
Withholding of Taxes
(a) . Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by Participant in connection with the Units awarded, regardless of any action the Company or any of its subsidiaries takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Units awarded. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of the Units awarded or the subsequent sale of any of the Shares. The Company and its subsidiaries do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the Award to reduce or eliminate Participant's tax liability.
General
(b) . Prior to any event in connection with the Units awarded (e.g., vesting) that the Company determines may result in any tax withholding obligation, whether United States federal, state or local taxes and including any employment tax obligation (the "Tax Withholding Obligation"), Participant must arrange for the satisfaction of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company, including by means of one of the following methods:
Payment of Withholding Taxes
(i) Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (ii) below, Participant authorizes the Company (in the exercise of its sole discretion) to withhold the number of Units sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation, provided that the Company shall withhold only the amount of Units necessary to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Unit withholding will result in issuance of a lower number of Shares or amount of equivalent cash, as applicable, to Participant.
By Unit Withholding.
(ii) . At any time not less than five (5) business days (or such fewer number of days as determined by the Committee or its designee) before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises (, a vesting date), Participant may elect to satisfy the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation by delivering to the Company an amount that
By Check, Wire Transfer or Other Means
e.g.
 
the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation by (x) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (y) delivery of a certified check payable to the Company, or (z) such other means as specified from time to time by the Committee or its designee.
7. . This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. Nothing contained in the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be interpreted as imposing any liability on the Company or the Committee in favor of Participant or any purchaser or other transferee of Units with respect to any loss, cost or expense which such Participant, purchaser or other transferee may incur in connection with, or arising out of any transaction involving, any Units subject to the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement.
Successors
8. . None of the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement are intended to provide for an elective deferral of compensation that would be subject to Section 409A ("Section 409A") of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Company reserves the right, to the extent the Company deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, to unilaterally amend or modify the AIP, the Notice of Award and/or this Agreement to ensure that no awards (including, without limitation, the Units) become subject to the requirements of Section 409A, provided, however, that the Company makes no representation that the Units are not subject to Section 409A nor makes any undertaking to preclude Section 409A from applying to the Units.
No Compensation Deferrals
9. . The terms of the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement are intended by the Company and Participant to be the final expression of their agreement with respect to the Units and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous agreement. The Company and Participant further intend that the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall constitute the complete and exclusive statement of their terms and that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may be introduced in any arbitration, judicial, administrative or other legal proceeding involving the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement. Accordingly, the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement contain the entire understanding between the parties and supersede all prior oral, written and implied agreements, understandings, commitments and practices among the parties.
Integration
10. . Any failure to enforce any terms or conditions of the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement by the Company or by Participant shall not be deemed a waiver of that term or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power for all or any other times.
Waivers
11. . If any provision of the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision thereof; and the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if neither of them included such provision.
Severability of Provisions
12. . This Agreement and the Notice of Award are administered and interpreted by the Committee and the Committee has full and exclusive discretion to interpret and administer this Agreement and the Notice of Award. All actions, interpretations and decisions of the Committee are conclusive and binding on all persons, and will be given the maximum possible deference allowed by law.
Committee Decisions Conclusive
 
13. . To the extent permitted by law, any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Notice of Award and the AIP, including the meaning or interpretation thereof, shall be resolved solely by arbitration before an arbitrator selected in accordance with the Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures of the American Arbitration Association. The location for the arbitration shall be in the county or comparable jurisdiction of Participant's employment. Judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each party shall pay an equal share of the arbitrator's fees, unless applicable law requires the Company to pay all or a greater share of the fees and costs. All statutes of limitation which would otherwise be applicable shall apply to any arbitration proceeding under this paragraph. Neither Participant nor the Company will have the right to participate in a class, representative or collective action, as a class representative, class member or an opt-in party, act as a private attorney general, or join or consolidate claims with claims of any other person or entity, with respect to any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Notice of Award and the AIP. The provisions of this paragraph are intended by Participant and the Company to be exclusive for all purposes and applicable to any and all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Notice of Award and the AIP. The arbitrator who hears and decides any dispute shall have jurisdiction and authority only to award compensatory damages to make whole a person or entity sustaining foreseeable economic damages, and shall not have jurisdiction and authority to make any other award of any type, including, without limitation, punitive damages, unforeseeable economic damage, damages for pain, suffering or emotional distress, or any other kind or form of damages, unless such other award is available as a matter of law. The remedy, if any, awarded by the arbitrator shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any dispute which is subject to arbitration under this paragraph.
Mandatory Arbitration
14. . The Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced according to the laws of the State of Delaware to the extent not preempted by the federal laws of the United States of America.

This Restricted Fund Unit Award Agreement, together with any Appendix(es) attached hereto (hereinafter, collectively, the "Agreement"), is made as of the Award Date set forth in the Notice of Restricted Fund Unit Award (the "Notice of Award") between Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") and the Participant named therein ("Participant"). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the same meaning as set forth in the AIP (as defined below).
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors and stockholders of the Company have adopted the Franklin Resources, Inc. Amended and Restated Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (the "AIP") to reward eligible individuals for contributions made to the Company; and
WHEREAS, the Company recognizes the efforts and contributions of Participant on behalf of the Company and its subsidiaries and desires to motivate Participant in Participant's work and provide an inducement to remain in the service of the Company and its subsidiaries; and
WHEREAS, the Company has determined that it would be to the advantage and in the interest of the Company and its stockholders to grant Participant an award (the "Award") of restricted fund units (the "Units"), as provided for in this Agreement and the Notice of Award, subject to certain restrictions, as a reward and an incentive for increased efforts and successful achievements;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
1. . The Company is issuing to Participant Units as set forth in the Notice of Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Participant as owner thereof as set forth in this Agreement.
Restricted Fund Unit Award
2. . The Units may not be transferred by Participant in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Participant may designate a beneficiary of the Units in the event of Participant's death on the beneficiary designation form included in the Notice of Award. The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and transferees of Participant.
Transfer Restriction
3. .
Vesting
(a) The Units shall become vested in accordance with the Vesting Schedule in the Notice of Award so long as Participant maintains a continuous status as an employee of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company.
(b) If Participant ceases to maintain a continuous status as an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries for any reason other than death or disability (as described in subparagraph (c)), all Units to the extent not yet vested under subparagraph (a) on the date Participant ceases to be an employee shall be forfeited by Participant without payment of any consideration to Participant therefor. Any Units so forfeited shall be canceled.
 
(c) If Participant dies or in the event of termination of Participant's continuous status as an employee as a result of disability (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance with the policies of the Company) while an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, the Units awarded hereunder shall become fully vested as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board of Directors of the Company, "disability" means that Participant ceases to be an employee on account of disability as a result of which Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long-term disability policy.
(d) In the event of a proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company or of a merger or corporate combination of the Company (a "Transaction") in which the successor entity does not agree to assume the Award or substitute an equivalent award, the Company shall make a determination as to the equitable treatment of the Award and shall notify Participant of such treatment no later than ten (10) days prior to the consummation of such proposed Transaction. In the event the Award is not assumed in connection with a Transaction, the Award will terminate upon the consummation of such proposed Transaction.
4. .
Conversion of Units and Issuance of Fund Shares
(a) Upon each vesting date, the value of one share of the applicable class of a series of an investment company in the Franklin Templeton Investments funds ("fund") shall be issuable for each Unit that vests on such date (the "Shares"), subject to the terms and provisions of the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement. Any fractional Unit that vests on a particular date shall be converted into the value of a fractional Share. Thereafter, the Company will transfer to a broker and/or dealer or equivalent entity authorized to effect transactions in such fund shares for the account of others (the "Broker/Dealer") in the jurisdiction of Participant's employment, or cause such Broker/Dealer to receive or otherwise credit, the aggregate Vested Value (as defined below) of such Shares for the benefit of such Participant. The Broker/Dealer will then cause the Shares to be acquired on behalf of Participant and, thereafter, the Broker/Dealer will transfer such Shares to Participant. Any Shares in a fund shall be advisor class shares or equivalent, if available; otherwise, they shall be Class A shares or equivalent or, if unavailable, the Company shall make a determination as to the class of Shares. Notwithstanding the above, the Company may, in its discretion, pay to Participant all or a portion of any vested Units in cash in an amount equal to the Vested Value of the Shares. The Shares or equivalent cash payment will be issued to Participant as soon as practicable after the vesting date, but in any event, within the period ending on the later to occur of the date that is two and a half (2
 1
/
2
) months from the end of (i) Participant's tax year that includes the applicable vesting date, or (ii) the Company's tax year that includes the applicable vesting date.
(b) "Vested Value" shall mean: (i) with regard to Shares of closed-end funds, the number of vested Shares multiplied by the closing price per share of the applicable fund on the primary stock exchange or NASDAQ stock market, as applicable, on which such fund then trades on the date the underlying Units vested (or, if such date is not a trading day, on the last trading day prior to such date), less any required tax or other withholding; or (ii) with regard to non-closed end funds, the aggregate Net Asset Value (as defined below) of the Shares on the date the underlying Units vested, less any required tax or other withholding obligations.
(c) "Net Asset Value" shall mean the net asset value per share of the applicable non-closed end fund calculated on the date of determination as detailed in the fund's prospectus (or, if the date of determination is not a trading day, on the last trading day prior to the date of determination).
 
(d) In the event any one or more of the funds set forth in the Notice of Award ceases to exist, the shares of such fund represented by Units subject to the Award shall be replaced with shares of a comparable fund in the Franklin Templeton Investments funds which preserves the compensation element of the Award existing at the time the fund ceases to exist. The determination of fund comparability shall be made by the Committee and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive.
5. .
Right to Shares; Dividends
(a) Except as set forth in paragraph 5(b) of this Agreement, Participant shall not have any right in, to or with respect to any of the Shares (including any voting rights) issuable under the Award until the Award is settled by the issuance of such Shares to Participant.
(b) Any dividends that are paid from time to time with respect to the Shares represented by the Units shall be deemed reinvested in the Shares with respect to which the dividend was paid and shall be credited to Participant as additional Units. All such additional Units shall vest upon the next immediately following vesting date (in accordance with the Notice of Award).
6. .
Withholding of Taxes
(a) . Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by Participant in connection with the Units awarded, regardless of any action the Company or any of its subsidiaries takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Units awarded. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of the Units awarded or the subsequent sale of any of the Shares. The Company and its subsidiaries do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the Award to reduce or eliminate Participant's tax liability.
General
(b). Prior to any event in connection with the Units awarded (, vesting) that the Company determines may result in any tax withholding obligation, whether United States federal, state or local taxes and including any employment tax obligation (the "Tax Withholding Obligation"), Participant must arrange for the satisfaction of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company, including by means of one of the following methods:
Payment of Withholding Taxes
e.g.
(i) Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (ii) below, Participant authorizes the Company (in the exercise of its sole discretion) to withhold the number of Units sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation, provided that the Company shall withhold only the amount of Units necessary to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Unit withholding will result in issuance of a lower number of Shares or amount of equivalent cash, as applicable, to Participant.
By Unit Withholding.
(ii) . At any time not less than five (5) business days (or such fewer number of days as determined by the Committee or its designee) before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises (, a vesting date), Participant may elect to satisfy the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation by delivering to the Company an amount that the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the minimum Tax Withholding Obligation by (x) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (y) delivery of a certified check payable to the Company, or (z) such other means as specified from time to time by the Committee or its designee.
By Check, Wire Transfer or Other Means
e.g.
 
7. . This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. Nothing contained in the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be interpreted as imposing any liability on the Company or the Committee in favor of Participant or any purchaser or other transferee of Units with respect to any loss, cost or expense which such Participant, purchaser or other transferee may incur in connection with, or arising out of any transaction involving, any Units subject to the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement.
Successors
8. . None of the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement are intended to provide for an elective deferral of compensation that would be subject to Section 409A ("Section 409A") of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Company reserves the right, to the extent the Company deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, to unilaterally amend or modify the AIP, the Notice of Award and/or this Agreement to ensure that no awards (including, without limitation, the Units) become subject to the requirements of Section 409A, provided, however, that the Company makes no representation that the Units are not subject to Section 409A nor makes any undertaking to preclude Section 409A from applying to the Units.
No Compensation Deferrals
9. . The terms of the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement are intended by the Company and Participant to be the final expression of their agreement with respect to the Units and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous agreement. The Company and Participant further intend that the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall constitute the complete and exclusive statement of their terms and that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may be introduced in any arbitration, judicial, administrative or other legal proceeding involving the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement. Accordingly, the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement contain the entire understanding between the parties and supersede all prior oral, written and implied agreements, understandings, commitments and practices among the parties.
Integration
10. . Any failure to enforce any terms or conditions of the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement by the Company or by Participant shall not be deemed a waiver of that term or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power for all or any other times.
Waivers
11. . If any provision of the AIP, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision thereof; and the AIP, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if neither of them included such provision.
Severability of Provisions
12. . This Agreement and the Notice of Award are administered and interpreted by the Committee and the Committee has full and exclusive discretion to interpret and administer this Agreement and the Notice of Award. All actions, interpretations and decisions of the Committee are conclusive and binding on all persons, and will be given the maximum possible deference allowed by law.
Committee Decisions Conclusive
13. . To the extent permitted by law, any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Notice of Award and the AIP, including the meaning or interpretation thereof, shall be resolved solely by arbitration before an arbitrator selected in accordance with the Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures of the American Arbitration Association. The location for the arbitration shall be in the county or comparable jurisdiction of Participant's employment. Judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each party shall pay an equal share of the arbitrator's fees, unless applicable law requires the Company to pay all or a greater share of the fees and costs. All statutes of limitation which would otherwise be applicable shall apply to any arbitration proceeding under this paragraph. Neither Participant nor the Company will have the right to
Mandatory Arbitration
 
participate in a class, representative or collective action, as a class representative, class member or an opt-in party, act as a private attorney general, or join or consolidate claims with claims of any other person or entity, with respect to any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Notice of Award and the AIP. The provisions of this paragraph are intended by Participant and the Company to be exclusive for all purposes and applicable to any and all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Notice of Award and the AIP. The arbitrator who hears and decides any dispute shall have jurisdiction and authority only to award compensatory damages to make whole a person or entity sustaining foreseeable economic damages, and shall not have jurisdiction and authority to make any other award of any type, including, without limitation, punitive damages, unforeseeable economic damage, damages for pain, suffering or emotional distress, or any other kind or form of damages, unless such other award is available as a matter of law. The remedy, if any, awarded by the arbitrator shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any dispute which is subject to arbitration under this paragraph.
14. . The Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced according to the laws of the State of Delaware to the extent not preempted by the federal laws of the United States of America.

Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Shares subject to this Award shall vest only by Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and that such status is at the will of the Company or the applicable Subsidiary (not through the act of being hired, being granted this Award or acquiring Shares hereunder). Participant further acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this Award nor in the 2002 Plan, which is incorporated herein by this reference, affects the Company's, or a Subsidiary's, right to terminate, or to change the terms of, Participant's employment at any time, with or without cause.
Participant acknowledges that, from time to time, the Company may be in a "Blackout Period" and/or subject to applicable securities laws that could subject Participant to liability for engaging in any transaction involving the sale of the Company's shares. Participant further acknowledges and agrees that, prior to the sale of any Shares acquired under this Award, it is Participant's responsibility to determine whether or not such sale of Shares will subject Participant to liability under insider trading rules or other applicable securities laws.
 
Participant understands that the Award is subject to Participant's consent to access, and acknowledgement of having accessed, the 2002 Plan prospectus in connection with the Form S-8 registration statement for the 2002 Plan, any updates thereto, the 2002 Plan, the Award Agreement and this Notice of Award (collectively, the "2002 Plan Documents") in electronic form through the People Page on the Company's Intranet. By signing below, Participant hereby: (i) consents to access electronic copies (instead of receiving paper copies) of the 2002 Plan Documents via the Company's Intranet; (ii) represents that Participant has access to the Company's Intranet; (iii) acknowledges receipt of electronic copies, or that Participant is already in possession of paper copies, of the 2002 Plan Documents and the Company's most recent annual report to stockholders; and (iv) acknowledges that Participant is familiar with and has accepted the Award subject to the terms and provisions of the 2002 Plan Documents.
Participant may receive, without charge, upon written or oral request, paper copies of any or all of the 2002 Plan Documents, documents incorporated by reference in the Form S-8 registration statement for the 2002 Plan, and the Company's most recent annual report to stockholders by requesting them from Stock Administration at the Company, One Franklin Parkway, San Mateo, CA 94403-1906. Telephone (650) 525-8037. Participant may also withdraw Participant's consent to receive any or all documents electronically by notifying Stock Administration at the above address in writing.
In the event of Participant's death, Participant hereby designates the following as Participant's beneficiary(ies) to receive all payments and Shares due to Participant pursuant to this Award.

This designation shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and transferees of Participant only in jurisdictions where such beneficiary designations are enforceable under local law.
 
 
By Participant's electronic signature and by the signature of the Company's representative below, Participant and the Company agree that the Award is granted under and governed by the terms and conditions of the 2002 Plan, this Notice of Award and the Award Agreement.
 
 
 
This Restricted Stock Award Agreement, together with any Appendix(es) attached hereto (hereinafter, collectively, the "Agreement"), is made as of the Award Date set forth in the Notice of Restricted Stock Award (the "Notice of Award") between Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") and the Participant named therein ("Participant").
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors and stockholders of the Company have adopted the Franklin Resources, Inc. 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (the "2002 Plan"), authorizing the grant of common stock of the Company ("Stock") to eligible individuals as an incentive in connection with the performance of services for the Company and its Subsidiaries, as defined in the 2002 Plan, which is incorporated herein by this reference (capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the same meaning as set forth in the 2002 Plan or the Notice of Award, as applicable); and
WHEREAS, the Company recognizes the efforts of Participant on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries and desires to motivate Participant in Participant's work and provide an inducement to remain in the service of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and
WHEREAS, the Company has determined that it would be to the advantage and in the interest of the Company and its stockholders to award the Stock provided for in this Agreement and the Notice of Award to Participant, subject to certain restrictions, as an incentive for increased efforts and successful achievements;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
1. . The Company is issuing to Participant shares of Stock as set forth in the Notice of Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Participant as owner thereof as set forth in this Agreement. Such shares are being issued in book entry form and maintained on the books of the Bank of New York, the Company's transfer agent, or any successor thereto. All shares of Stock issued hereunder shall be deemed issued to Participant as fully paid and non assessable shares, and, subject to the restrictions set forth in the 2002 Plan and this Agreement, Participant shall have all rights of a stockholder with respect thereto, including the right to vote, to receive dividends (including stock dividends), to participate in stock splits or other recapitalizations, and to exchange such shares in a tender offer, merger, consolidation or other reorganization. The Company shall pay any applicable stock transfer taxes. Participant hereby acknowledges that Participant is acquiring the Stock issued hereunder for investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof, and that Participant does not intend to subdivide Participant's interest in the Stock with any other person.
Restricted Stock Award
2. .
Transfer Restriction
(a) No Stock issued to Participant hereunder shall be sold, transferred by gift, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise transferred or disposed of by Participant prior to the date on which it becomes vested under paragraph 3, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This paragraph shall not preclude Participant from exchanging the Stock awarded hereunder pursuant to a cash or
 
stock tender offer, merger, reorganization or consolidation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any securities (including stock dividends and stock splits) received with respect to shares of Stock which are not yet vested under paragraph 3 shall be subject to the provisions of this Agreement in the same manner and shall become fully vested at the same time as the Stock with respect to which such additional securities were issued.
(b) Participant acknowledges that, from time to time, the Company may be in a "Blackout Period" and/or subject to applicable securities laws that could subject Participant to liability for engaging in any transaction involving the sale of the Company's shares. Participant further acknowledges and agrees that, prior to the sale of any shares acquired under this Award, it is Participant's responsibility to determine whether or not such sale of shares will subject Participant to liability under insider trading rules or other applicable securities laws.
3. .
Vesting
(a) Participant's interest in the Stock awarded under paragraph 1 shall become vested and nonforfeitable in accordance with the Vesting Schedule in the Notice of Award so long as Participant maintains a Continuous Status as an Employee of the Company or a Subsidiary. Upon vesting, the Company shall, within thirty (30) days of such vesting, deliver to Participant the certificates evidencing the nonforfeitable shares (free of restrictive legends on such stock certificates), provided the withholding requirements of paragraph 4 have been satisfied. Alternatively, provided the withholding requirements of paragraph 4 have been satisfied, the Committee may permit or require that such nonforfeitable shares of Stock (free of the restrictive notations on shares of Stock issued in book-entry form) be deposited directly with a brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose or to a designated agent of the Company, and the Committee may utilize electronic or automated methods of share transfer.
(b) If Participant ceases to maintain a Continuous Status as an Employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason other than death or disability (as described in subparagraph (c)), all shares of Stock to the extent not yet vested under subparagraph (a) on the date Participant ceases to be an employee shall be forfeited by Participant without payment of any consideration to Participant therefor. Any shares of Stock so forfeited shall be canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares, to be held for future distributions under the Company's 2002 Plan.
(c) If Participant dies or in the event of termination of Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee as a result of disability (as determined by the Board in accordance with the policies of the Company) while an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Participant's interest in all shares of Stock awarded hereunder shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board, "disability" means that Participant ceases to be an employee on account of disability as a result of which Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long-term disability policy.
4. .
Withholding of Taxes
(a) . Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by Participant in connection with the Stock awarded, regardless of any action the Company or any of its Subsidiaries takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Stock awarded. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of the Stock awarded or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Stock. The Company and its Subsidiaries do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the Award to reduce or eliminate Participant's tax liability.
General
 
(b) . Prior to any event in connection with the Stock awarded (, vesting) that the Company determines may result in any tax withholding obligation, whether United States federal, state or local taxes and including any employment tax obligation (the "Tax Withholding Obligation"), Participant must arrange for the satisfaction of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company, including by means of one of the following methods:
Payment of Withholding Taxes
e.g.
(i) Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, Participant authorizes the Company (in the exercise of its sole discretion) to withhold from those unrestricted shares of Stock to be delivered to Participant upon vesting under paragraph 3 above the whole number of shares sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation, provided that the Company shall withhold only the amount of shares necessary to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Share withholding will result in the delivery of a lower number of unrestricted shares of Stock to Participant. Share withholding will generally be used to satisfy the tax liability of individuals subject to the short-swing profit restrictions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
By Share Withholding.
(ii) . Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, and provided that the terms of this clause (ii) do not violate Section 13(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Participant's acceptance of the Stock awarded constitutes Participant's instruction and authorization to the Company and any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose to sell on Participant's behalf a whole number of shares from those unrestricted shares of Stock to be delivered to Participant upon vesting under paragraph 3 above as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Such shares will be sold on the day such Tax Withholding Obligation arises (, a vesting date) or as soon thereafter as practicable. Participant will be responsible for all broker's fees and other costs of sale, and Participant agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale. To the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed the Tax Withholding Obligation, the Company agrees to pay such excess in cash to Participant. Participant acknowledges that the Company or its designee is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price, and that the proceeds of any such sale may not be sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, Participant agrees to pay to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the sale of shares described above.
By Sale of Shares
e.g.
(iii) . At any time not less than five (5) business days (or such fewer number of days as determined by the Committee or its designee) before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises (, a vesting date), Participant may elect to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by delivering to the Company an amount that the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by (x) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (y) delivery of a certified check payable to the Company, or (z) such other means as specified from time to time by the Committee or its designee.
By Check, Wire Transfer or Other Means
e.g.
5. . This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. Nothing contained in the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be interpreted as imposing any liability on the Company or the Committee in favor of Participant or any purchaser or other
Successors
 
transferee of Stock with respect to any loss, cost or expense which such Participant, purchaser or other transferee may incur in connection with, or arising out of any transaction involving, any shares of Stock subject to the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement.
6. . The terms of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement are intended by the Company and Participant to be the final expression of their agreement with respect to the shares of Stock and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous agreement. The Company and Participant further intend that the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall constitute the complete and exclusive statement of their terms and that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may be introduced in any arbitration, judicial, administrative or other legal proceeding involving the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement. Accordingly, the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement contain the entire understanding between the parties and supersede all prior oral, written and implied agreements, understandings, commitments and practices among the parties.
Integration
7. . Any failure to enforce any terms or conditions of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement by the Company or by Participant shall not be deemed a waiver of that term or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power for all or any other times.
Waivers
8. . If any provision of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision thereof; and the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if none of them included such provision.
Severability of Provisions
9. . All decisions of the Committee arising under the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be conclusive.
Committee Decisions Conclusive
10. . To the extent permitted by law, any dispute arising out of or relating to the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement, including the meaning or interpretation thereof, shall be resolved solely by arbitration before an arbitrator selected in accordance with the Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures of the American Arbitration Association. The location for the arbitration shall be in the county or comparable jurisdiction of Participant's employment. Judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each party shall pay an equal share of the arbitrator's fees, unless applicable law requires the Company to pay all or a greater share of the fees and costs. All statutes of limitation which would otherwise be applicable shall apply to any arbitration proceeding under this paragraph. Neither Participant nor the Company will have the right to participate in a class, representative or collective action, as a class representative, class member or an opt-in party, act as a private attorney general, or join or consolidate claims with claims of any other person or entity, with respect to any dispute arising out of or relating to the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement. The provisions of this paragraph are intended by Participant and the Company to be exclusive for all purposes and applicable to any and all disputes arising out of or relating to the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement. The arbitrator who hears and decides any dispute shall have jurisdiction and authority only to award compensatory damages to make whole a person or entity sustaining foreseeable economic damages, and shall not have jurisdiction and authority to make any other award of any type, including, without limitation, punitive damages, unforeseeable economic damage, damages for pain, suffering or emotional distress, or any other kind or form of damages, unless such other award is available as a matter of law. The remedy, if any, awarded by the arbitrator shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any dispute which is subject to arbitration under this paragraph.

This Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement, together with any Appendix(es) attached hereto (hereinafter, collectively, the "Agreement"), is made as of the Award Date set forth in the Notice of Restricted Stock Unit Award (the "Notice of Award") between Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") and the Participant named therein ("Participant").
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors and stockholders of the Company have adopted the Franklin Resources, Inc. 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan (the "2002 Plan"), authorizing the grant of Restricted Stock Units (as defined in the 2002 Plan) ("Units") to eligible individuals as an incentive in connection with the performance of services for the Company and its Subsidiaries, as defined in the 2002 Plan, which is incorporated herein by this reference (capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the same meaning as set forth in the 2002 Plan or the Notice of Award, as applicable); and
WHEREAS, the Company recognizes the efforts of Participant on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries and desires to motivate Participant in Participant's work and provide an inducement to remain in the service of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and
WHEREAS, the Company has determined that it would be to the advantage and in the interest of the Company and its stockholders to award Units provided for in this Agreement and the Notice of Award to Participant, subject to certain restrictions, as an incentive for increased efforts and successful achievements;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
1. . The Company is issuing to Participant Units as set forth in the Notice of Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Participant as owner thereof as set forth in this Agreement.
Restricted Stock Unit Award
2. .
Transfer Restriction
(a) Units may not be transferred by Participant in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Participant may designate a beneficiary of Units in the event of Participant's death on the beneficiary designation form included in the Notice of Award. The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and transferees of Participant.
(b) Participant acknowledges that, from time to time, the Company may be in a "Blackout Period" and/or subject to applicable securities laws that could subject Participant to liability for engaging in any transaction involving the sale of the Company's shares. Participant further acknowledges and agrees that, prior to the sale of any shares acquired under this Award, it is Participant's responsibility to determine whether or not such sale of shares will subject Participant to liability under insider trading rules or other applicable securities laws.
 
3. .
Vesting
(a) Units shall become vested in accordance with the Vesting Schedule in the Notice of Award so long as Participant maintains a Continuous Status as an Employee of the Company or a Subsidiary.
(b) If Participant ceases to maintain a Continuous Status as an Employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason other than death or disability (as described in subparagraph (c)), all Units to the extent not yet vested under subparagraph (a) on the date Participant ceases to be an employee shall be forfeited by Participant without payment of any consideration to Participant therefor. Any Units so forfeited shall be canceled and any shares considered issuable pursuant to such Units, if applicable, shall be returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares, to be held for future distributions under the Company's 2002 Plan.
(c) If Participant dies or in the event of termination of Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee as a result of disability (as determined by the Board in accordance with the policies of the Company) while an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Units awarded hereunder shall become fully vested as of the date of death or termination of employment on account of such disability. Unless changed by the Board, "disability" means that Participant ceases to be an employee on account of disability as a result of which Participant shall be eligible for payments under the Company's long-term disability policy.
4. . Upon each vesting date, one share of common stock ("Stock") shall be issuable for each Unit that vests on such date, subject to the terms and provisions of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement. Upon satisfaction of any required tax or other withholding obligations as set forth in paragraph 6 of this Agreement, the shares of Stock will be issued to Participant (as evidenced by the appropriate entry in the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) as soon as practicable after the vesting date, but in any event, within the period ending on the later to occur of the date that is two and a half (2

) months from the end of (i) Participant's tax year that includes the applicable vesting date, or (ii) the Company's tax year that includes the applicable vesting date. Any fractional Unit remaining after all Units under this Award are fully vested shall be discarded and a fractional share of Stock shall not be issued at vesting of the fractional Unit. Notwithstanding the above, the Company may, in its discretion, pay to Participant all or a portion of any vested Units in cash in an amount equal to the shares of Stock, less any tax or other withholding obligations set forth in paragraph 6 of this Agreement.
5. . Participant shall not have any right in, to or with respect to any of the shares of Stock (including any voting rights or rights with respect to dividends paid on the Stock) issuable for a Unit under the Award until the Award is settled by the issuance of such shares of Stock to Participant.
Right to Shares
 
6. .
Withholding of Taxes
(a) . Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by Participant in connection with Units awarded, regardless of any action the Company or any of its Subsidiaries takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with Units awarded. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of Units awarded or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Stock. The Company and its Subsidiaries do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the Award to reduce or eliminate Participant's tax liability.
General
(b) . Prior to any event in connection with Units awarded (, vesting) that the Company determines may result in any tax withholding obligation, whether United States federal, state or local taxes and including any employment tax obligation (the "Tax Withholding Obligation"), Participant must arrange for the satisfaction of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company, including by means of one of the following methods:
Payment of Withholding Taxes
e.g.
(i) Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, Participant authorizes the Company (in the exercise of its sole discretion) to withhold from those shares of Stock issuable to Participant the whole number of shares sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation, provided that the Company shall withhold only the amount of shares necessary to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Share withholding will result in issuance of a lower number of shares of Stock to Participant. Share withholding will generally be used to satisfy the tax liability of individuals subject to the short-swing profit restrictions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
By Share Withholding.
(ii) . Unless Participant determines to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, and provided that the terms of this clause (ii) do not violate Section 13(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Participant's acceptance of the Award constitutes Participant's instruction and authorization to the Company and any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose to sell on Participant's behalf a whole number of shares from those shares of Stock issuable to Participant as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Such shares will be sold on the day such Tax Withholding Obligation arises (, a vesting date) or as soon thereafter as practicable. Participant will be responsible for all broker's fees and other costs of sale, and Participant agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale. To the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed the Tax Withholding Obligation, the Company agrees to pay such excess in cash to Participant. Participant acknowledges that the Company or its designee is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price, and that the proceeds of any such sale may not be sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, Participant agrees to pay to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the sale of shares described above.
By Sale of Shares
e.g.
(iii) . At any time not less than five (5) business days (or such fewer number of days as determined by the Committee or its designee) before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises (, a vesting date), Participant may elect to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by delivering to the Company an amount that the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by (x) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (y) delivery of a certified check payable to the Company, or (z) such other means as specified from time to time by the Committee or its designee.
By Check, Wire Transfer or Other Means
e.g.
 
7. . This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. Nothing contained in the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be interpreted as imposing any liability on the Company or the Committee in favor of Participant or any purchaser or other transferee of Units or shares of Stock with respect to any loss, cost or expense which such Participant, purchaser or other transferee may incur in connection with, or arising out of any transaction involving, any Units or shares of Stock subject to the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement.
Successors
8. . None of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement are intended to provide for an elective deferral of compensation that would be subject to Section 409A ("Section 409A") of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Company reserves the right, to the extent the Company deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, to unilaterally amend or modify the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and/or this Agreement to ensure that no awards (including, without limitation, the Units) become subject to the requirements of Section 409A, provided, however, that the Company makes no representation that the Units are not subject to Section 409A nor makes any undertaking to preclude Section 409A from applying to the Units.
No Compensation Deferrals
9. . The terms of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement are intended by the Company and Participant to be the final expression of their agreement with respect to Units and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous agreement. The Company and Participant further intend that the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall constitute the complete and exclusive statement of their terms and that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may be introduced in any arbitration, judicial, administrative or other legal proceeding involving the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement. Accordingly, the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement contain the entire understanding between the parties and supersede all prior oral, written and implied agreements, understandings, commitments and practices among the parties.
Integration
10. . Any failure to enforce any terms or conditions of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement by the Company or by Participant shall not be deemed a waiver of that term or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power for all or any other times.
Waivers
11. . If any provision of the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision thereof; and the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if none of them included such provision.
Severability of Provisions
12. . All decisions of the Committee arising under the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be conclusive.
Committee Decisions Conclusive
13. . To the extent permitted by law, any dispute arising out of or relating to the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement, including the meaning or interpretation thereof, shall be resolved solely by arbitration before an arbitrator selected in accordance with the Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures of the American Arbitration Association. The location for the arbitration shall be in the county or comparable jurisdiction of Participant's employment. Judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each party shall pay an equal share of the arbitrator's fees, unless applicable law requires the Company to pay all or a greater share of the fees and costs. All statutes of limitation which would otherwise be applicable shall apply to any arbitration proceeding under this paragraph. Neither Participant nor the Company will have the right
Mandatory Arbitration
 
to participate in a class, representative or collective action, as a class representative, class member or an opt-in party, act as a private attorney general, or join or consolidate claims with claims of any other person or entity, with respect to any dispute arising out of or relating to the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement. The provisions of this paragraph are intended by Participant and the Company to be exclusive for all purposes and applicable to any and all disputes arising out of or relating to the 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement. The arbitrator who hears and decides any dispute shall have jurisdiction and authority only to award compensatory damages to make whole a person or entity sustaining foreseeable economic damages, and shall not have jurisdiction and authority to make any other award of any type, including, without limitation, punitive damages, unforeseeable economic damage, damages for pain, suffering or emotional distress, or any other kind or form of damages, unless such other award is available as a matter of law. The remedy, if any, awarded by the arbitrator shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any dispute which is subject to arbitration under this paragraph.
14. . The 2002 Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced according to the laws of the State of Delaware to the extent not preempted by the federal laws of the United States of America.
