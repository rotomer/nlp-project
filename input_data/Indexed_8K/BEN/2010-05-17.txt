Additionally, the Company has a $420.0 million five-year revolving credit facility with certain banks and financial institutions that expires on June 9, 2010. There are currently no amounts outstanding, and the Company has never borrowed under this facility. The Company has decided, at present, not to renew this facility after considering the costs relative to the potential benefits of maintaining such a facility.
