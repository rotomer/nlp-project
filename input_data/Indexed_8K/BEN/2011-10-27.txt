(Franklin) and its subsidiaries, which are not   historical facts, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this presentation, words or   phrases generally written in the future tense and/or preceded by words such as will, may, could, expect, believe, anticipate, intend, plan, seek, estimate,   preliminary or other similar words are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other   important factors, some of which are listed below, that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied   by such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other   future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to   predict. We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of   future performance.      These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklins recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,   including, without limitation, in Risk Factors and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Franklins Annual Report on   Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, and Franklins subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q: (1) volatility and disruption of the capital and credit   markets, and adverse changes in the global economy, may significantly affect our results of operations and may put pressure on our financial results; (2) the amount and mix   of our assets under management (AUM) are subject to significant fluctuations; (3) we are subject to extensive and complex, overlapping and frequently changing rules,   regulations and legal interpretations; (4) regulatory and legislative actions and reforms have made the regulatory environment in which we operate more costly and future   actions and reforms could adversely impact our AUM, increase costs and negatively impact our profitability and future financial results; (5) changes in tax laws or exposure to   additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity; (6) any significant limitation or failure of our software   applications, technology or other systems that are critical to our operations could constrain our operations; (7) our investment management business operations are complex   and a failure to properly perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of our products and services could have an adverse effect on our revenues and income; (8) we   face risks, and corresponding potential costs and expenses, associated with conducting operations and growing our business in numerous countries; (9) we depend on key   personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services; (10) strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies   with competing offerings and products could limit or reduce sales of our products, potentially resulting in a decline in our market share, revenues and net income; (11)   changes in the third-party distribution and sales channels on which we depend could reduce our revenues and hinder our growth; (12) our increasing focus on international   markets as a source of investments and sales of investment products subjects us to increased exchange rate and other risks in connection with earnings and income   generated overseas; (13) poor investment performance of our products could affect our sales or reduce the level of AUM, potentially negatively impacting our revenues and   income; (14) we could suffer losses in earnings or revenue if our reputation is harmed; (15) our future results are dependent upon maintaining an appropriate level of   expenses, which is subject to fluctuation; (16) our ability to successfully integrate widely varied business lines can be impeded by systems and other technological limitations;   (17) our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital,   regulatory actions, reputational harm, or legal liability; (18) certain of the portfolios we manage, including our emerging market portfolios, are vulnerable to significant market-   specific political, economic or other risks, any of which may negatively impact our revenues and income; (19) our revenues, earnings, and income could be adversely   affected if the terms of our management agreements are significantly altered or these agreements are terminated by the funds and other sponsored investment products we   advise; (20) regulatory and governmental examinations and/or investigations, litigation, and the legal risks associated with our business, could adversely impact our AUM,   increase costs and negatively impact our profitability and/or our future financial results; (21) our ability to meet cash needs depends upon certain factors, including the market   value of our assets, operating cash flows and our perceived creditworthiness; (22) diverse and strong competition limits the interest rates that we can charge on consumer   loans; (23) our business could be negatively affected if we or our banking subsidiaries fail to remain well capitalized, and liquidity needs could affect our banking business;   and (24) we are dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries.      Any forward-looking statement made by us in this presentation speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ   may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them.
