In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth: (i) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director (A) all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and (B) such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected; (ii) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws of the Corporation, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (iii) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (A) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, (B) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, (C) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to the nomination or proposal between or among such stockholder and/or such beneficial owner, any of their respective affiliates or associates, and any others acting in concert with any of the foregoing, including, in the case of a nomination, the nominee, (D) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, warrants, convertible securities, stock appreciation or similar rights, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares) that has been entered into as of the date of the stockholder's notice by, or on behalf of, such stockholder and such beneficial owners, whether or not such instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in underlying shares of capital stock of the Corporation, the
 
effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, manage risk or benefit of share price changes for, or increase or decrease the voting power of, such stockholder or such beneficial owner, with respect to securities of the Corporation, (E) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, (F) a representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group which intends (I) to deliver a proxy statement and proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (II) otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such proposal or nomination, and (G) any other information relating to such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the proposal and/or for the election of directors in an election contest pursuant to and in accordance with Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The foregoing notice requirements of this paragraph (a) of this Section 2.3 shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder with respect to business other than a nomination if the stockholder has notified the Corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act and such stockholder's proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation.
(3)      Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 2.3 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors at an annual meeting is increased effective after the time period for which nominations would otherwise be due under paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 2.3 and there is no public announcement by the Corporation specifying the number of directors to be elected or naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least 120 days day prior to the first anniversary of the date on which the Corporation first (i) mailed its notice of annual meeting, proxy statement and proxy or (ii) or sent its notice of annual meeting and notice of internet availability of its proxy materials, whichever is earlier, for the immediately preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 2.3 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.
(b)      Special Meetings of Stockholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at

In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 2.3 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 150th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 120th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made by the Corporation of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.

Except as otherwise provided by law, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (i) to determine whether a stockholder nomination or any business proposed by a stockholder to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.3 (including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of such stockholder's nominee or proposal in compliance with such stockholder's representation as required by clause (a)(2)(iii)(F) of this Section 2.3) and (ii) if any such proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this Section 2.3, to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3, unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present a nomination or proposed business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted,

If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix as the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record as of the record date so fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting

Section 2.8     . The holders of a majority in voting power of the shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at a meeting of the stockholders shall constitute a quorum thereat for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by statute, by the Certificate or by these Bylaws.

Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy pursuant to the previous sentence, a writing signed by the stockholder, a facsimile signed by the stockholder or other electronic transmission from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or by delivering a proxy in accordance with applicable law bearing a later date to the Secretary of the Corporation.
(c) Voting.
Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot and, unless otherwise required by law, need not be conducted by inspectors of election unless so determined by the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the voting power which could be cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon which are present in person or by proxy at such meeting.

For purposes of this Section 2.11(c), a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted for' a director must exceed the number of shares voted against' that director. All other elections and questions shall, unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate or these Bylaws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, or applicable law or pursuant to any regulation applicable to the Corporation or its securities, be decided by the vote of the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the voting power present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in these Bylaws, (x) the non-binding advisory vote with respect to executive compensation pursuant to Section 14A(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, shall require the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast thereon, and (y) the non-binding advisory vote, pursuant to Section 14A(a)(2) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, with respect to the determination as to whether the vote described in the preceding clause (x) shall occur every one (1), two (2) or three (3) years shall be decided by a plurality of the votes cast; provided that for purposes of any vote required pursuant to this sentence, neither abstentions nor broker non-votes shall count as votes cast.
Section 2.12     . In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or

A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting.

Shares of the Corporation's stock may be evidenced by certificates for shares of stock or may be issued in uncertificated form in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
