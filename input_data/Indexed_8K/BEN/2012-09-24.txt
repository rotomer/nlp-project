On September 19, 2012, Franklin Resources, Inc. (the "Company") entered into: (i) an underwriting agreement (the "2017 Underwriting Agreement") with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as representatives (the "Representatives") of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to the Underwriters $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 1.375% Notes due 2017 (the "2017 Notes") and (ii) an underwriting agreement (the "2022 Underwriting Agreement", and together with the 2017 Underwriting Agreement, the "Underwriting Agreements") with the Representatives, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to the Underwriters $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.800% Notes due 2022 (the "2022 Notes", and together with the 2017 Notes, the "Notes"), for sale by the Underwriters (collectively, the "Offering") pursuant to the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-183969) (the "Registration Statement"). On September 19, 2012, the Company priced the Offering and on September 24, 2012, the Offering closed. The Company realized approximately $593.9 million in proceeds from the Offering, net of underwriting discounts and commissions. The Company intends to use approximately $305 million of the net proceeds of the Offering to redeem all of its outstanding 2.000% notes due May 20, 2013, approximately $183 million to finance its acquisition of a majority stake in K2 Advisors Holdings LLC and the remainder for general corporate purposes. The foregoing does not constitute a notice of redemption for or an obligation to issue a notice of redemption for the Company's outstanding notes.
The Underwriters have performed investment banking and advisory services for the Company and for certain of the Company's funds from time to time in the ordinary course, for which certain of the Underwriters may have received customary fees and expenses. These services have included acting as underwriters and distributors and providing financing. The Underwriters may, from time to time, engage in other transactions with and perform services for the Company and its funds in the ordinary course of their business.
The Notes were issued by the Company under an Indenture, dated as of May 19, 1994 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor to Chemical Bank, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), as amended and supplemented by a first supplemental indenture, dated as of October 9, 1996 (the "First Supplemental Indenture") and a third supplemental indenture, dated as of September 24, 2012 (inclusive of the form of Global Note for each series of the Notes, the "Third Supplemental Indenture"). The Base Indenture as amended and supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture and the Third Supplemental Indenture is referred to as the "Indenture."
Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2013. The 2017 Notes will mature on September 15, 2017 and the 2022 Notes will mature on September 15, 2022. The Notes will be unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company and will rank equal in right of payment with respect to each other and with all of the Company's existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future debt of the Company's subsidiaries.
The Company may redeem the Notes prior to maturity in whole or in part at any time, at its option, at certain "make-whole" redemption prices. In the case of any such redemption, the Company will also pay accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.
The Indenture contains, subject to exceptions, limitations on the Company's ability and the ability of certain of its subsidiaries to pledge voting stock or profit participating equity interests in the subsidiaries to secure other debt without also similarly securing the Notes equally and ratably. The Indenture also includes requirements that must be met if the Company consolidates or merges with, or sells all or substantially all of its assets to, another entity.
The Notes contain customary events of default, including:

This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
Indemnification and Contribution
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, (ii) under the heading "Underwriting", (A) the first paragraph, (B) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (C) the fourth
 
paragraph related to concessions and reallowances, (D) the sixth and seventh paragraphs related to stabilization and syndicate covering transactions and (E) the third sentence of the eleventh paragraph related to allocation of the Securities in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party.

provided
however
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably
 
incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
provided
however
9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the
Default by an Underwriter
provided
however
 
aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
10. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such delivery and payment (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal, New York State or California authorities, (iii) a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
Termination
11. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.

4. Other than as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus Supplement, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect and, to my knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened by governmental authorities or by others.

This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
Indemnification and Contribution
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, (ii) under the heading "Underwriting", (A) the first paragraph, (B) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (C) the fourth
 
paragraph related to concessions and reallowances, (D) the sixth and seventh paragraphs related to stabilization and syndicate covering transactions and (E) the third sentence of the eleventh paragraph related to allocation of the Securities in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party.

provided
however
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably
 
incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.

In such examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as certified, conformed or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. As to all questions of fact material to this opinion that have not been independently established, I have relied upon certificates or comparable documents of officers and representatives of the Company and upon the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Underwriting Agreements. As used herein, "to my knowledge" means the conscious awareness of facts or other information by me or other lawyers in the Company's legal department responsible for the matters described herein.

4. Other than as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus Supplement, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect and, to my knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened by governmental authorities or by others.

Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications stated herein, we are of the opinion that:

Based solely on a telephone confirmation by the Staff of the Commission, we are not aware of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any notice objecting to its use. To our knowledge, no proceedings therefor have been instituted or overtly threatened by the Commission.
7. The execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreements by the Company have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. The Underwriting Agreements have been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company.
8. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Underwriting Agreements and the Indenture and the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder, including the issuance and sale of the Notes, will not conflict with, constitute a default under or violate (i) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, or the Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Company, (ii) New York, Delaware corporate or federal law or regulation (other than federal and state securities or blue sky laws, as to which we express no opinion in this paragraph) or (iii) any judgment, writ, injunction, decree, order or ruling of any court or governmental authority binding on the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries of which we are aware.
9. No consent, approval, waiver, license or authorization or other action by or filing with any New York, Delaware corporate or federal governmental authority is required in connection with the execution and delivery by the Company of the Underwriting Agreements, the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby or the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder, except for filings and other actions required pursuant to federal and state securities or blue sky laws, as to which we express no opinion in this paragraph.
10.

11. The statements made in the Disclosure Package and Prospectus under the caption "Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders," insofar as they constitute statements of United States federal income tax law or legal conclusions with respect thereto, and subject to the limitations set forth therein, fairly summarize the matters referred to therein in all material respects.
12. The statements in the Disclosure Package and Prospectus under the caption "Certain ERISA Considerations," insofar as such statements purport to describe provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or Section 4975 of U.S. federal tax law
