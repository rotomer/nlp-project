Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklins recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, in Risk Factors and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Franklins Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 and Franklins subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q: (1) volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets, and adverse changes in the global economy, may significantly affect our results of operations and may put pressure on our financial results; (2) the amount and mix of our assets under management (AUM) are subject to significant fluctuations; (3) we are subject to extensive and complex, overlapping and frequently changing rules, regulations and legal interpretations; (4) regulatory and legislative actions and reforms have made the regulatory environment in which we operate more costly and future actions and reforms could adversely impact our AUM, increase costs and negatively impact our profitability and future financial results; (5) failure to comply with the laws, rules or regulations in any of the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate could result in substantial harm to our reputation and results of operations; (6) changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity; (7) any significant limitation, failure or security breach of our software applications, technology or other systems that are critical to our operations could constrain our operations; (8) our business operations are complex and a failure to properly perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of our products and services could have an adverse effect on our revenues and income; (9) we face risks, and corresponding potential costs and expenses, associated with conducting operations and growing our business in numerous countries; (10) we depend on key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services; (11) strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies with competing offerings and products could limit or reduce sales of our products, potentially resulting in a decline in our market share, revenues and income; (12) changes in the third-party distribution and sales channels on which we depend could reduce our income and hinder our growth; (13) our increasing focus on international markets as a source of investments and sales of investment products subjects us to increased exchange rate and other risks in connection with our revenues and income generated overseas; (14) poor investment performance of our products could affect our sales or reduce the level of AUM, potentially negatively impacting our revenues and income; (15) we could suffer losses in our revenues and income if our reputation is harmed; (16) our future results are dependent upon maintaining an appropriate level of expenses, which is subject to fluctuation; (17) our ability to successfully integrate widely varied business lines can be impeded by systems and other technological limitations; (18) our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, or legal liability; (19) certain of the portfolios we manage, including our emerging market portfolios, are vulnerable to significant market-specific political, economic or other risks, any of which may negatively impact our revenues and income; (20) regulatory and governmental examinations and/or investigations, litigation and the legal risks associated with our business, could adversely impact our AUM, increase costs and negatively impact our profitability and/or our future financial results; (21) our ability to meet cash needs depends upon certain factors, including the market value of our assets, operating cash flows and our perceived creditworthiness; (22) our business could be negatively affected if we or our banking subsidiaries fail to remain well capitalized, and liquidity needs could affect our banking services; and (23) we are dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this presentation speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them.
