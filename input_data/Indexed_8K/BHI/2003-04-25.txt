This information shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

In addition to financial results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") that were included in the news release, the release also included certain non-GAAP financial measures (as defined under the SEC's Regulation G), which same measures were also discussed on the conference call. The following non-GAAP financial measures were described: o EBIT and EBITDA: EBIT is earnings before interest expense and income taxes and EBITDA is earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Management uses EBIT and EBITDA because it believes that such measurements are widely accepted financial indicators used by investors and analysts to analyze and compare companies on the basis of operating performance and that such measurements may be used by some investors and others to make informed investment decisions. o Operating profit: Operating profit is defined as income from continuing operations excluding the impact of non-operational items. The Company believes that operating profit is useful to investors because it is a consistent measure of the underlying results of the Company's business. Furthermore, management uses the calculation of operating profit internally as a measure of the performance of the Company's divisions. The foregoing non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as an alternative for, or superior to, net income, income from continuing operations, cash flows or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP as more fully discussed in the Company's financial statements and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The attached release includes a reconciliation of the non-GAAP information used by the Company to its nearest comparable GAAP financial measure. GAAP reconciliations can also be found on the Company's website at www.bakerhughes.com/investor in the Financial Information section under the Impact of Non-Operational Items heading and in the applicable earnings releases under the Earnings Releases heading. SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT INDEX

EXHIBIT 99.1 Baker Hughes Announces First Quarter Results HOUSTON, Texas - April 22, 2003. Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHI - NYSE, PCX, EBS) announced today that income from continuing operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for the first quarter of 2003 was $47.4 million or $0.14 per share (diluted) compared to $70.6 million or $0.21 per share (diluted) for the first quarter of 2002 and a loss from continuing operations of ($2.3) million or ($0.01) per share (diluted) for the fourth quarter of 2002. Net income for the first quarter of 2003 was $44.5 million or $0.13 per share (diluted) compared to $33.3 million or $0.10 per share (diluted) for the first quarter of 2002 and a net loss of ($1.5) million or ($0.01) per share (diluted) for the fourth quarter of 2002. In the first quarter of 2003, the company recorded a $5.6 million after-tax charge or $0.02 per share (diluted), related to the cumulative effect of an accounting change resulting from the adoption of SFAS 143, Asset Retirement Obligations. In the first quarter of 2002, the company recorded a $42.5 million after-tax charge or $0.13 per share (diluted), related to the cumulative effect of an accounting change resulting from the adoption of SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Operating profit, which is income from continuing operations excluding the impact of non-operational items, for the first quarter of 2003 was $47.4 million or $0.14 per share (diluted) compared to $70.6 million or $0.21 per share (diluted) for the first quarter of 2002 and $84.5 million or $0.25 per share (diluted) for the fourth quarter of 2002. The non-operational item in the fourth quarter of 2002 was a $90.2 million pre-tax charge ($86.8 million after-tax or $0.26 per share), which is the company's 30% share of a restructuring charge announced by Schlumberger Ltd. in December 2002 relating to the company's seismic joint venture, WesternGeco. (See Reconciliation of GAAP Results and Operating Results below.) Revenue for the first quarter of 2003 was $1,226.5 million, compared to $1,203.0 million for the first quarter of 2002 and $1,292.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2002. Oilfield Operations revenue for the first quarter of 2003 was $1,200.1 million, up 2% compared to $1,176.1 million for the first quarter of 2002, and down 5% compared to $1,262.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2002. Michael E. Wiley, Baker Hughes' Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, said, "While North American onshore activity improved sequentially, the US offshore rig count sequentially declined by 10%. International results were negatively affected by a slow recovery in Venezuela, civil unrest in Nigeria, weakening North Sea markets and associated price erosion, as well as product shipment delays to Russia and the Middle East. Our expectations for the remainder of the year are in line with our original plans." FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY In September 2002, the company's Board of Directors authorized the company to repurchase up to $275.0 million of its common stock. During the first quarter of 2003, approximately 300,000 shares were purchased at an average price of $28.69 per share and retired. The company has authorization remaining to purchase up to $217.3 million in stock. During the first quarter, debt decreased $30.6 million to $1,517.2 million, and cash decreased to $51.7 million.
SALE OF WEST AFRICAN OIL PRODUCING OPERATIONS In December 2002, the company entered into exclusive negotiations for the sale of its interest in its oil producing operations in West Africa and received $10 million as a deposit. Accordingly, the operation was classified as a discontinued business. The transaction was effective as of January 1, 2003. The company received the remaining $22.0 million in proceeds upon closing, which occurred in April 2003.

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP RESULTS AND OPERATING RESULTS The following tables reconcile GAAP and operating results referenced in this news release. Reconciliation of other prior periods can be found on the company's website at www.bakerhughes.com/investor. RECONCILIATION OF GAAP RESULTS AND OPERATING RESULTS (for the three months ended December 31, 2002) SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS Operational highlights for the three months ended March 31, 2003 and March 31, 2002 and the three months ended December 31, 2002 are detailed below. All results are unaudited and shown in millions. COMPARISON OF QUARTERS -- YEAR OVER YEAR (for the three months ended March 31, 2003 and 2002) COMPARISON OF QUARTERS -- SEQUENTIAL (for the three months ended March 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002)
OILFIELD OPERATIONS SEGMENT Unless otherwise noted, all comments in this section refer to Baker Hughes' Oilfield Operations, excluding WesternGeco. The following table details the percentage change in revenue in the March 2003 quarter compared to the March 2002 quarter and December 2002 quarter. COMPARISON OF REVENUE (for the three months ended March 31, 2003 compared to the three months ended) UNAUDITED Oilfield Operations revenue for the first quarter of 2003 increased 2% compared to the first quarter of 2002 and decreased 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2002. Sequentially, revenues increased at INTEQ and Hughes Christensen, and were essentially flat at Baker Petrolite. The sequential decline at Centrilift was largely due to strong fourth quarter sales into Russia. The sequential decline at Baker Atlas was primarily due to stronger fourth quarter sales into China. The sequential decline at Baker Oil Tools was due to delayed shipments of orders to the Middle East, Nigeria and Venezuela. INTEQ, Centrilift, Hughes Christensen and Baker Petrolite reported revenue improvements compared to year ago levels. The operating profit before tax margin ("operating margin") was 11.8% for the first quarter of 2003 compared to 15.3% in the fourth quarter of 2002 and 13.8% for the first quarter a year ago. Operating margins improved sequentially at Baker Petrolite and improved compared to the same period a year ago at Baker Petrolite and Hughes Christensen. Operating margins at INTEQ and Baker Oil Tools were below 10%. Subsequent to the first quarter of 2003, the company completed the formation of the QuantX Wellbore Instrumentation venture with Expro International. The venture, which is a leader in the rapidly growing permanent in-well monitoring market, was formed by combining Expro's existing permanent monitoring business with Baker Hughes' In-Form product line. Baker Hughes also paid Expro $30 million and owns 50% of the venture. PROCESS OPERATIONS SEGMENT Process revenues were $26.4 million in the first quarter of 2003, compared to $26.9 million in the first quarter of 2002, and $29.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. The operating loss was ($4.8) million, which compares to a loss of ($3.3) million in the same period a year ago, and a loss of ($4.1) million in the
December 2002 quarter. The market for sales of capital equipment into the chemical market remains depressed. In response, BIRD incurred additional costs in the first quarter of 2003 in adjusting its workforce to more closely match decreased market demand. CORPORATE, NET INTEREST AND OTHER Corporate, net interest and other expenses were $60.1 million in the March 2003 quarter, down $2.0 million from the March 2002 quarter and down $4.7 million from the December 2002 quarter. The decrease in the March 2003 quarter, as compared to the March 2002 quarter, was due primarily to lower net interest expense. The decrease in the March 2003 quarter as compared to the December 2002 quarter was due to lower net interest expense, decreased foreign exchange losses and lower corporate general and administrative expenses.
