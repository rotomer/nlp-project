EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Press Release of Baker Hughes Incorporated dated July 24, 2003.

EXHIBIT 99.1 Baker Hughes Announces Second Quarter Results HOUSTON, Texas - July 24, 2003. Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHI - NYSE, PCX, EBS) announced today that income from continuing operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for the second quarter of 2003 was $81.6 million or $0.24 per share (diluted) compared to $68.6 million or $0.20 per share (diluted) for the second quarter of 2002 and $47.4 million or $0.14 per share (diluted) for the first quarter of 2003. Net income for the second quarter of 2003 was $81.6 million or $0.24 per share (diluted) compared to $72.4 million or $0.21 per share (diluted) for the second quarter of 2002 and $44.5 million or $0.13 per share (diluted) for the first quarter of 2003. In the first quarter of 2003, the company recorded a after-tax charge of $5.6 million or $0.02 per share (diluted) related to the cumulative effect of an accounting change resulting from the adoption of SFAS 143, Asset Retirement Obligations. In the second quarter of 2002, the company recorded a $1.2 million after-tax credit, or $0.00 per share (diluted), related to the reversal of an excess restructuring accrual for the German operation of Bird Machine in the company's Process segment. Operating profit, which is a non-GAAP measure for income from continuing operations excluding the impact of non-operational items, was the same in the first and second quarters of 2003 as income from continuing operations. Operating profit for the second quarter of 2002, excluding the credit referenced above, was $67.4 million or $0.20 per share (diluted). The company believes that operating profit is useful to investors because it is a consistent measure of the underlying results of the company's business. Furthermore, management uses the calculation of operating profit internally as a measure of the performance of the company's divisions. (See Reconciliation of GAAP Results and Operating Results below.) Revenue for the second quarter of 2003 was $1,341.4 million, compared to $1,245.1 million for the second quarter of 2002 and $1,226.5 million for the first quarter of 2003. Oilfield Operations revenue for the second quarter of 2003 was $1,314.8 million, up 8.5% compared to $1,211.8 million for the second quarter of 2002, and up 9.6% compared to $1,200.1 million for the first quarter of 2003. Michael E. Wiley, Baker Hughes' Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, said, "International market conditions impacting the first quarter improved in the second quarter and domestic land activity continued to increase. Baker Hughes is positioned to take advantage of further improvements in the market as the balance between supply and demand for our products and services continues to tighten." FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY As previously announced, the company entered into a $500 million three-year revolving credit facility in July 2003, which will be used for commercial paper back-up and general corporate purposes. The facility replaces an aggregate of $594 million in credit lines that were scheduled to mature in the fall of 2003. In September 2002, the company's Board of Directors authorized the company to repurchase up to $275.0 million of its common stock. During the second quarter of 2003, approximately 2.2 million shares were purchased at an average price of $28.69 per share and retired. The company has authorization remaining to purchase up to $153.0 million in stock. During the second quarter of 2003, debt increased $89.1 million to $1,606.3 million, and cash increased $19.3 million to $71.0 million.
CALCULATION OF EBIT AND EBITDA (NON-GAAP MEASURES)(1) (1) EBIT and EBITDA are non-GAAP measurements. Management uses EBIT and EBITDA because it believes that such measurements are widely accepted financial indicators used by investors and analysts to analyze and compare companies on the basis of operating performance and that these measurements may be used by some investors and others to make informed investment decisions.
CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED BALANCE SHEETS
RECONCILIATION OF GAAP RESULTS AND OPERATING RESULTS The following table reconciles GAAP and operating results referenced in this news release. Reconciliation of other prior periods can be found on the company's website at www.bakerhughes.com/investor. RECONCILIATION OF GAAP RESULTS AND OPERATING RESULTS (for the three months ended June 30, 2002) SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS Operational highlights for the three months ended June 30, 2003, June 30, 2002, and March 31, 2003 are detailed below. All results are unaudited and shown in millions. COMPARISON OF QUARTERS -- YEAR OVER YEAR (for the three months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002) COMPARISON OF QUARTERS -- SEQUENTIAL (for the three months ended June 30, 2003 and March 31, 2003)
OILFIELD OPERATIONS SEGMENT Unless otherwise noted, all comments in this section refer to Baker Hughes' Oilfield Operations, excluding WesternGeco, the company's seismic venture with Schlumberger Ltd. The following table details the percentage change in revenue in the June 2003 quarter compared to the June 2002 quarter and the March 2003 quarter. COMPARISON OF REVENUE for the three months ended June 30, 2003 compared to the three months ended: UNAUDITED Oilfield Operations revenue for the second quarter of 2003 increased 8.5% compared to the second quarter of 2002 and increased 9.6% compared to the first quarter of 2003. Revenue increased both sequentially and compared to the same period a year ago at every division. Substantially all of the product shipments delayed in the first quarter of 2003 were shipped in the second quarter. The non-GAAP measure of operating profit before tax margin ("operating margin") was 15.1% for the second quarter of 2003 compared to 13.5% in the second quarter of 2002, and 11.8% in the first quarter of 2003. Operating margins improved sequentially at all divisions and improved compared to the same period a year ago at all divisions except INTEQ. Every division except INTEQ reported operating margins of at least 10% in the second quarter of 2003. PROCESS OPERATIONS SEGMENT Process Operations revenues were $26.6 million in the second quarter of 2003, compared to $33.3 million in the second quarter of 2002, and $26.4 million in the first quarter of 2003. The operating loss was ($1.6) million, which compares to a loss of ($1.1) million in the same period a year ago, and a loss of ($4.8) million in the first quarter of 2003. Demand for capital equipment in the chemical market remains depressed. In response, Bird Machine incurred costs in the first and second quarters of 2003 associated with reductions made to its workforce to more closely match decreased market demand. CORPORATE, NET INTEREST AND OTHER Corporate, net interest and other expenses were $61.6 million in the June 2003 quarter, down $1.0 million when compared to the June 2002 quarter and up $1.5 million when compared to the March 2003 quarter. The increase in the June 2003 quarter, as compared to the March 2003 quarter, was due primarily to increased corporate spending offset by a reduction in net interest expense.
