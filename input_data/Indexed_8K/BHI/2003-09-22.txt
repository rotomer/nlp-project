EXHIBIT 99.1 [BAKER HUGHES LOGO] Contacts: Baker Hughes Incorporated Gary R. Flaharty (713) 439-8039 P.O. Box 4740 gary.flaharty@bakerhughes.com Houston, Texas 77210-4740 - ----------------------------- Kyle J. Leak (713) 439-8042 kyle.leak@bakerhughes.com - ------------------------- BAKER HUGHES ANNOUNCES CHARGES AND REVISED OUTLOOK HOUSTON, September 22, 2003 -- Baker Hughes Incorporated (NYSE: BHI; PCX; EBS) announced today it will record charges to income totaling approximately $106 million after tax in the third quarter of 2003 relating to its 30% minority interest in the WesternGeco seismic venture charges announced today by Schlumberger Ltd. The company also announced that it is classifying its Bird Machine division (Bird) as a discontinued operation and expects to record pre-tax charges of approximately $50 million ($40 million after tax), including $20 million after tax for the reversal of its cumulative translation adjustment account related to Bird. In addition, the company is revising its outlook for income from continuing operations to reflect the company's share of the WesternGeco charges, Bird Machine being classified as a discontinued operation, and reduced operational expectations for both WesternGeco and its oilfield operations. WESTERNGECO As a 30% minority interest partner in WesternGeco, Baker Hughes' share of the charges announced today by Schlumberger Ltd. included approximately $90 million after tax related to the impairment of WesternGeco's multi-client seismic library, as well as approximately $16 million after tax related to the further rationalization of WesternGeco's marine seismic fleet. Following is a table detailing the WesternGeco charges. The company's 30% minority interest in WesternGeco represents the company's most significant investment in an affiliate that is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. As a result of the above WesternGeco related charges, the carrying value of the company's equity investment in affiliates will be reduced by approximately $136 million. In addition, as a result of these announced impairments, and after the company's recognition of its proportionate share of the related charges, the company has initiated an evaluation of the remaining carrying value of its investment [BAKER HUGHES LOGO]
in WesternGeco to determine if the remaining carrying value could be further impaired. The company expects to complete this evaluation by the date of its third quarter earnings release. Although the evaluation will not be completed for several weeks, based on preliminary estimates and calculations, the company estimates that the remaining carrying value could be impaired by an amount of between $40 million and $80 million. The company cautions however that the final amount of impairment, if any, could vary significantly from these preliminary estimates. All of the above described impairment charges related to the company's investment in WesternGeco are of a non-cash nature. BIRD MACHINE The company also announced that its Bird division will be reported as a discontinued operation. In connection with this decision, the company expects to record pre-tax restructuring and impairment charges totaling approximately $30 million ($20 million after tax) and expects to write off approximately $20 million (after tax) of the company's cumulative translation adjustment related to Bird. The majority of the charges are expected to be recorded during the third quarter of 2003. Bird is now expected to record an operating loss of approximately $5 to $7 million in the third quarter of 2003. The restructuring charges, impairment adjustments and operating loss will be recorded within the discontinued operations section of the income statement. REVISED OUTLOOK The company has also been informed by WesternGeco that it is now expected to record an operating loss in the third quarter and is therefore updating its outlook for its WesternGeco interest for the three months ended September 30, 2003. Baker Hughes' 30% share of the WesternGeco operational loss is now expected to be between $10 and $15 million before tax as compared to its July 24, 2003 announced outlook of expected breakeven results for the third quarter of 2003. In addition, the company also updated its outlook for its oilfield operations. The company reconfirmed that oilfield operations revenue for the third quarter is expected to be consistent with the sequential and year over year guidance given in the company's July 24, 2003 news release as increases in international revenue offset shortfalls in the Gulf of Mexico where rig activity has remained flat during the third quarter. However, the company expects income from its oilfield operations to be lower due to this geographic mix change. In addition, the company has incurred several non-recurring costs in its oilfield operations in the third quarter of 2003 that contribute to the shortfall. The company has revised its July 24, 2003 outlook of $0.26 to $0.29 for income from continuing operations per share (diluted) for the third quarter of 2003 to reflect the company's share of the WesternGeco charges, (a loss of approximately $0.31 per share); the revised guidance for WesternGeco, (an operating loss between $0.02 per share and $0.03 per share); the classification of Bird as a discontinued operation (adds approximately $0.005 per share); and the revised outlook for income from its oilfield operations. The company now expects a loss from continuing operations per share (diluted) for the third quarter of 2003, of $0.06 to $0.08 per share, excluding any potential impact related to the results of the review of its carrying value of WesternGeco mentioned above.
