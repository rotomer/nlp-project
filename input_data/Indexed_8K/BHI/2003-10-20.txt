In connection with this decision, the company expects to record pre-tax restructuring and impairment charges totaling approximately $27 million ($17 million after tax) and expects to write off approximately $18 million after tax of the company's cumulative translation adjustment related to Bird. In addition, the company expects to record additional pre-tax charges totaling between $5 and $7 million (between $4 and $6 million after tax) before the ultimate sale of Bird. The majority of the charges are expected to be recorded during the third quarter of 2003.
