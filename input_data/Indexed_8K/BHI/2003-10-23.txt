EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Press Release of Baker Hughes Incorporated dated October 23, 2003.

EXHIBIT 99.1 BAKER HUGHES ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER RESULTS HOUSTON, Texas - October 23, 2003. Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHI - NYSE, PCX, EBS) announced today that in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) the loss from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2003 was $59.5 million or $0.18 per share (diluted) compared to income from continuing operations of $88.8 million or $0.26 per share (diluted) for the third quarter of 2002 and $82.9 million or $0.25 per share (diluted) for the second quarter of 2003. The company announced on September 22, 2003, that it had recorded after tax charges totaling $105.9 million or $0.31 per share (diluted) in the third quarter of 2003, related to its 30% minority interest in the WesternGeco seismic venture for the impairment of its multi-client seismic library and rationalization of its marine seismic fleet. In addition, the company completed its evaluation of the carrying value of its investment in WesternGeco and has determined that the investment is impaired. Accordingly, the company recorded an after tax charge of $45.3 million or $0.14 per share (diluted) in the third quarter of 2003, that reduced the carrying value of the company's equity investment in affiliates. The company also recorded an after tax credit of $1.1 million related to the reversal of a restructuring charge recorded in 2000. Third quarter results were impacted by the recent announcement that the company had entered into a definitive agreement with Andritz for the sale of Bird Machine ("Bird"), the remaining operating division of its Process segment. Accordingly, as the company announced on September 22, 2003, the company has classified and is now reporting Bird as a discontinued business for all current and prior periods. On a GAAP basis, the company's net loss for the third quarter of 2003 was $98.8 million or $0.29 per share (diluted) compared to net income of $64.7 million or $0.19 per share (diluted) for the third quarter of 2002 and $81.6 million or $0.24 per share (diluted) for the second quarter of 2003. Operating profit, which is a non-GAAP measure comprised of income from continuing operations excluding the impact of certain identified non-operational items, for the third quarter of 2003 was $90.6 million or $0.27 per share (diluted) compared to $88.8 million or $0.26 per share (diluted) for the third quarter of 2002 and $82.9 million or $0.25 per share (diluted) for the second quarter of 2003. The company believes that operating profit is useful to investors because it is a consistent measure of the underlying results of the company's business. Furthermore, management uses operating profit internally as a measure of the performance of the company's operations. (See Reconciliation of GAAP Results and Operating Results below.) Third quarter results include the favorable impact (approximately $0.02 per share (diluted)) from lowering the company's tax rate on operating profit from 37% to 35% for the 12 months ending December 31, 2003. Revenue for the third quarter of 2003 was $1,338.4 million, up 7.0% compared to $1,251.1 million for the third quarter of 2002, and up 1.8% compared to $1,314.8 million for the second quarter of 2003. Michael E. Wiley, Baker Hughes' Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Our oilfield divisions continued their strong performance in the third quarter with a consolidated operating profit margin in excess of 15% despite disappointing customer spending in the Gulf of Mexico. All other geographic regions met or exceeded our expectations. For the current quarter we expect continued modest improvements in the international markets and flat US activity."
FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY In September 2002, the company's Board of Directors authorized the company to repurchase up to $275.0 million of its common stock. No shares were repurchased during the third quarter of 2003. The company has authorization remaining to purchase up to $153.0 million in stock. During the third quarter of 2003, debt decreased $82.2 million to $1,524.2 million, and cash decreased $19.6 million to $51.4 million. FINANCIAL INFORMATION
