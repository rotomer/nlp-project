EXHIBIT 99.1
Baker Hughes Announces Fourth Quarter and Year End Results
HOUSTON, Texas  February 12, 2004. Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHI  NYSE, PCX, EBS) announced today that in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter 2003 was $106.6 million or $0.32 per diluted share compared to a breakeven fourth quarter in 2002 and a loss of ($59.5) million or ($0.18) per diluted share in the third quarter 2003. Income from continuing operations for the year 2003 was $180.1 million or $0.54 per diluted share compared to $229.6 million or $0.68 per diluted share for the year 2002.
Net income for the fourth quarter 2003 was $101.6 million or $0.30 per diluted share compared to net losses of ($1.5) million or ($0.01) per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2002 and ($98.8) million or ($0.29) per diluted share in the third quarter 2003. Net income for the year 2003 was $128.9 million or $0.38 per diluted share compared to $168.9 million or $0.50 per diluted share for the year 2002.
Operating profit, which is a non-GAAP measure comprised of income from continuing operations excluding the impact of certain identified non-operational items, was $106.6 million or $0.32 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2003 compared to $86.8 million or $0.26 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2002 and $90.6 million or $0.27 per diluted share for the third quarter 2003. Operating profit was $330.2 million or $0.98 per diluted share for the year 2003 compared to $316.4 million or $0.94 per diluted share for the year 2002. The company believes that operating profit is useful to investors because it is a consistent measure of the underlying results of the company's business. Furthermore, management uses operating profit internally as a measure of the performance of the company's operations. Income from continuing operations is reconciled to operating profit in the section titled in this news release.
Reconciliation of GAAP Results and Operating Results
Revenue for the fourth quarter 2003 was $1,439.5 million, up 14% compared to $1,262.6 million for the fourth quarter 2002 and up 8% compared to $1,338.4 million for the third quarter 2003. Revenue for the year 2003 was $5,292.8 million, up 8% compared to $4,901.7 million for 2002.
Michael E. Wiley, Baker Hughes chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Baker Hughes had a solid fourth quarter, though both the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico activity levels were disappointing. Our sequential improvement is due in part to our cost reductions and resource redeployment from these regions to more active growth areas." Mr. Wiley continued, "We expect 2004 will be a year of revenue and earnings growth. Our plans do not contemplate a significant upturn in activity in either the North Sea or the Gulf of Mexico. However, Russia, the Caspian, Latin America and the Middle East are all expected to be more active. All our divisions are planning improved revenue and profitability in what we expect to be a stable pricing environment."
Commenting on the outlook for the first quarter of 2004, Mr. Wiley said, "Our first quarter results will be impacted by the same seasonality that impacted the first quarters of 2002 and 2003. The seasonality is driven primarily by weather and a tendency for large manufacturing orders, particularly for international customers, to ship in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, first quarter 2004 operating profit is expected to improve over the first quarter of 2003 by about 50%."
Financial Flexibility
In September 2002, the company's Board of Directors authorized the company to repurchase up to $275.0 million of its common stock. During the fourth quarter 2003, approximately 3.8 million shares were purchased at an average price of $28.84 per share and retired. In total, the company has purchased approximately 8.1 million shares at a cost of $230.5 million and has authorization remaining to purchase $44.5 million. During the fourth quarter, debt decreased $39.8 million to $1,484.4 million, and cash and shortterm investments increased $47.0 million to $98.4 million.
 
Capital Expenditures
During the fourth quarter, the company revised its reporting procedures relating to certain rental tools and engineering prototype tools. In both cases, amounts that were formerly reported internally as transfers to property are now reported as capital expenditures. In addition, certain rental tool depreciation related to this equipment that had not previously been included in total depreciation and amortization expense is now included in this caption. For 2003, $58.0 million of amounts previously treated as transfers are now reported as capital expenditures and $23.8 million of depreciation expense associated with this equipment is included in total depreciation and amortization expense that results in an increase in EBITDA of $23.8 million for the year 2003 and $23.2 million for the year 2002. EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure (see the section titled in this news release). There is no impact to the income statement or balance sheet as a result of these changes. On the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year 2003, net cash flows from operations will increase by $58.0 million and net cash flows from investing activity will decrease by $58.0 million, with no impact to total net cash flows. Capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization expense by quarter reflecting these changes for 2003, 2002 and 2001 are listed below.

General Outlook  Oilfield Segment: Baker Hughes' expectation regarding its outlook for its oilfield businesses (including, without limitation, the company's oilfield operations and its minority interest in its production and refining process equipment venture), changes in profitability and growth in those businesses and the oil and gas industry are only its forecasts regarding these matters. These forecasts may be substantially different from actual results, which are affected by the following factors: the level of petroleum industry exploration and production expenditures; drilling rig and oil and gas industry manpower and equipment availability; the company's ability to implement and effect price increases for its products and services; the company's ability to control its costs; the availability of sufficient manufacturing capacity and subcontracting capacity at forecasted costs to meet the company's revenue goals; the effect of competition, particularly the ability of the company to introduce new technology on its forecasted schedule and at its forecasted cost; the ability of the company's competitors to capture market share, the company's ability to retain or increase its market share; world economic conditions; the price of, and the demand for, crude oil and natural gas; drilling activity; seasonal and other weather conditions that affect the demand for energy and severe weather conditions that affect exploration and production activities; the legislative and regulatory environment in the United States and other countries in which the company operates; outcome of government and internal investigations; Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
 
("OPEC") policy and the adherence by OPEC nations to their OPEC production quotas; war, military action or extended period of international conflict, particularly involving the United States, Middle East or other major petroleum-producing or consuming regions; any future acts of war, armed conflicts or terrorist activities; civil unrest or in-country security concerns where the company operates; the development of technology by Baker Hughes or its competitors that lowers overall finding and development costs; new laws and regulations that could have a significant impact on the future operations and conduct of all businesses; labor-related actions, including strikes, slowdowns and facility occupations; the condition of the capital and equity markets in general; adverse foreign exchange fluctuations and adverse changes in the capital markets in international locations where the company operates; and the timing of any of the foregoing.
Oilfield Pricing Changes: Baker Hughes' expectations regarding pricing changes for its products and services are only its expectations regarding pricing. Actual pricing changes could be substantially different from the company's expectations, which are affected by many of the factors listed above in "General Outlook  Oilfield Segment," as well as existing legal and contractual commitments to which the company is subject.
Baker Hughes is a leading provider of drilling, formation evaluation, completion and production products and services to the worldwide oil and gas industry.
