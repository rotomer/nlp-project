Baker Hughes Announces Record Fourth Quarter Results
HOUSTON, Texas  February 17, 2005. Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHI  NYSE) announced today that, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter 2004 was $179.8 million or $0.53 per diluted share, compared to $106.0 million or $0.32 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2003 and $137.3 million or $0.41 per diluted share for the third quarter 2004. Income from continuing operations for the year 2004 was $528.2 million or $1.57 per diluted share, compared to $177.9 million or $0.53 per diluted share for the year 2003.
Net income for the fourth quarter 2004 was $179.6 million or $0.53 per diluted share, compared to $101.6 million or $0.30 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2003 and $137.5 million or $0.41 per diluted share for the third quarter 2004. Net income for the year 2004 was $528.6 million or $1.58 per diluted share, compared to $128.9 million or $0.38 per diluted share for the year 2003.
Operating profit, which is a non-GAAP measure comprised of income from continuing operations excluding the impact of certain identified non-operational items, was $179.8 million or $0.53 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2004, compared to $106.0 million or $0.32 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2003 and $137.3 million or $0.41 per diluted share for the third quarter 2004. Operating profit was $528.2 million or $1.57 per diluted share for the year 2004, compared to $328.0 million or $0.98 per diluted share for the year 2003. There were no non-operational items in 2004. The non-operational items in 2003 were impairment and restructuring charges related to our 30% minority interest in WesternGeco, our seismic joint venture, impairment of our investment in WesternGeco and the reversal of a restructuring charge recorded in 2000. The company believes that operating profit is useful to investors because it is a consistent measure of the underlying results of the company's business. Furthermore, management uses operating profit internally as a measure of the performance of the company's operations. Income from continuing operations is reconciled to operating profit in the section titled in this news release.
Reconciliation of GAAP Results and Operating Results
 
Revenue for the fourth quarter 2004 was $1,679.1 million, up 18% compared to $1,428.0 million for the fourth quarter 2003 and up 9% compared to $1,538.1 million for the third quarter 2004. Revenue for the year 2004 was $6,103.8 million, up 16% compared to $5,252.4 million for 2003.
Chad C. Deaton, Baker Hughes chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Baker Hughes had a record fourth quarter. We reported record revenues, profits and operating margins."
Mr. Deaton continued, "2004 was an excellent year for Baker Hughes and we expect 2005 to be an even better year. The oil and natural gas industry has recognized the need to invest to meet consumer demand, offset depletion, rebuild inventories and restore some cushion of productive capacity. We expect that our customers' investments will grow the most in Russia, the Caspian area and in the Middle East and remain strong in North America. Increased raw material and labor costs will present challenges; however, the capital discipline in the service industry over the last few years has laid the foundation for improved profitability in 2005."
Mr. Deaton concluded, "In my first 100 days with Baker Hughes, I have met with a number of our stakeholders. Our employees are enthusiastic, professional and dedicated to executing our Strategic Framework and living our Core Values. Our customers have been pleased with our performance and have helped us identify opportunities for growth. The company is well positioned and I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead."
Financial Flexibility
During the fourth quarter 2004, debt increased $40.9 million to $1,162.3 million, and cash increased $212.2 million to $319.0 million. In the fourth quarter 2004, the company's capital expenditures were $106.0 million, depreciation and amortization was $95.8 million and dividend payments were $38.7 million.

Oilfield Operations
Unless otherwise noted, all comments in this section refer to Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations, excluding WesternGeco. In July 2004, the company announced that it had formed a separate division, Baker Hughes Drilling Fluids, comprised of the oilfield drilling fluids, completion fluids and fluids environmental services businesses that were formerly part of INTEQ. All references to "INTEQ" in this news release refer to drilling and evaluation product lines that now comprise INTEQ unless explicitly specified otherwise.
Fourth quarter 2004 results include approximately $24.8 million of intellectual property license fees recorded as US revenue for Baker Atlas which are not expected to recur.
The following table details the percentage change in revenue in the fourth quarter 2004 compared to the fourth quarter 2003 and third quarter 2004.
Fourth quarter 2004 results include approximately $24.8 million of intellectual property license fees recorded as US revenue for Baker Atlas. Excluding these license fees, Baker Atlas revenues increased 17% compared to the December 2003 quarter and increased 14% compared to the September 2004 quarter; North American revenues increased 16% compared to the December 2003 quarter and increased 11% compared to the September 2004 quarter; Western Hemisphere revenues increased 16% compared to the December 2003 quarter and increased 9% compared to the September 2004 quarter; and total revenues increased 16% compared to the December 2003 quarter and increased 8% compared to the September 2004 quarter.

Revenue for the fourth quarter 2004 increased 18% compared to the fourth quarter 2003 and increased 9% compared to the third quarter 2004. Sequentially, revenues increased at all
 
divisions except Baker Petrolite, which generally has its seasonal peak earnings in the third quarter of each year. In addition to record revenues for our Oilfield Operations, Baker Atlas, Baker Oil Tools, Hughes Christensen, and INTEQ (drilling and evaluation and drilling fluids combined) each had record revenues in the fourth quarter.
Every division reported improved profits in the fourth quarter 2004 compared to the fourth quarter 2003 and every division except Baker Petrolite reported improved profits compared to the third quarter 2004. In addition to record profits for our Oilfield Operations, Baker Atlas, Hughes Christensen and INTEQ (drilling and evaluation and drilling fluids combined) each reported record profits in the fourth quarter 2004.
The non-GAAP measure of pre-tax operating margin, which is operating profit before tax divided by revenue, was 19.0% for the fourth quarter 2004 compared to 15.1% for the fourth quarter 2003 and 16.8% for the third quarter 2004. In addition to record operating margins for our Oilfield Operations, Baker Atlas and INTEQ (drilling and evaluation and drilling fluids combined) each reported record operating margins in the fourth quarter 2004, and every division, except Baker Hughes Drilling Fluids, reported at least double digit operating margins. The operating margin for the year 2004 was 16.9% compared to 14.4% in 2003.
Corporate, Net Interest and Other
Corporate, net interest and other expenses were $71.0 million in the fourth quarter 2004, up $9.3 million from the fourth quarter 2003 and up $0.7 million from the third quarter 2004. The increase in corporate, net interest and other costs compared to the fourth quarter a year ago was primarily due to increased audit, legal and compliance costs, charges incurred that were related to assets retained from the sale of the former Process group, offset partially by lower net interest expense.
Outlook
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. Factors affecting these forward-looking statements are detailed below under the section titled "Forward-Looking Statements" in this news release. These statements do not include the potential impact of any acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, or other transaction that could occur in the future.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
 
The outlook for corporate and other expenses and income from continuing operations per diluted share do not consider the impact from the adoption of the revised FAS 123R, which the company will adopt in the third quarter of 2005. The company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of this accounting standard. If it is adopted on a prospective basis it is expected to reduce income from continuing operations per diluted share by approximately $0.03 for the last six months of 2005.
