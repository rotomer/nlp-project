Exhibit 99.1
Baker Hughes Announces Third Quarter Results
HOUSTON, Texas  October 28, 2005. Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHI  NYSE) today announced that net income for the third quarter of 2005 was $221.9 million or $0.65 per diluted share, up 61% compared to $137.5 million or $0.41 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2004 and up 1% compared to $218.8 million or $0.64 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2005.
Revenue for the third quarter of 2005 was $1,793.3 million, up 17% compared to $1,538.1 million for the third quarter of 2004 and up 1% compared to $1,775.5 million for the second quarter of 2005.
Chad C. Deaton, Baker Hughes chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Baker Hughes and the oil service industry faced significant challenges in the third quarter. Disruptions from the Gulf of Mexico hurricanes negatively impacted our third quarter results by approximately $0.05 per share. Despite the disruptions, we achieved a $0.01 per share sequential increase in net income per share as price increases, productivity improvements, and a lower effective tax rate offset higher raw material costs, labor inflation, and the impact of the Gulf of Mexico hurricanes."
Commenting on current market conditions, Mr. Deaton continued, "Activity increased in every region and challenged our ability to satisfy customer demand. We expect our customers will continue to increase their investment to develop oil and natural gas reserves to meet growing global demand. While the impact of high energy prices on the global economy is always a concern, and may result in brief periods of slower economic growth, we see a strong market continuing through 2006 and into 2007 and we expect to continue to grow revenue, profit, and profit margins."
Mr. Deaton continued, "To meet the demands of this environment we are planning to increase our research and development funding as well as increase capital spending next year as we deploy additional technologies and services that create value for our customers. We have accelerated investment in training for both our new and current employees to further our goal of flawless execution at the well site. To fund these programs and offset other rising costs we are continuing to push for fair pricing across all divisions."
Mr. Deaton concluded, "In closing I want to acknowledge once again the employees of Baker Hughes for their ongoing dedication and professionalism. I am particularly proud of the way
 
they worked together to help their fellow employees who had their lives impacted by hurricanes Katrina and Rita. We once again demonstrated that it is our people that make the difference at Baker Hughes."
During the third quarter of 2005, debt increased $5.9 million to $1,098.6 million, and cash increased $264.8 million to $742.1 million. In the third quarter of 2005, the company's capital expenditures were $119.8 million, depreciation and amortization was $97.4 million and dividend payments were $39.1 million. On October 27, 2005 the company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a dividend in the amount of $0.13 per share to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2005, representing an increase from prior dividends of $0.115 per share.
In September 2002, the company's Board of Directors authorized the company to repurchase up to $275.0 million of its common stock. During the third quarter of 2005, the company did not repurchase any shares. In total, the company has repurchased approximately 8.1 million shares at a cost of $230.5 million. On October 27, 2005 the company also announced that the Board of Directors authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $455.5 million of its common stock from time to time. The company now has authorization remaining to repurchase up to $500.0 million in stock.

North American revenue increased 21% in the third quarter of 2005 compared to the third quarter of 2004, and increased over 1% sequentially compared to the second quarter of 2005. Our revenue in the third quarter of 2005 was negatively impacted by delays in customer activity in the Gulf of Mexico due to Hurricanes Dennis, Katrina and Rita, and positively impacted by increased customer activity in Canada and on land in the United States. All divisions had increased revenue in the third quarter of 2005 compared to the third quarter of 2004. Revenue at three divisions, Baker Atlas, Baker Hughes Drilling Fluids, and Baker Oil Tools, all heavily exposed to the Gulf of Mexico, was sequentially lower while the impact of the hurricanes was offset by higher land-based revenue at Baker Petrolite, Centrilift, Hughes Christensen, and INTEQ. Highlights included:
Latin American revenue increased 10% in the third quarter of 2005 compared to the third quarter of 2004 and were flat sequentially compared to the second quarter of 2005. Revenue in the third quarter was negatively impacted by decreased customer activity in Venezuela where the rig count declined sequentially compared to the second quarter of 2005. Highlights included:

Russia, CIS, and Caspian revenue was down 19% in the third quarter of 2005 compared to the third quarter of 2004, primarily related to lower sales of ESP systems by Centrilift. Highlights included:
Middle East and Asia Pacific revenue was up 17% in the third quarter of 2005, compared to the third quarter of 2004. Middle East revenue was up 33% in the third quarter of 2005 compared to the third quarter of 2004 and up 9% sequentially compared to the second quarter of 2005. Asia Pacific revenue was up 5% in the third quarter of 2005, compared to the third quarter of 2004 and down 7% sequentially compared to the second quarter of 2005, reflecting lower export sales to China.

Oilfield Operations
Unless otherwise noted, all comments in this section refer to Oilfield Operations which excludes WesternGeco.
The following table details the percentage change in revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2005, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2004 and June 30, 2005.
Revenue for the third quarter of 2005 increased 17% compared to the third quarter of 2004 and increased 1% compared to the second quarter of 2005. Every division increased revenue compared to the third quarter of 2004 and INTEQ, Baker Hughes Drilling Fluids, Hughes Christensen and Centrilift increased revenue compared to the second quarter of 2005. INTEQ, Baker Hughes Drilling Fluids, Hughes Christensen and Centrilift all reported record revenue in the third quarter of 2005.
Every division reported improved profits in the third quarter of 2005 compared to the third quarter of 2004. INTEQ and Hughes Christensen reported record operating profits in the third quarter of 2005.
The non-GAAP measure of pre-tax operating margin, which is operating profit before tax divided by revenue, was 20.5% for the third quarter of 2005 compared to 16.8% for the third quarter of 2004 and 19.9% for the second quarter of 2005. INTEQ and Hughes Christensen reported record pre-tax operating margins in the third quarter of 2005, and every division except Baker Hughes Drilling Fluids, reported double digit pre-tax operating margins.
 
Corporate, Net Interest and Other
Corporate, net interest and other expenses were $68.6 million in the third quarter of 2005, down $1.7 million from the third quarter of 2004 and up $3.9 million from the second quarter of 2005. The decrease in corporate, net interest and other expenses compared to the third quarter a year ago was primarily due to lower costs related to retained assets and liabilities from the Baker Process segment and lower net interest costs offset by higher corporate spending and unfavorable changes in foreign currency. Compared to the second quarter of 2005, the increase was primarily due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency and higher corporate spending offset by lower costs related to retained assets and liabilities from the Baker Process segment.
