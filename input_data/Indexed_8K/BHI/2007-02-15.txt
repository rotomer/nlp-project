Exhibit 99.1
HOUSTON, Texas  February 15, 2007. Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHI  NYSE; EBS) today announced that income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter 2006 was $326.2 million or $1.02 per diluted share compared to $257.4 million or $0.75 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2005 and $358.6 million or $1.09 per diluted share for the third quarter 2006. Income from continuing operations for the year 2006 was $2,398.6 million or $7.21 per diluted share, compared to $874.4 million or $2.56 per diluted share for the year 2005.
Net income for the fourth quarter 2006 was $326.2 million or $1.02 per diluted share compared to $257.9 million or $0.75 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2005 and $358.6 million or $1.09 per diluted share for the third quarter 2006. Net income for the year 2006 was $2,419.0 million or $7.27 per diluted share, compared to $878.4 million or $2.57 per diluted share for the year 2005.
The company has determined that its previously disclosed settlement negotiations with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice are likely to result in a resolution of the investigations, first disclosed in 2002 and 2003, arising from activities in Angola, Kazakhstan and Nigeria. The company's best estimate of the associated financial charge of approximately $46 million before tax ($38.5 million after tax or approximately $0.12 per diluted share) was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006 and is included in Selling, General and Administrative expenses. In addition, fourth quarter results were favorably impacted by a change in accounting procedures related to certain inventory of its Baker Atlas division. The pretax impact of this change was a $21.2 million reduction to cost of revenues.
Operating profit, which is a non-GAAP measure comprised of income from continuing operations excluding the impact of certain identified items, was $1,363.4 million or $4.10 per diluted share for the year 2006 compared to $874.4 million or $2.56 per diluted share for the year 2005. The only identified item in 2006 relates to the pre-tax gain of $1,743.5 million ($1,035.2 million after tax), recorded as a gain on the sale of our interest in an affiliate, our 30% interest in our WesternGeco seismic joint venture with Schlumberger Limited, to Schlumberger
 
on April 28, 2006 for $2.4 billion in cash. There were no other identified items in the first, third or fourth quarters of 2006 or any quarter of 2005. Income from continuing operations is reconciled to operating profit in the section titled "Reconciliation of GAAP and Operating Profit" in this news release.
Revenue for the fourth quarter 2006 was $2,452.7 million, up 23% compared to $1,989.4 million for the fourth quarter 2005 and up 6% compared to $2,309.4 million for the third quarter 2006. Revenue for the year 2006 was $9,027.4 million, up 26% compared to $7,185.5 million for the year 2005.
Chad C. Deaton, Baker Hughes chairman and chief executive officer said, "Baker Hughes achieved record revenue and record operating income in 2006. Our operating profit before tax margin was the highest in our history reflecting continued strong global demand for our products and services. At year end we had a strong balance sheet and unprecedented financial flexibility. Our region management approach is reaping benefits as we capture international growth complementing our product-line divisions and segment structure.
"Both segments reported record revenue, operating profit and operating profit margins. Investments in new technology have resulted in revenue and profit growth at INTEQ and we expect Baker Atlas' growth to benefit from increased investment in people and equipment as 2007 unfolds. Baker Oil Tools has brought on new capacity in Louisiana and the UK, has broken ground on a new manufacturing facility in Dubai, and is making progress in restoring its ability to respond to short lead time orders.
"Global demand for oil and gas continues to grow as the world economy adjusts to higher energy prices. We believe that our customers will increase their overall spending dedicated to finding, developing and producing oil and gas around the world through the end of the decade. Our belief in the expected growth in the market outside North America in 2007 has been reinforced with major contract awards in Brazil, India and Saudi Arabia and significant planned activity increases in Algeria, Italy, Libya, Malaysia, Qatar, and Russia. Accordingly, we increased our capital spending, added approximately 5,500 employees and accelerated our training programs in 2006 to meet the demands we expect in 2007 and beyond. With several weeks remaining in the North American winter, the near term activity outlook for gas-directed drilling remains uncertain. We are encouraged by recent strong withdrawals from gas storage and remain convinced that the rebalancing of the North American natural gas market, if required, can happen relatively quickly."
During the fourth quarter of 2006, debt decreased $6.0 million to $1,075.1 million, and cash and short-term investments decreased $237.9 million to $1,103.7 million. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the company's capital expenditures were $320.6 million, depreciation and amortization was $118.0 million and dividend payments were $41.4 million. For the year 2006, capital expenditures were $922.2 million and depreciation and amortization expense was $433.7 million compared to $478.3 million and $382.4 million in 2005, respectively.
During the fourth quarter of 2006, the company repurchased 3.4 million shares of common stock at an average price of $69.89 for a total of $234.8 million. During 2006, the company repurchased 24.3 million shares of common stock at an average price of $76.50 for a total of $1.86 billion. As of December 31, 2006, the company had authorization remaining to repurchase approximately $345.5 million in common stock.

Reconciliation of GAAP and Operating Profit
The following table reconciles GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and operating profits for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 referenced in this news release. There were no identified items in the first, third or fourth quarters of 2006 or any quarter of 2005.
Operating profit before tax and operating profit after tax are non-GAAP measures comprised of income from continuing operations excluding the impact of certain identified items. The item in the second quarter of 2006 related to the pre-tax gain of $1,743.5 million ($1,035.2 million after tax) from the sale of our 30% interest in WesternGeco, our seismic joint venture with Schlumberger Limited, to Schlumberger on April 28, 2006 for $2.4 billion in cash. The company believes that operating profit is useful to investors because it is a consistent measure of the underlying results of the company's business. Furthermore, management uses operating profit internally as a measure of the performance of the company's operations. Income from continuing operations is reconciled to operating profit in this section of this news release. Reconciliation of GAAP and operating profits for historical periods can be found on the company's website at .
