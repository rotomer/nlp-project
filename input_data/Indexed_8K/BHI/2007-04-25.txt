     99.1  News Release of Baker Hughes Incorporated dated April 26, 2007.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
     HOUSTON, Texas  April 25, 2007. Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHI  NYSE; EBS) today announced that income from continuing operations for the first quarter 2007 was $374.7 million or $1.17 per diluted share compared to $318.8 million or $0.93 per diluted share for the first quarter 2006 and $326.2 million or $1.02 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2006.
     Net income for the first quarter 2007 was $374.7 million or $1.17 per diluted share compared to $339.2 million or $0.99 per diluted share for the first quarter 2006 and $326.2 million or $1.02 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2006.
     Revenue for the first quarter 2007 was $2,472.8 million, up 20% compared to $2,062.0 million for the first quarter 2006 and up 1% compared to $2,452.7 million for the fourth quarter 2006.
     Chad C. Deaton, Baker Hughes chairman and chief executive officer said, "Our profitability increased sequentially in the quarter due to recent actions taken to improve near term results. North America revenues were up 3% despite a weaker than expected rig count in Canada. Outside North America revenue reflected continued activity expansion offset by the seasonal decline in direct sales and Russia/CIS activity.
     "In North America a colder than normal late-January and February has resulted in U.S. natural gas storage levels that, while higher than the recent 5-year average, are lower than previously expected. U.S. gas-directed drilling activity appears to be sufficient to satisfy modest growth in natural gas demand in the short term but may be insufficient to offset decreases in imports from Canada and the decline in the productivity of reservoirs being developed over the longer term. The company's additions in North
 
America have been tempered to more closely match our expectations for slower near term growth and have resulted in improved margins. We will continue to monitor the North America market closely and will make additional adjustments, if necessary, while exercising care not to sacrifice our ability to respond to increased activity levels in the future.
     "The global oil market remains strong and Baker Hughes is well positioned to benefit from increased drilling and completion activity around the world. We are focused on margin improvement in 2007 while maintaining the investment in people, technology and infrastructure necessary to respond to the increased demand for our products and services outside of North America, particularly in Brazil, Northern Africa, the Middle East, Russia and India."
     During the first quarter 2007, debt increased $6.2 million to $1,081.3 million, and cash and short-term investments decreased $187.7 million to $916.0 million. In the first quarter 2007, the company's capital expenditures were $262.0 million, depreciation and amortization was $119.8 million and dividend payments were $41.5 million.
     The company did not repurchase any shares of common stock during the first quarter of 2007 and as of March 31, 2007, the company had authorization remaining to repurchase approximately $345.5 million in common stock.
