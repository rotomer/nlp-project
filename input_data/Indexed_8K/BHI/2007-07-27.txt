99.1       News Release of the Company dated July 27, 2007.

 
Exhibit 99.1
Baker Hughes Announces Second Quarter Results
     HOUSTON, Texas  July 27, 2007. Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHI  NYSE; EBS) today announced that net income for the second quarter 2007 was $349.6 million or $1.09 per diluted share compared to $1,395.0 million or $4.14 per diluted share for the second quarter 2006 and $374.7 million or $1.17 per diluted share for the first quarter 2007.
     Operating profit, which is a non-GAAP measure comprised of income from continuing operations excluding the impact of certain identified items, was $349.6 million or $1.09 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2007 compared to $359.8 million or $1.07 per diluted share for the second quarter 2006 and $374.7 million or $1.17 per diluted share for the first quarter 2007. The operating profit for the second quarter of 2006 excludes the pre-tax gain of $1,743.5 million ($1,035.2 million after-tax) from the sale of our 30% interest in WesternGeco in April 2006 for $2.4 billion in cash. There were no other items identified for exclusion in calculating operating profit in the first or second quarter of 2007 or any other quarter of 2006. Income from continuing operations is reconciled to operating profit in the section titled "Reconciliation of GAAP and Operating Profit" in this news release.
     The results for the second quarter of 2007 include $9.3 million ($0.03 per diluted share) of additional taxes and related interest and penalties associated with disallowed tax deductions, taken in previous years, arising from the previously announced resolution of investigations with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice.
     Revenue for the second quarter 2007 was $2,537.5 million, up 15% compared to $2,203.3 million for the second quarter 2006 and up 3% compared to $2,472.8 million for the first quarter 2007.
 
     Chad C. Deaton, Baker Hughes chairman and chief executive officer said, "A 21% year-over-year increase in revenue in the second quarter from outside North America was partially offset by weaker activity in Canada and the U.S. offshore market. Net income in the quarter was impacted by lower profit from our Drilling and Evaluation business in Canada. In response to the weakness in Canada, we have adjusted our staffing levels, relocating key personnel to markets which are showing better prospects for near-term growth while preserving our ability to respond to future increases in customer spending.
     "In North America, we expect drilling to remain at or near current levels but there are a number of factors that could drive short-term volatility. We believe that any correction in drilling activity due to economic or weather events will unmask the impact of the high decline rates of U.S. natural gas production and that the market will rebalance.
     "We believe that we are experiencing a multi-year expansion in oil and gas exploration, completion and production expenditures, particularly outside of North America. Baker Hughes will continue to invest in the people, technology and infrastructure necessary to support this expansion. Our company has made good progress over the past two years in our targeted countries through the introduction of new technologies, improvement of our reliability and execution, and implementation of our regional organization. We are, however, not satisfied with the incremental profits we delivered in the second quarter, and we are focused on improving our productivity and efficiency while enhancing our ability to grow both the top and bottom line."
     During the second quarter 2007, debt decreased $7.5 million to $1,073.8 million, and cash and short-term investments decreased $76.2 million to $839.8 million. In the second quarter 2007, the company's capital expenditures were $276.4 million, depreciation and amortization was $126.1 million and dividend payments were $41.6 million.
     During the second quarter of 2007, the company repurchased 1.2 million shares of common stock at an average price of $82.26 per share for a total of $98.8 million. On July 26, 2007 the company's Board of Directors authorized a plan to repurchase $1 billion of the company's common stock in addition to the existing stock repurchase plan. As of July 26, 2007, the company had authorization remaining to repurchase approximately $1.212 billion of common stock.

Segment Highlights
     We report our operating results under two segments: Drilling and Evaluation, and Completion and Production.

Historical information on these segments from the first quarter of 2001 through the second quarter of 2007 can be found on our website at www.bakerhughes.com/investor in the "investor relations/financial information" section.
     Operational highlights for the three months ended June 30, 2007, June 30, 2006 and March 31, 2007 are detailed below. All results are unaudited and shown in millions.

     The following table details the percentage change in revenue in the second quarter 2007 compared to the second quarter 2006 and first quarter 2007.
 
     Oilfield Operations revenue was up 15% in the second quarter of 2007 compared to the second quarter of 2006, and up 3% sequentially compared to the first quarter of 2007. Operating profit before tax was up 11% compared to the second quarter of 2006 and down 3% sequentially compared to the first quarter of 2007. The quarterly year-over-year incremental pre-tax margin (a non-GAAP measure of the change in operating profit before tax divided by the change in revenue) was 17%. The pre-tax operating margin (a non-GAAP measure of operating profit before tax divided by revenue) in the
 
second quarter of 2007 was 23% compared to 24% in the second quarter of 2006 and 25% in the first quarter of 2007.
Drilling and Evaluation
     Drilling and Evaluation revenue was up 14% in the second quarter of 2007 compared to the second quarter of 2006, and down 1% sequentially compared to the first quarter of 2007. Segment revenue was impacted by decreases in customer activity in Canada and in the U.S. offshore compared to both the second quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2007. Results for Baker Hughes Drilling Fluids were impacted by changes in their product mix and share losses in certain markets. At Baker Atlas, significant increases in international revenue offset weaker wireline sales in North America. Operating profit before tax in the second quarter of 2007 was up 13% compared to the second quarter of 2006 and down 10% sequentially compared to the first quarter of 2007. The quarterly year-over-year incremental pre-tax margin was 24%. The pre-tax operating margin in both the second quarter of 2007 and 2006 was 26%, compared to 28% in the first quarter of 2007. Segment operating profit in the second quarter of 2007 was negatively impacted by an increase in repair and maintenance costs at INTEQ of approximately $10.0 million compared to the first quarter of 2007.
Completion and Production
     Completion and Production revenue was up 16% in the second quarter of 2007 compared to the second quarter of 2006 and up 6% sequentially compared to the first quarter of 2007.

The pre-tax operating margin in the second quarter of 2007 was 21% compared to 23% in the second quarter of 2006 and 21% in the first quarter of 2007.
Corporate and Other
     Corporate and other expense was up $8.8 million in the second quarter of 2007 compared to the second quarter of 2006 due primarily to an increase in headcount and related expenses. Sequentially, from the first quarter of 2007, corporate and other expense was up $5.5 million due primarily to unfavorable foreign exchange.
