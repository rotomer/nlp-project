On March 3, 2008, Baker Hughes Incorporated (the "Company") initiated a commercial paper program (the "Program") under which the Company may issue from time to time unsecured commercial paper notes (the "Notes") up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $500 million. To the extent the Company has outstanding commercial paper under the Program, the Company's ability to borrow under its $500 million committed revolving credit facility will be reduced. The proceeds of the Program will be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases. Commercial paper issued under the Program is scheduled to mature within 270 days of issuance. The commercial paper is not redeemable prior to maturity and will not be subject to voluntary prepayment. The commercial paper is unsecured and issued on a private placement exempt from registration under the federal and state securities laws. The commercial paper constitutes a direct financial obligation of the Company. As of March 5, 2008, the Company has issued an aggregate of approximately $100 million of Notes under the Program.
