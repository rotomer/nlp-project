Notes to Revenue and Operating Profit Before Tax by Region
1  Operating profit before tax is a non-GAAP measures comprised of income from continuing operations excluding the impact of certain identified non-operational items. The company believes that operating profit is useful to investors because it is a consistent measure of the underlying results of the company's business. Furthermore, management uses operating profit internally as a measure of the performance of the company's operations. Income from continuing operations before tax is reconciled to operating profit before tax in the table below. Reconciliation of GAAP and operating profits for historical periods can be found on the company's website at www.bakerhughes.com/investor.
The non-operational item in the second quarter of 2006 and the year ended December 31, 2006 related to the pre-tax gain of $1,743.5 million ($1,035.2 million after tax) from the sale of our 30% interest in WesternGeco, our seismic joint venture with Schlumberger, to Schlumberger on April 28, 2006 for $2.4 billion in cash.
There were no non-operational items in any other period between Quarter 1 2005 and Quarter 1 2008.
2  Quarter 4 2005 results for Completion and Production include a $5.1 million write-off of in-process research and development associated with the acquisition of the remaining interest in QuantX. The impact on the region operating profit was: North America: $2.1 million; Europe Africa Russia and the Caspian: $3.0 million.
3  Our 30% minority interest in WesternGeco was sold to Schlumberger on April 28, 2006.
4  Fourth quarter 2006 results were favorably impacted by a change in accounting procedures related to certain inventory of our Baker Atlas division. The pretax impact of this change was a $21.2 million reduction to cost of services and rentals. The full amount is reflected in Drilling and Evaluation operating profit. The impact on the region operating profit was: North America: $7.5 million; Latin America: $2.6 million; Europe Africa Russia and the Caspian: $6.4 million; Middle East, Asia Pacific: $4.7 million.
5  Fourth quarter 2006 results included a financial charge of approximately $46 million before tax ($38.5 million after tax or approximately $0.12 per diluted share) associated with the likely resolution of the investigations by the Securities and Exchange
 
Commission and Department of Justice into activities in Angola, Kazakhstan and Nigeria.
6  2007 results were favorably impacted by an increase in the depreciable lives of certain assets of our Baker Atlas division. The pretax impact of this change was approximately $6.0 million reduction to cost of services and rentals per quarter.
