Notes to Revenue and Operating Profit Before Tax by Region
1  Operating profit before tax is a non-GAAP measures comprised of income from continuing operations excluding the impact of certain identified non-operational items. The company believes that operating profit is useful to investors because it is a consistent measure of the underlying results of the company's business. Furthermore, management uses operating profit internally as a measure of the performance of the company's operations. Income from continuing operations before tax is reconciled to operating profit before tax in the table below. Reconciliation of GAAP and operating profits for historical periods can be found on the company's website at www.bakerhughes.com/investor.
The non-operational item in the second quarter of 2006 and the year ended December 31, 2006 related to the pre-tax gain of $1,743.5 million ($1,035.2 million after tax) from the sale of our 30% interest in WesternGeco, our seismic joint venture with Schlumberger, to Schlumberger on April 28, 2006 for $2.4 billion in cash.
There were no non-operational items in any other period between Quarter 1 2005 and Quarter 1 2008.
