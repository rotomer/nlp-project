Exhibit 99.1
News Release
Baker Hughes Announces Fourth Quarter and Annual Results
HOUSTON, Texas  January 28, 2009. Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHI  NYSE) today announced that net income for the fourth quarter 2008 was $432 million or $1.41 per diluted share compared to $401 million or $1.26 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2007 and $429 million or $1.39 per diluted share for the third quarter 2008. Net income for the year 2008 was $1.64 billion or $5.30 per diluted share, compared to $1.51 billion or $4.73 per diluted share for the year 2007.
Revenue for the fourth quarter 2008 was $3.19 billion, up 16% compared to $2.74 billion for the fourth quarter 2007 and up 6% compared to $3.01 billion for the third quarter 2008. Revenue for the year 2008 was $11.86 billion, up 14% compared to $10.43 billion for the year 2007. Revenue from North America increased 17% and revenue from outside North America increased 12% for the year 2008 compared to the year 2007.
Results for the fourth quarter 2008 include an impairment of auction rate securities of $25 million after-tax ($0.08 per diluted share).
Chad C. Deaton, Baker Hughes chairman, president and chief executive officer said, "Fourth quarter results were particularly strong in the Western Hemisphere despite the global economic slowdown and eroding commodity prices. In North America, service-intensive horizontal drilling remained strong and our completion and production business posted solid results. Revenue increases in Brazil and Colombia led a strong quarter in Latin America. In the Europe Africa Russia Caspian region, weakening of local currencies against the US dollar, a declining Russian market, as well as weather- and project-related delays in the North Sea and Nigeria impacted our results. Sequentially, Middle East Asia Pacific region revenue increases were led
 
by strong results from Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and Egypt. For the company as a whole, operating margins were stable and in line with the previous quarters of 2008.
"Looking forward, the outlook for 2009 has continued to deteriorate. The global economic recession, lower oil prices, and reduced access to credit will negatively impact customer spending globally. Many of our international customers are trimming their exploration plans, giving priority to spending on production & development. In North America, where the US rig count has already fallen 25% from peak, customers are continuing to reduce their budgets to address an oversupplied gas market. The depth and duration of the cycle remains uncertain, dependent in part on the timing of the recovery of the global economy.
"We continue to believe that in the long-term the industry will be challenged to offset production declines. When the economy recovers, we expect the demand for energy and the demand for our technology and services will recover in parallel. We will continue to invest in research and engineering, employee development, and in the infrastructure we will need to exit this cycle a stronger competitor in all our markets. That said, we have taken actions to address this downturn and will make further adjustments to our cost structure as conditions dictate."
During the fourth quarter 2008, debt increased $703 million to $2.33 billion and cash and short-term investments increased $828 million to $1.96 billion as compared to the third quarter 2008. The company issued $1.25 billion in long-term debt and repaid approximately $500 million in commercial paper in the fourth quarter 2008. In the first quarter 2009, the company intends to repay approximately $525 million of maturing long-term debt. The next maturities of long-term debt amounting to $500 million are due in November 2013. In the fourth quarter 2008, the company's capital expenditures were $463 million, depreciation and amortization expense was $177 million and dividend payments were $47 million. For the year 2008, capital expenditures were $1.30 billion and depreciation and amortization expense was $637 million compared to $1.13 billion and $521 million in 2007, respectively.
During the fourth quarter 2008, the company repurchased 380,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $42.67 per share for a total of $16 million. At the end of 2008, the company had authorization remaining to repurchase approximately $1.20 billion in common stock.

Revenue and Profit Before Tax by Segment and Region
We report our results under two segments, Drilling and Evaluation and Completion and Production, and under four geographic regions. Operational highlights for the three months ended December 31, 2008, December 31, 2007, and September 30, 2008, are detailed below. All results are unaudited and shown in millions.
 
Operational highlights for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 are detailed below. All results are unaudited and shown in millions.
The following sections include a calculation of pre-tax operating margin. Pre-tax operating margin is a non-GAAP measure defined as profit before tax ("income before income taxes") divided by revenue. Management uses the pre-tax operating margin because it believes it is a widely accepted financial indicator used by investors and analysts to analyze and compare companies on the basis of operating performance and that this measurement may be used by investors to make informed investment decisions.

The growth in revenue in the fourth quarter 2008 compared to the fourth quarter 2007 was led by sales of completion equipment in the Gulf of Mexico and artificial lift systems on land. Increased horizontal drilling activity for unconventional gas drove growth for high temperature and conventional directional drilling, measurement-while-drilling, logging-while-drilling and FracPoint completion systems compared to the fourth quarter 2007. Sequential improvement in the fourth quarter 2008 compared to the third quarter 2008 was driven by the recovery of activity
 
in the Gulf of Mexico following the third quarter 2008 hurricanes, as well as our completion, wireline, directional drilling and drilling fluids product lines and was supported by steady performance from our production-oriented production chemicals and artificial lift product lines.
Profit before tax in the fourth quarter 2008 was up 14% compared to the fourth quarter 2007 and up 5% compared to the third quarter 2008. The pre-tax operating margin in the fourth quarter 2008 was 23% compared to 26% in the fourth quarter 2007 and 24% in the third quarter 2008.

Comparing the fourth quarter 2008 to the third quarter 2008, improvement was led by seasonal sales of artificial lift systems in Brazil and Colombia and strong sales of completion and production equipment in Venezuela, Colombia and Mexico.

Sequentially, compared to the third quarter 2008, fourth quarter 2008 revenue increases were driven by increased directional drilling, measurement- while-
 
drilling, logging-while-drilling, completions and oilfield chemicals revenue primarily in Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Egypt.
