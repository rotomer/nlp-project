The representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement may have been made to allocate risks among the parties thereto, including where the parties do not have complete knowledge of all facts, instead of establishing matters as facts. Furthermore, those representations and warranties may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. The assertions embodied in such representations and warranties are qualified by information contained in disclosure letters to the Merger Agreement that the parties exchanged in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement.

Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of such representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company's or BJ Services' public disclosures.
The Merger Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
