On September 4, 2009, an additional purported stockholder class action lawsuit styled , was filed in the Delaware Chancery Court on behalf of the public stockholders of BJ Services naming BJ Services, the current members of the BJ Services Board, the Company and Merger Sub as defendants.
Myers v. BJ Services, et al.
In the actions the plaintiffs allege, among other things, that the members of the BJ Services Board breached their fiduciary duties by failing to properly value BJ Services, failing to take steps to maximize the value of BJ Services to its public stockholders, and avoiding a competitive bidding process. The actions each allege that the Company aided and abetted the purported breaches by the BJ Services Board. The plaintiffs in each lawsuit seek, among other things, injunctive relief with respect to the Merger.
The Company believes that each lawsuit is without merit and intends to vigorously defend each action. Because the lawsuits are at an early stage, the Company cannot predict the manner and timing of the resolution of the lawsuits or their outcomes.
