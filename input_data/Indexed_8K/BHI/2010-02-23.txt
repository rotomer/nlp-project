     Section 1. . The Board of Directors shall consist of 11(13*) directors. No officer of the Corporation may serve on a board of directors of any company having a present or retired employee on the Corporation's Board of Directors. No person associated with an organization whose services are contracted by the Corporation shall serve on the Corporation's Board of Directors; provided, however, that a majority of the Whole Board may waive this prohibition if the Board in its judgment determines that such waiver would be in the best interest of the Corporation. The term "Whole Board", where used in these Bylaws, refers to the 11 (13*) authorized directorships constituting the Board of Directors whether or not there exist any vacancies.
Number and Qualification of Directors
     Section 2. . Each Director shall be elected for a term of one year and shall hold office until such director's successor is elected and qualified or until his earlier death, retirement, resignation or removal.
Election and Term of Office
     Section 3. . No person who is concurrently a director and an employee of the Corporation shall be qualified to serve as a director of the Corporation from and after the time of any diminution in such person's duties or responsibilities as an officer, the time they leave the employ of the Corporation for any reason or their 72nd birthday; provided, however, that if any such person resigns from the Board of Directors upon such event, such person shall thereafter be deemed qualified to serve as a director of the Corporation for so long as such person is otherwise qualified to so serve pursuant to the following sentence. No person shall be qualified to serve as a director of the corporation on or after the date of the annual meeting of stockholders following: (i) his 72nd birthday or (ii) any fiscal year in which he has failed to attend at least 66% of the meetings of the Board of Directors and any committees of the Board of Directors on which such director serves, provided that such

a person shall be deemed to be qualified to serve as a director if so determined by a majority of the Whole Board (excluding the director whose resignation would otherwise be required) if the Board of Directors in its judgment determines that such waiver would be in the best interest of the Corporation.
     Any nominee for director in an uncontested election who receives a "withhold" vote representing a majority of the votes cast for his or her election will be required to submit a letter of resignation to the Governance Committee of the Board of Directors. The Governance Committee will consider all of the relevant facts and circumstances and recommend to the Board of Directors whether or not the resignation should be accepted. For the purposes of this Section, an "uncontested election" shall mean an election in which the number of nominees as of the record date for the meeting at which directors are to be elected does not exceed the number of directors to be elected at such meeting.
     Any director may be removed with or without cause by the holders of a majority of the shares of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors. The Board of Directors may not remove any director with or without cause, and no recommendation by the Board of Directors that a director be removed with or without cause may be made to the stockholders except by the affirmative vote of not less than 75% of the Whole Board.
     Section 4. . Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock then outstanding and except as otherwise provided by statute or the Certificate of Incorporation, (i) in the case of any increase in the number of directors, such additional director or directors shall be elected by a majority vote of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director (and not by stockholders), or (ii) in the case of any vacancy in the Board of Directors, however created, the vacancy or vacancies shall be filled by a majority vote of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director (and not by stockholders). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence of this Article III, Section 4, if, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office the Board determines that a newly created directorship or vacancy should be filled by the stockholders, the stockholders shall elect a nominee to fill such newly created directorship or vacancy. In the event one or more directors shall resign, effective at a future date, such vacancy or vacancies shall be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective. A director chosen or elected pursuant to this Section 4 shall hold office until the annual meeting next following his election or until his successor is elected and qualified or until his earlier death, retirement, resignation or removal.
Vacancies and Newly Created Directorships
     In the event of any decrease in the authorized number of directors, each director then serving as such shall nevertheless continue as a director until the expiration of his current term, or his prior death, retirement, resignation or removal.

     Section 9. . At all meetings of the Board of Directors a majority of the Whole Board shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the vote of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum, shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present. If only one director is authorized, such sole director shall constitute a quorum.

     Section 12. . The Board of Directors may from time to time designate committees of the Board of Directors, with such lawfully delegable powers and duties as it thereby confers, to serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors and shall, for those committees and any others provided for herein, elect a director or directors to serve as the member or members, designating, if it desires, other directors as alternate members who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of any member of any committee and any alternate member in his or her place, the member or members of the committee present at the meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or she or they constitute a quorum, may by unanimous vote appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of the absent or disqualified member. The Board of Directors shall, by resolution passed by a majority of the Whole Board, designate one member of each committee as chairman of such committee. Each such chairman shall hold such office for a period not in excess of five years, and shall upon surrender of such chairmanship resign from membership on such committee. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority in reference to the following matters: (i) approving or adopting, or recommending to the stockholders, any action or matter expressly required by the Delaware General Corporation Law (other than the election of directors) to be submitted to stockholders for approval or (ii) adopting, amending or repealing any bylaw of the Corporation.

Indemnification
     (b) The Corporation shall indemnify every person who is or was a party or is or was threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was licensed to practice law and an employee (including an employee who is or was an officer) of the Corporation or any of its direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and, while acting in the course of such employment committed or is alleged to have committed any negligent acts, errors or omissions in rendering professional legal services at the request of the Corporation or pursuant to his employment (including, without limitation, rendering written or oral legal opinions to third parties) against expenses (including counsel fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, to the full extent permitted by applicable law; provided that the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any such person against any action, suit or proceeding arising out of any adjudicated criminal, dishonest or fraudulent acts, errors or omissions of such person or any adjudicated willful, intentional or malicious acts, errors or omissions of such person.
 
     (c) The Corporation shall indemnify every person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, or employee of the Corporation, or any of its direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries or, while a director, officer, or employee of the Corporation or any of its direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation or any of its direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, as a director, officer, or employee of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
     (d) To the extent that a director, officer, or employee of the Corporation, or any of its direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this section, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.
     (e) Any indemnification under subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this section (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, or employee is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this section. Such determination shall be made (1) by a majority vote of the directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, (2) by a committee or such directors designated by majority vote of such directors even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (4) by the stockholders. If a claim under this Section 16 is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60 days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be 20 days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) in any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including
 
its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Section 16 or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.
     (f) Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by an present or former officer or director of the Corporation or any of its direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries in defending a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Section 16. Such expenses incurred by other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.
     (g) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Section 16 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any provision of law, the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or other governing documents of any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation, or any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding any of the positions or having any of the relationships referred to in this Section 16.
     (h) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Section 16 shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer or employee and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
     (i) Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Section 16 that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal.
