     (e) As previously reported on a Form 8-K filed on April 1, 2010, Baker Hughes Incorporated (the "") adopted an amendment effective March 31, 2010 to the Baker Hughes Incorporated 2002 Director & Officer Long Term Incentive Plan (the "") to increase the limitation on the number of shares of the Company's common stock available for issuance under the Director and Officer Plan by 3,000,000 shares and extending the period for which awards may be granted under the Director and Officer Plan from March 5, 2012 to September 18, 2019.
Company
Director and Officer Plan
     Also as previously reported on a Form 8-K filed on April 1, 2010, the Company adopted an amendment effective March 31, 2010 to the Baker Hughes Incorporated 2002 Employee Long Term Incentive Plan (the "") to increase the limitation on the number of shares of the Company's common stock available for issuance under the Employee Plan by 12,500,000 shares and extending the period for which awards may be granted under the Employee Plan from March 5, 2012 to September 18, 2019.
Employee Plan
     The amendments also remove the 3,000,000 limitation on the aggregate number of shares of the Company's common stock that may be issued under each of the Director and Officer Plan and the Employee Plan during the terms of the plans in a form other than stock options and instead provide that an award payable in shares of the Company's common stock granted under the plans after March 31, 2010 (other than a stock option or a stock appreciation right) shall count against the overall share limit under both plans as 1.60 shares for every share subject to the award. Shares of the Company's common stock subject to an award in the form of a stock option or a stock appreciation right would continue to count against the overall share limits under the Director and Officer Plan and the Employee Plan as 1.00 share for every share subject to the award.
     The foregoing descriptions of the amendments to the Director and Officer Plan and the Employee Plan do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such amendments, which were included as Annexes G and H, respectively, to the Company's Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 16, 2010, and are incorporated herein by reference.
