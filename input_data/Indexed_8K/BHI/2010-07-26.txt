     3.07 In accordance with procedures established by the Plan Administrator, a Participant or former Participant may make a one-time irrevocable election to change the time and/or form of payment he previously selected for all of the Grandfathered Amounts credited to his Account. Any such change election must be made no later than 18 months before the date on which such amounts were scheduled to be paid or commence to be paid under the Participant's or former Participant's original election. In addition, any such change election may not provide for a payment or commencement of payment that is earlier than 18 months after the date on which the change election is made.

The amount of each such Company Deferral shall be a percentage of the Participant's Ineligible Thrift Plan Compensation, if any, for such payroll period, with such percentage being equal to the percentage utilized under the Thrift Plan to determine the Participant's "Company Base Contribution" for such payroll period under the Thrift Plan.

Company Discretionary Deferrals.
 
     4.05 A Participant who does not have a time and form of payment election in effect pursuant to Section 3.06 for a given Plan Year shall make a time and form of payment election, as provided in Sections 9.03 and 9.05 (Sections 9.02 and 9.04 with respect to Grandfathered Amounts), for Company Base Thrift Deferrals, Company Basic Deferrals, Company Pension Deferrals, and Company Discretionary Deferrals for such Plan Year.

A Participant who had made a time and form of payment election pursuant to this Section 4.05 may change his election for future Company Base Thrift Deferrals, Company Pension Deferrals, and Company Discretionary Deferrals as of the Entry Date of any subsequent Plan Year, by effecting a new election to the Entry Date of such Plan Year, in the form and within the time period prescribed by the Plan Administrator.

     All amounts allocated to the Accounts of a Participant shall be deemed to be invested as of the date of such allocation, and the balance of each Account shall reflect the result of daily pricing of the assets in which such Account is deemed to be invested from the time of such allocation until the time of distribution.
     Participants' and former Participants' Accounts shall be deemed to be credited with earnings and losses. For the purpose of determining the earnings or losses to be credited to the Participant's or former Participant's Accounts under the Plan, the Plan Administrator shall assume that the Participant's or former Participant's Accounts are invested in units or shares of the Funds in the proportions selected by the Participant or former Participant in accordance with procedures established by the Plan Administrator. This amount accrued by the Plan Administrator as additional deferred compensation shall be a part of the Company's obligation to the Participant or former Participant. The determination of deemed earnings and losses on amounts deemed credited to the Participant's or former Participant's Account shall in no way affect the ability of the general creditors of the Company to reach the assets of the Company (including any rabbi trust maintained in connection with the Plan) in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or place the Participants or former Participants in a secured position ahead of the general creditors of the Company. Although a Participant's or former Participant's investment selections made in accordance with the terms of the Plan and such procedures as may be established by the Plan Administrator shall be relevant for purposes of determining the Company's obligation to the Participant or former Participant under the Plan, there is no requirement that any assets of the Company (including those held in any rabbi trust) shall be invested in accordance with the Participant's or former Participant's investment
 
selections.
     Each Participant or former Participant shall designate, in accordance with the procedures established from time to time by the Plan Administrator, the manner in which the amounts allocated to his Accounts shall be deemed to be invested from among the Funds made available from time to time for such purpose by the Plan Administrator. Such Participant or former Participant may designate one of such Funds for the deemed investment of all such amounts allocated to his Accounts or he may split the deemed investment of such amounts allocated to his Accounts among such Funds in such increments as the Plan Administrator may prescribe. If a Participant or former Participant fails to make a proper designation, then his Accounts shall be deemed to be invested in the Fund or Funds designated in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner by the Plan Administrator from time to time.
     A Participant may change his deemed investment designation for future deferrals to be allocated to his Accounts. Any such change shall be made in accordance with the procedures established by the Plan Administrator, and the frequency of such changes may be limited by the Plan Administrator.
     A Participant or former Participant may elect to convert his deemed investment designation with respect to the amounts already allocated to his Accounts. Any such conversion shall be made in accordance with the procedures established by the Plan Administrator, and the frequency of such conversions may be limited by the Plan Administrator.
     7.01 A Participant or former Participant shall have a 100% Vested Interest in amounts credited to his Participant Deferral Account and his Company Basic Deferral Account at all times. A Participant or former Participant shall have a Vested Interest in the amounts credited to his Company Base Thrift Deferral Account and Company Discretionary Deferral Account equal to his nonforfeitable interest in his "Company Non-Matching Accounts" under the Thrift Plan. A Participant or former Participant shall have a Vested Interest in the amounts credited to his Company Pension Deferral Account equal to his nonforfeitable interest in his account under the Pension Plan. Further, a Participant or former Participant shall have a 100% Vested Interest in amounts credited to his Company Base Thrift Deferral Account, Company Pension Deferral Account, and Company Discretionary Deferral Account upon such Participant's or former Participant's Termination of Employment after attainment of his Retirement Date or by reason of death. If a Change in Control occurs, a Participant who has not incurred a Separation From Service prior to the date of the Change in Control shall have a 100% Vested Interest in amounts credited to his Company Base Thrift Deferral Account, Company Discretionary Deferral Account and Company Pension Deferral Account upon the occurrence of the Change in Control.

that is less than 100% (determined after giving effect to any provision in Section 7.01 that may provide for an increase in such Participant's Vested Interest upon a Termination of Employment) shall forfeit to the Company the nonvested portion of amounts credited to his Company Base Thrift Deferral Account, Company Pension Deferral Account, and Company Discretionary Deferral Account as of the date of such Termination of Employment.
     8.01 Except as provided in Section 8.02, or as elected by a Participant pursuant to Section 3.06 or Section 4.05 (as such election may be changed pursuant to Section 3.07 or Section 3.08) Participants shall not be permitted to make withdrawals from, or to receive distributions under, the Plan while they are employed by the Company or an Affiliate. Participants shall not, at any time, be permitted to borrow from the Trust Fund. Except as provided in Sections 8.02 and 14.04, all benefits under the Plan shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Article IX.
Restrictions on In-Service Distributions and Loans.
     8.02 In the event that the Plan Administrator, upon written petition of a Participant who has not incurred a Termination of Employment, determines in its sole discretion that such Participant has suffered an Unforeseeable Financial Emergency, such Participant shall be entitled to a distribution in an amount not to exceed the lesser of (a) the amount determined by the Plan Administrator as necessary to meet such Participant's needs created by the Unforeseeable Financial Emergency or (b) the then value of such Participant's Vested Interest in his Accounts. Such benefit shall be paid in a single lump sum payment as soon as administratively practicable after the Plan Administrator has made its determinations with respect to the availability and amount of such benefit. If a Participant's Accounts are deemed to be invested in more than one Fund, such benefit shall be distributed pro rata from each Fund in which such Accounts are deemed to be invested. If a Participant's Accounts contain more than one distribution subaccount, such benefit shall be considered to have been distributed, first, from the subaccount with respect to which the earliest distribution would be made, then, from the subaccount with respect to which the next earliest distribution would be made, and continuing in such manner until the amount of such distribution has been satisfied. A distribution under this Section 8.02 shall in any event be made within 90 days after the Participant incurs an Unforeseeable Financial Emergency. The Participant shall not be permitted to elect the taxable year in which any payment under this Section 8.02 shall be made.
Emergency Benefit.
 
     9.01 Upon the expiration of the Deferral Period, the Participant (or, in the event of the death of the Participant while employed by the Company or an Affiliate, the Participant's designated beneficiary) or former Participant shall be entitled to a benefit equal in value to the Participant's or former Participant's Vested Interest in the balance in his Accounts as of the date the payment of such benefit is to commence pursuant to Section 9.02 and/or Section 9.03 (adjusted for subsequent deemed investment gains or losses in the case of benefits paid in the form of installments).
Amount of Benefit.
     9.02 Payment of a Participant's or former Participant's benefit under Section 9.01 shall be made or shall commence, with respect to such Participant's or former Participant's Accounts, or with respect to such Participant's or former Participant's subaccounts established pursuant to Section 3.06 and/or Section 4.05 separately and respectively, as follows.

To the extent that the Participant or former Participant elected to have his Accounts or subaccounts paid after a specified term, the Participant's or former Participant's benefit shall be paid or commence to be paid as soon as administratively practicable after the expiration of such specified term. With respect to any portion of a Participant's or former Participant's benefit for which no time of payment election is in effect, payment of such amount shall be made or commence as soon as administratively practicable after the last day of the calendar year coincident with or next following the date the Participant or former Participant incurs a Termination of Employment. A Participant's or former Participant's benefit shall not, however, be paid or commence prior to the date that all Participant Deferrals and Company Deferrals made pursuant to the Plan have been allocated to such Participant's or former Participant's Accounts.

Any benefit payments made to a Participant, or former Participant, or for his benefit pursuant to any provision of the Plan shall be debited to such Participant's or former Participant's Accounts. All benefit payments shall be made in cash to the fullest extent practicable.
Payment of Benefits.
     9.10 In the case of a benefit payable on behalf of a Participant or former Participant, if the Plan Administrator is unable, after reasonable efforts, to locate the Participant, the former Participant or the beneficiary to whom such benefit is payable, upon the Plan Administrator's determination thereof, such benefit shall be forfeited to the Company.

If the Plan Administrator notifies the claimant in writing during the initial 90-day period, it may extend the period up to 180 days after the initial receipt of the claim. The written notice must contain the circumstances necessitating the extension and the anticipated date for the final decision. If a claim is denied during the claims period, the Plan Administrator must notify the claimant in writing, and the written notice must set forth in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant:

(4) an explanation of the Plan claims review procedures and time limits, including a statement of the claimant's right to bring a civil action under section 502(a) of ERISA.

     (b) . For purposes of this section the Participant or the person entitled to Benefits under Section 10 is referred to as the "claimant." If a claimant's claim made pursuant to Section 10.08(a) is denied and he wants a review, he must apply to the Plan Administrator in writing. That application can include any arguments, written comments, documents, records, and other information relating to the claim for benefits. In addition, the claimant is entitled to receive on request and free of charge reasonable access to and copies of all information relevant to the claim.

The Plan Administrator must take into account all comments, documents, records, and other information submitted by the claimant relating to the claim, without regard to whether the information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. The claimant may either represent himself or appoint a representative, either of whom has the right to inspect all documents pertaining to the claim and its denial. The Plan Administrator can schedule any meeting with the claimant or his representative that it finds necessary or appropriate to complete its review.

The Plan Administrator may extend the 60-day period where the nature of the benefit involved or other attendant circumstances make such extension appropriate. In connection with such review, the claimant or his or her duly authorized representative may review pertinent documents and may submit issues and comments in writing. The Plan Administrator shall make a decision promptly, and not later than 60 days after the Plan's receipt of a request for review, unless special circumstances (such as the need to hold a hearing) require an extension of time for processing, in which case a decision shall be rendered as

     13.01 The Company intends and desires by the adoption of the Plan to recognize the value to the Company of the past and present services of employees covered by the Plan and to encourage and assure their continued service with the Company by making more adequate provision for their future retirement security. The establishment of the Plan is, in part, made necessary by certain benefit limitations which are imposed on the Thrift Plan and the Pension Plan by the Code. The Plan is intended to constitute an unfunded, unsecured plan of deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees of the Company. Plan benefits herein provided are a contractual obligation of the Company which shall be paid out of the Company's general assets. Nevertheless, subject to the terms hereof and of the Trust Agreement, the Company may transfer money or other property to the Trustee to provide Plan benefits hereunder, and the Trustee shall pay Plan benefits to Participants, former Participants and their beneficiaries out of the Trust Fund. To the extent the Company transfers assets to the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the Plan Administrator may, but need not, establish procedures for the Trustee to invest the Trust Fund in accordance with each Participant's or former Participant's designated deemed investments pursuant to Article VI respecting the portion of the Trust Fund assets equal to such Participant's or former Participant's Accounts.
Nature of the Plan.
 
     13.02 The Board, in its sole discretion, may establish the Trust and direct Baker Hughes, for and on behalf of each Company, to enter into the Trust Agreement.

For purposes hereof, the Company shall be considered "insolvent" if (a) the Company is unable to pay its debts as they become due or (b) the Company is subject to a pending proceeding as a debtor under the United States Bankruptcy Code (or any successor federal statute). The chief executive officer of the Company and its board of directors shall have the duty to inform the Trustee in writing if the Company becomes insolvent. Such notice given under the preceding sentence by any party shall satisfy all of the parties' duty to give notice. When so informed, the Trustee shall suspend payments to the Participants and former Participants and hold the assets for the benefit of the Company's general creditors. If the Company subsequently alleges that it is no longer insolvent or if the Trustee receives a written allegation from a third party that the Company is insolvent, the Trustee shall suspend payments to the Participants and former Participants and hold the Trust Fund for the benefit of the Company's general creditors, and shall determine in accordance with the Trust Agreement whether the Company is insolvent. If the Trustee determines that the Company is not insolvent, the Trustee shall resume payments to the Participants and former Participants. No Participant, former Participant or beneficiary shall have any preferred claim to, or any beneficial ownership interest in, any assets of the Trust Fund, and, upon commencement of participation in the Plan, each Participant and former Participant shall have agreed to waive his priority credit position, if any, under applicable state law with respect to the assets of the Trust Fund.

Amendment and Termination.
