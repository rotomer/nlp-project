(e) Subsequent to the adoption of the respective performance goals for the performance units previously granted in 2009 and 2010 under the 2002 Director & Officer Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "D&O LTIP"), the composition of the peer group established by the Compensation Committee of Baker Hughes Incorporated (the "Compensation Committee") for purposes of measuring the achievement of performance goals under such performance unit awards changed as a result of two corporate mergers and acquisitions in 2010. Under the terms of the performance unit awards and the 2002 D&O LTIP, the Compensation Committee has the authority to make appropriate adjustments to the performance goals in the event of extraordinary events such as mergers and acquisitions. On October 21, 2010, the Compensation Committee adopted revised performance goals for the performance units previously granted in 2009 and 2010 to adjust for a reduced number of companies in the peer group with the value of each performance unit reflecting the smaller peer group.
     On October 21, 2010, the Compensation Committee adopted written performance goals for the performance units to be granted in 2011 under the 2002 D&O LTIP.
     The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the performance goals for the performance unit awards granted in 2009, the performance goals for the performance unit awards granted in 2010 and the performance goals for the performance unit awards to be granted in 2011, attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3.
     10.1 Performance Goals adopted October 21, 2010 for the Performance Unit Awards Granted in 2009 under the Baker Hughes Incorporated 2002 Director & Officer Long-Term Incentive Plan.
     10.2 Performance Goals adopted October 21, 2010 for the Performance Unit Awards Granted in 2010 under the Baker Hughes Incorporated 2002 Director & Officer Long-Term Incentive Plan.
     10.3 Performance Goals adopted October 21, 2010 for the Performance Unit Awards to be Granted in 2011 under the Baker Hughes Incorporated 2002 Director & Officer Long-Term Incentive Plan.

1. 2009 Performance Unit Program.
     The Performance Unit Program, a component compensation program established under each of the Baker Hughes Incorporated 2002 Director & Officer Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Baker Hughes Incorporated 2002 Employee Long-Term Incentive Plan (the ""), provides for cash awards for participants if performance goals are met during the term of the PUP. The performance goals are related to the Company's achievement as compared to a peer group of companies. Achievement is measured over multiple performance periods from the beginning of 2009 to the end of 2011. Twenty-five percent of the Total Unit Value is determined based upon one-year performance relative to certain specified performance criteria during each of 2009, 2010, and 2011. The final 25 percent of the Total Unit Value is calculated at the end of 2011 based upon the cumulative performance of the Company over the three-year performance period 2009 through 2011.
