Exhibit 99.1
Baker Hughes Announces Third Quarter Results
HOUSTON, Texas  November 1, 2011. Baker Hughes Incorporated (NYSE: BHI) today announced adjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure) for the third quarter 2011 of $518 million, or $1.18 per diluted share. This excludes a $214 million tax benefit associated with the reorganization of certain foreign subsidiaries and a $26 million after-tax loss related to the early extinguishment of debt. This compares to $255 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, for the third quarter 2010, and adjusted net income of $408 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, for the second quarter 2011.
Net income attributable to Baker Hughes, a GAAP measure, for the third quarter 2011 was $706 million or $1.61 per diluted share, compared to $255 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, for the third quarter 2010, and $338 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, for the second quarter 2011. Please see Table 1 for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Financial Measures.
Revenue for the third quarter 2011 was $5.18 billion, up 27% compared to $4.08 billion for the third quarter 2010 and up 9% compared to $4.74 billion for the second quarter 2011.
Chad C. Deaton, Baker Hughes Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "The third quarter was a record revenue quarter for Baker Hughes.
"In Canada, the rig count grew substantially throughout the quarter and our operational results reflected this growth. Strong growth continues across U.S. Land, and capacity across most of the market remains tight. The Gulf of Mexico improved marginally during the quarter as the pace of permitting modestly improved. We continue to position our organization to respond to gradual growth in the Gulf of Mexico over the medium term.
"Internationally, we delivered strong revenue growth, but margins declined approximately 125 basis points primarily as a result of a change in geographic and product mix. The strategy we set in place last year to enhance our international operating margins has delivered approximately 700 basis points year-on-year improvement. We expect to deliver 15% international margins in the fourth quarter.
"The commodity, capital, and foreign exchange markets have experienced tremendous volatility throughout the third quarter; however, we have seen no material change in customer behavior. A substantial majority of our customers' projects are justified at prices far lower than the current commodity price levels and sufficient liquidity appears to be available to continue to develop these projects. We are very encouraged by the long-term prospects for the North American and

International markets. Oil demand is at record levels and growth for hydrocarbons will remain strong in the years to come, supported by the continued industrialization of developing economies. Production from declining conventional resources will be replaced by increases in production from the service-intensive unconventional hydrocarbon resources in the U.S. and over time, internationally. We continue to position Baker Hughes to take advantage of long-term opportunities while maintaining the flexibility to address short-term changes to our business," Deaton said.
Debt increased by $292 million to $3.90 billion compared to the second quarter 2011, reflecting the issuance of $750 million 3.2% 10-year notes and the redemption of $500 million 6.5% notes. Cash and short-term investments decreased by $134 million to $803 million compared to the second quarter 2011. Capital expenditures were $628 million, depreciation and amortization expense was $332 million, and dividend payments were $65 million in the third quarter 2011.
Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter 2011 was $1.15 billion, up $131 million sequentially. A reconciliation of net income attributable to Baker Hughes to Adjusted EBITDA is provided in Table 2. Supplemental financial information for revenue and adjusted operating profit before tax (a non-GAAP measure) is provided in Table 4.

Operational Highlights
North America
We completed a 49-stage annular fracture treatment in the Barnett Shale using our next-generation OptiPort coiled-tubing frac sleeve technology with our SureSet bottomhole assembly to isolate each stage during each interval. The entire treatment was completed in 10 days, about one-third of the time normally required. This was the first run for OptiPort in US Land, and marks an important milestone in our hydraulic fracturing program as it significantly reduced operational time, hydraulic horsepower and the personnel required on location.
We continue deployment of the InTallic disintegrating Frac Balls and AutoTrak Curve system, with encouraging customer acceptance of the technologies.
TM
In the Gulf of Mexico, the Baker Hughes Blue Tarpon deep water stimulation vessel completed its first fracturing job for a major integrated oil company with favorable results.
Latin America
In the quarter, we won a drilling optimization project in Brazil for four wells in a pre-salt field, further establishing our leadership position in the Brazil deep water market.
Also in Brazil, we opened our tenth major research and technology center, located in Rio de Janeiro, to commercialize technologies and solutions that will unlock the full potential of deep water and pre-salt reservoirs. The center represents the next phase in the expansion of our global technology network and will enable a new level of collaboration with our customers and Latin America universities.
In Mexico, we see positive activity with the award of a two-year offshore directional drilling and drill-bit services contract in the Veracruz district; and a three-and-a-half year offshore directional drilling and drill-bit services contract in the Southwestern Marine region.
Middle East/Asia Pacific
In the Middle East, we secured a three-year contract with Al Khafji Joint Operations for a substantial portion of the drilling and workover services. Bundled and third-party services will include: directional and horizontal drilling; wireline logging and perforating; surface logging and

coring; mud engineering and chemicals supply; and cementing, simulation and coiled tubing services.
In Iraq, we won an integrated drilling and completions package from Lukoil covering 23 wells in the West Qurna phase two field. We will provide engineering and project management for the turnkey drilling and completions scope of the project. Furthermore, we will supply drilling services, formation evaluation, casing and tubing running services, completion tools and services, wellbore intervention services, and wireline logging as well as perforation operations. Baker Hughes also will contract all third-party services, equipment, personnel, tools and materials required for the project, including the provision of up to five drilling rigs and three workover rigs. Work will commence in the first quarter of 2012.
In Asia Pacific, we completed the first commercial installation of GeoFORM, our next-generation conformable sand management system, with a "Select-a-Flow" screen. Traditional gravel packing is challenging in the region because it is so remote. GeoFORM provided an effective solution to the customer and future installations are planned.
In Malaysia, we secured a major HPHT drilling fluids and fluids environmental services project that will run for four years, commencing in the fourth quarter of 2011. These wells pose considerable technical challenges with bottom hole static temperature in excess of 400 F (204 C) and pressures above 10,000 psi (689 bar).

In India, we secured a sizable award to provide a full ESP solution to design, supply, install, commission and monitor performance for five years in 81 wells, which we believe is one of the largest offshore ESP contracts in India.
Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian
In the Netherlands, we drilled a multi-lateral well for a National Oil Company, utilizing drilling services, drill bits, sand control screens and intelligent production systems, resulting in a high-quality wellbore which has been proposed to showcase in a joint technical paper with the customer.
In Africa, we were awarded a three-year directional drilling contract in Algeria, to provide services on more than 70 wells. Operations will commence on two rigs, with the potential to add a third rig mid-2012.
