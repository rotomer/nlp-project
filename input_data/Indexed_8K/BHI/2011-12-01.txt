Item 8.01. Other Events.
In November 2011 Baker Hughes Incorporated (the "Company" or "Baker Hughes") increased its commercial paper program from $1.0 billion to $2.5 billion. The maximum maturity for short-term commercial paper issued under the program is 270 days. The amount Baker Hughes may issue under the commercial paper program now equals the amount of its five-year committed $2.5 billion revolving credit facility that expires in September 2016 (the "Credit Facility"). To the extent the Company has amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility, its aggregate ability to issue commercial paper is reduced. At December 1, 2011, Baker Hughes had no outstanding commercial paper and no amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
