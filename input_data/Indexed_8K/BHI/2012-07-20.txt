Exhibit 99.1
Baker Hughes Announces Second Quarter Results
HOUSTON, July 20, 2012  Baker Hughes Incorporated (NYSE: BHI) announced today net income of
$439 million
for the second quarter of 2012. Diluted earnings per share was
$1.00
, which compares to
$0.77
for the
second quarter of 2011
and
$0.86
for the
first quarter of 2012
.
Revenue for the
second quarter of 2012
was
$5.33 billion
,
up
12%
compared to
$4.74 billion
for the
second quarter of 2011
and
down
0.5%
compared to
$5.36 billion
for the
first quarter of 2012
.
Baker Hughes delivered improved results in the second quarter, said Martin Craighead, Baker Hughes President and Chief Executive Officer. We achieved 2 percent sequential growth in operating income despite challenging market conditions in North America. The impact on margins from the seasonal slowdown in Canada was mostly offset by improved results in onshore U.S. The initiatives to improve our Pressure Pumping business helped stabilize its results this quarter by offsetting the higher costs for certain raw materials and the weaker market conditions for Pressure Pumping. Our International business delivered improved revenue and operating profit, driven primarily by outstanding performance in Europe and the Middle East.
We are cautiously optimistic about the market outlook for the remainder of the year. If commodity prices remain at current levels, we believe activity in onshore U.S. should remain stable. In the Gulf of Mexico and International, we expect continuing improvement as these markets expand, Craighead added.
Debt
increased
by
$514 million
to
$5.03 billion
compared to the
first quarter of 2012
. Cash
increased
by
$12 million
to
$792 million
compared to the
first quarter of 2012
.
The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2012 was favorably impacted by the settlement of certain tax audits and other matters. The Company continues to expect the full year 2012 effective tax rate to be between 33% and 34%.
Capital expenditures were
$771 million
, depreciation and amortization expense was
$380 million
, and dividend payments were
$66 million
in the
second quarter of 2012
.
EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) in the second quarter 2012 was $1.02 billion, up $29 million sequentially. A reconciliation of net income attributable to Baker Hughes to EBITDA is provided in Table 2.

Baker Hughes Operational Highlights
North America
Since being introduced a year ago, Baker Hughes AutoTrak Curve has drilled over one million feet in the United States. By comparison, the previous generation AutoTrak system took three years to achieve the one million foot milestone globally.
Upstream Chemicals recently won a five-year contract as sole provider of process, de-oiling, and water treatment specialty chemicals and associated technical support services for a major steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) operator in Canada's oil sands.
Latin America
Baker Hughes recently set a record in Mexico by drilling faster and farther with the first run of a Kymera hybrid drill bit powered by an X-treme LS motor. This performance, 74 percent better than the longest offset run in this geologic interval, cut almost two days of drilling time.
Baker Hughes recently received two significant contracts for Completions Systems in offshore Mexico. Baker Hughes will provide liner hanger equipment for new and workover wells, in addition to EZ-CASE drill shoe and EZ-REAM shoe drilling accessories.
Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian
Upstream Chemicals opened a new chemical supply base in Aberdeen to service production enhancement and flow assurance in the North Sea.  Baker Hughes delivered three separate, successful trials with green chemistry demulsifiers at three separate offshore customer facilities.
Baker Hughes Drilling Services drilled the two longest, extended-reach wells on the Russian mainland. Both wells were in the remote Yamal Peninsula above the Arctic Circle extending below the Kara Sea. The well construction enabled production without the costly construction of building an island or moving in an offshore rig.
Middle East/Asia Pacific
Baker Hughes was awarded a long-term Engineering, Project Management and Integrated Operations drilling contract by Saudi Aramco for turn-key delivery of over 75 wells in the Shaybah field. The scope of work awarded to Baker Hughes comprises project management, provision of three drilling rigs and well engineering and all associated services, including Drill Bits, Drilling and Completion Fluids, Directional Drilling and Logging While Drilling services, Wireline, Cementing and Pressure Pumping, gyro surveys and slickline services, as well as completion equipment and services.
Baker Hughes Integrated Operations achieved an accelerated startup in Iraq and is currently operating six rigs. The first well has been delivered, and two more wells are on schedule to be delivered before the end of July. A chemicals blend plant is now operational in country.
