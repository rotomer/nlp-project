Below is a revised Summary Compensation Table for inclusion in the Company's Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the Commission on April 8, 2003. The revised Summary Compensation Table corrects two inadvertent errors relating to Messrs. Naylor and Waite's 2002 Salary. Specifically, Mr. Naylor's 2002 Salary should have been stated as $408,077 rather than $390,731. Similarly, Mr. Waite's 2002 Salary should have been stated as $372,115 rather than $356,250. The corrections have been made on the Table below.
The following Summary Compensation Table sets forth the individual compensation paid to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and each of the four other most highly compensated executive officers for services in all capacities to the Company for fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
