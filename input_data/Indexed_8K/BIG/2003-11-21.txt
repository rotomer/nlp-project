ITEM: Financial statements and exhibits
 
 
On November 19, 2003, Big Lots, Inc. ("Company") issued a press release and conducted a conference call setting forth the Company's results of operations for the year-to-date and quarter ended November 1, 2003.
The press release and conference call included the following non-GAAP financial measures (as defined by Regulation G): (i) non-GAAP adjusted net income (loss) and (ii) non-GAAP adjusted net income (loss) per share. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude from the directly comparable GAAP measures a one-time after-tax charge recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 related to the settlement of a national class action lawsuit concerning certain advertising practices of KB Toys, and a one-time after-tax charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 related to the settlement of class action lawsuits concerning the calculation of earned overtime wages for certain of the Company's former and current store managers and assistant managers in California. As required by Regulation G, the press release contains a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The Company's management believes that the disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors because the non-GAAP financial measures present an alternative method for measuring the Company's operating performance excluding non-recurring items that would normally be included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and because management believes that the one-time after-tax charges are not indicative of the Company's core operating results and the financial condition of the Company's business. The Company has not incurred similar settlement costs of this magnitude in the past and does not anticipate being required to again in the future.
The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures along with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in evaluating the Company's operating performance and as a measure of performance for incentive compensation purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as reported by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled items reported by other companies.
 
A copy of the Company's press release is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1, and a copy of the transcript of the conference call is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.2. The information in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 is being furnished, not filed, under Item 12 of this Current Report on Form 8-K. By filing this Current Report on Form 8-K and furnishing this information, the Company is making no admission as to the materiality of any information in this Current Report, including the Exhibits.
      Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
Columbus, Ohio  November 19, 2003  Big Lots, Inc. (NYSE: BLI) today reported a third quarter fiscal 2003 net loss from continuing operations of $5.1 million, or $0.04 per share, which is flat to fiscal 2002 results. Including an after-tax charge to discontinued operations of $1.3 million related to the settlement of a class action lawsuit, the Company's third quarter net loss was $6.4 million, or $0.05 per share.
Year to date, the Company's net loss was $4.2 million, or $0.04 per share, and includes the impact of one-time after-tax charges taken to settle class action lawsuits, which are discussed in more detail later in this release. Excluding these charges, year to date net income was $3.5 million, or $0.03 per share, compared to net income of $10.3 million, or $0.09 per share, during the same thirty-nine week period of fiscal 2002.
For the thirteen-week quarter ended November 1, 2003, the Company reported net sales of $948.1 million, a 9.2% increase compared to net sales of $868.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2002. Comparable store sales for stores open two years at the beginning of the fiscal year were up 4.3% for the quarter behind a 2.3% increase in customer transactions and a 2.0% increase in the value of the average basket. On a year to date basis, net sales increased 7.3% to $2,845.8 million compared to net sales of $2,651.6 million in fiscal 2002. Comparable store sales increased 2.8% for the year to date period with customer transactions increasing 1.5% and the value of the average basket increasing 1.3%.
Commenting on the results, Michael J. Potter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We were pleased with the August and September sales performance, with comps on plan and increasing 5% through the first ten weeks of the quarter behind strong customer count increases. However, sales slowed during October leading to a slight miss to plan for the quarter. The late October slowdown appears to have been isolated as sales and customer trends have improved in November. Through the first two weeks of this month, sales are meeting our plan which calls for a comp sales increase in the mid-single digit range with the majority of the increase coming from customer transactions. While the most important shopping days are still ahead, we are encouraged that November's rebound includes an acceleration in the sales trend of our holiday decorative merchandise."
Mr. Potter continued, "Consumables, hardlines, and furniture continued to drive sales growth during the third quarter. In our September sales release, we indicated the strength in our lower margin need-based consumables category combined with softness in our higher margin seasonal decorative merchandise would pressure gross margin for the quarter. The third quarter's 80 basis point gross margin rate decline compared to last year was primarily attributable to this shift in merchandise mix. Disciplined operational management and controlled growth of expenses drove 60 basis points of expense leverage for the quarter. We believe this level of leverage at a 4% sales comp is important and further demonstrates the potential of our financial model."
 
Commenting on the strength of the balance sheet, Mr. Potter added, "We continue to focus on working capital management. At the end of the quarter, net debt was down to last year by $13 million despite a year-to-date increase in capital expenditures of $57 million, primarily related to the construction of our fifth distribution center. Inventories of $987 million as of the end of the quarter were up less than 1% on a per store basis compared to last year. Our inventory levels are mixed appropriately as we have continued to fund categories with strong sales trends such as consumables and furniture. In contrast, we have conservatively managed the inventory levels in seasonal categories and focused the assortment towards more basic items and less decorative merchandise. Throughout this year, our merchant team has done a terrific job of aggressively managing inventory levels, driving improved inventory turns, and maintaining flexibility with available open-to-buy dollars to take advantage of great closeout opportunities."
Mr. Potter continued, "As we begin the all-important fourth quarter, we are encouraged by the underlying trends of our business. Improving customer traffic trends in early November and the compounding positive impact of our key business initiatives leave us well positioned to capitalize on the holiday traffic over the next five weeks. Our national advertising program continues to drive increased customer transactions as over 550 stores are currently benefiting from television exposure for the first time. Accelerating the expansion of our furniture business has helped increase sales productivity and, consistent with plan, we will have a furniture department in over 60% of our closeout stores by the end of this year. Finally, our store remodel efforts have upgraded the physical appearance of approximately 650 stores over the past two and a half years. With the year drawing to a close, performance to date across these key initiatives is, in the aggregate, in line with our expectations."
Mr. Potter concluded, "Looking ahead to next year, 2004 should be a year in which we leverage the investments we have made over the last three years. Controlled expense growth, including prioritized and reduced initiative spending, should enable us to leverage expenses at a lower comp, which will be key to expanding our operating margin. More detail around our comp, gross margin, expense and capital spending assumptions will be in our fourth quarter earnings release; however, at this point we feel comfortable with Thomson Financial/First Call's fiscal 2004 EPS consensus forecast of $0.85."
The Company's fourth quarter earnings guidance calls for earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.64 to $0.69, a 12% to 21% increase over the prior year. This guidance is based on a fourth quarter comparable store sales increase in the mid-single digit range, with increases expected in the mid-single digit range in November, December, and January.
The Company announced August 20, 2003 that it had reached a preliminary agreement to settle a national class action lawsuit relating to certain advertising practices of KB Toys. The Court has now issued a final order approving the agreement. The Company recently contributed $2.1 million towards the $4.0 million settlement amount, which amounts to 53% of the total. Accordingly, a one-time after-tax charge of $1.3 million was recorded to discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
As a reminder, the Company also announced August 20, 2003 that it reached a preliminary agreement to settle two California class action lawsuits relating to the calculation of earned overtime wages for certain of the Company's former and current store managers and assistant store managers in that state. While the matter is still subject to final court approval, the Company believes the liability is both probable and can be reasonably estimated. Accordingly, a one-time after-tax charge of $6.4 million was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2003, reducing second quarter earnings per share by $0.06. The Company does not expect the settlement to have a material impact on its cost structure going forward.

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Big Lots third quarter 2003 earnings conference call. During this session all lines will be muted until the question and answer portion of the call. If you need any assistance, please press star zero and an operator will assist you. At this time I would like to introduce today's first speaker, Mike Potter. Mike?
Michael Potter
- Big Lots, Inc.  Chairman, President, CEO
Thanks, John and thank you everyone for joining us for our third quarter conference call.
With me today are Al Bell, our Vice Chairman and Chief Administrative Officer and Jeff Naylor, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Also with me are Joe Cooper, Vice President, Treasurer and head of Investor Relations, as well as Chuck Haubiel, Vice President and General Counsel.
I'd like to remind you that any forward-looking statements we make on today's call involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to our Safe Harbor provisions as stated in our press release and our SEC filings and that actual results can differ materially from those described in our forward-looking statements.
We want to accomplish several things today. After some opening remarks, Jeff will cover the third quarter financial results then Al will update you on the progress we've made on our key initiatives. After some closing comments we'll be glad to answer your questions.
First let me cover a few highlights for the quarter. This morning we reported a loss per share from continuing operations of 4 cents which was flat to last year and consistent with the revised guidance included in our October sales release. The midpoint of our original guidance was a loss per share of 1 cent. As we discussed in our sales releases, 2 cents of this 3 cent variance related to the shift in our sales mix, and the remaining penny related to October sales coming in below our plan.
Looking at our sales trend, comparable store sales for the quarter up 4.3% behind a 2.3% increase in customer transactions and a 2% increase in the value of the average basket. We were pleased with August and September sales performance with comps of 4.8% and 5.2% where sales were consistently on plan through the first 10 weeks of the quarter.
However sales slowed at the end of October leading to a slight miss for the quarter. This softening of October sales has been a trend for the last few years as customers shop later and later for
 
their holiday decorations and gifts. Frankly that period of time is a challenge for us as we go into next year and plan for that type of an event.
Looking forward to the next five weeks, the brief comp deceleration in October does not discourage us as we believe we will continue to deliver great value to our customers during this critical time of the year through a broad selection of toys, gifts and holiday decorative merchandise.
From a merchandising perspective, consumables, hard lines and furniture continue to drive sales growth. These key categories have been strong all year and are expected to continue to grow meaningfully in the fourth quarter.
As we noted in our September sales release, the strength in our lower margin need-based consumables category combined with softness in our higher margin home decor and seasonal decorative merchandise negatively impacted our gross margin rate in the third quarter. We believe the weakness in our seasonal decorative category is related in part to the customer trend to shop closer and closer to each holiday.
We were encouraged that although sales of our Halloween and harvest seasonal merchandise started slowly in September, the trend accelerated in October as the respective seasons approached and sales were on plan by the end of October. Consistent with trends in those two categories, we're encouraged with the first two and a half weeks of November, as sales of our holiday trim a tree seasonal merchandise have also accelerated and appear to be getting back on track.
As you know, the growth of our operating income rate is dependent on controlling expense growth, lowering the leverage point, and growing the top line. We're pleased that during the third quarter, we were able to leverage expenses 60 basis points despite having a top line that landed slightly below our plan at a 4.3% comp.
Now, let me turn it over to Jeff who will cover the financial results.
Jeffrey Naylor
- Big Lots, Inc.  Sr. Vice President, CFO
Thanks, Mike. Good morning everyone.
What I'd like to do today consistent with what we've done in prior calls is just briefly recap the third quarter results. I'll provide some commentary on the P&L and then I'll speak to the balance sheet and cash flow.
Really first let me address the legal settlement that we announced in this morning's press release. What we announced was that the court has issued a final order approving the agreement to settle the national class action lawsuit that related to certain advertising practices of KB Toys which as most of you know, KB was previously owned by Big Lots.
As you may recall, we announced in our second quarter earnings release back in August that we had reached a preliminary agreement to settle this case. The update here is that the court has now issue a final order approving the agreement and the company has contributed $2.1 million towards the total $4 million settlement amount. That amounts to about 53% of the total that the company has contributed.
Accordingly we've taken a one time after tax charge of $1.3 million and that was recorded to discontinued operations and we booked that in the third quarter.
On the call this morning I'm going to speak to results from continuing operations as the penny discontinued operations charge is reported separately in our P&L. So all the remarks I make today will address results from continuing operations.
Sales for the third quarter of 2003 were slightly below plan at $948 million and that represents an increase of 9.2% over the prior year. The sales growth was driven by a 4.3% comp store sales increase, and the net addition year-over-year of 53 stores.
As Mike noted, the comps sales growth was made up of a 2.3% increase in customer transactions and a 2.0% increase in the value of the average basket. With third quarter behind us now we've now grown customer transactions year-over-year in seven of the last eight quarters, and in fact the only quarter where we haven't had positive customer count growth was the fourth quarter of last year, which I think as everyone knows was negatively impacted by the retail calendar shift with six fewer shopping days falling between Thanksgiving and Christmas.
Let me now turn to gross margin. Our gross margin rate for the quarter was 41.4%. That was down 80 basis points compared to last year and it was 60 basis points below the midpoint of our original guidance.
As we communicated in the September sales release, the acceleration in the consumables business combined with softness in some of the higher margin discretionary categories, particularly the slower than planned start to the seasonal business adversely impacted the third quarter gross margin rate.
Mike touched on this briefly, expenses were well-managed this quarter, and we were able to flex expenses with the slight shortfall in sales and came in favorable to our plan and at the midpoint of guidance. With our third quarter SG&A rate which was 41.9%, we were able to leverage expenses 60 basis points on a 4.3% comp.
So, you know, looking at that, we had some expense leverage from occupancy and other primarily fixed costs that was partially offset by the deleveraging impact from distribution and transportation
 
costs. Overall that's, as you peel back the onion that was the performance of expenses.
And I could point out that our expense structure would have enabled us to leverage it slightly below a 3% comp this quarter and we think that's encouraging as we strive to expand our operating margin through expense leverage.
Interest expense was $3.8 million for the quarter. That's slightly below plan and it's down to last year due to the capitalization of interest related to the construction of our Durant, Oklahoma distribution center, consistent with accounting rules we are capitalizing the interest during the construction period.
The income tax rate for the quarter was 39.5% and that is also unchanged, or that is unchanged from prior year.
And as Mike mentioned, just summing it all up, we reported a third quarter net loss from continuing operations of $5.1 million or 4 cents a share and that's flat to fiscal 2002 results. So that's the P&L.
In terms of the balance sheet we continue to focus on aggressive balance sheet management. Cash flow for the quarter was decreased by $51 million, that was in line with expectations and was due to net operating loss, the investment we make at this time of year to build seasonal inventories and the higher level of capital spending.
Capex was $37 million for the quarter, that's up $17 million over the third quarter of last year. Capex year-to-date is $125 million, and that's up $57 million to last year. And the increased level of capital spending both year-to-date and in the third quarter was principally due to the construction of the Durant DC, and again was in line with our plan.
Despite the increased capex, long-term debt was down $13 million compared to last year ending the quarter at $281 million. We remain comfortable with our full-year estimate of $20 to $40 million of positive cash flow for the year, and that's coming despite a capex plan that's $60 million greater than last year. So, $20 to $40 million of cash flow for the year we remain comfortable with that estimate and this cash flow estimate implies a year-end invested cash balance of $165 to $185 million.
Depreciation expense was $22 million for the quarter and it's $65 million for the year-to-date period.
I think as most of you know, inventory and supply chain management is critical as we work to maintain the appropriate inventory levels while driving higher levels of sales and inventory turns.
We ended the third quarter with total inventory of $987 million, and that's up less than 1% on an average store basis. As we enter the fourth quarter we believe that our inventories are very well positioned and well positioned by category.
I'll now turn it over to Al who will update you on our 2003 strategic initiatives.
Albert Bell
- Big Lots, Inc.  Vice Chairman, CAO
Thanks, Jeff.
As we mentioned in our earnings release today, we continue to be pleased with the progress of our key business initiatives and their impact on sales and customer counts. What I would like to do is provide some additional detail behind each of these initiatives.
Through our national television advertising campaign we continue to drive incremental customer traffic. With discount shopping becoming more widespread there is a tremendous opportunity to communicate the closeout shopping experience and to build the Big Lots brand.
This year, over 550 stores are benefitting from television for the first time as all 1,424 of our stores now have TV advertising. Through the third quarter, results are slightly ahead of our plan which called for the program to be accretive to EPS this year with an incremental impact on full-year comps of 1.5%.
Beginning earlier this month we began running three new holiday TV commercials featuring our great selection of toys and holiday decorations.
Now, let me turn to our ongoing store cleanup and remodel program.
In August, we finished this year's program as we remodeled 211 stores in 2003. While the sales impact in these stores has missed our expectations, customer response to the remodeled stores has been positive and we feel good about how the stores look as we move into the holiday shopping season.
And now with 2003's remodel program behind us, approximately 70% of our chain has either been touched since we began this initiative, just two and a half years ago, or is a new store opened in the past five years, which have been consistent with our upgraded store standards.
For the third quarter, we opened 29 new stores and closed nine stores. Year-to-date we have opened 67 stores and closed 23, for a net increase of 44 stores. For the full year, we expect to open 86 new stores and close 37.
Our new stores continue to outperform expectations with approximately 90% of our new stores opening with a furniture department. The majority of our store closings this year will be
 
relocations to new, more desirable locations and another five to 10 are situations where we were unable to negotiate an extension or relocate within the same trade area.
We closed very few stores, maybe five stores a year due to financial performance which highlights the strength of the individual store economic model. At the end of the third quarter, we were operating 1,424 stores, including 45 freestanding furniture stores.
Next I want to briefly update you on the progress of our furniture business.
The continued success of this program led to an aggressive furniture strategy in 2003, where we estimate this year's growth will have an incremental impact on full-year comps of just less than 1%. Year-to-date, we have added a net of 133 new furniture departments, 60 of which are in new stores, and 73 were added to existing stores by expanding the store or eliminating hanging apparel.
At the end of the third quarter, we were operating 820 furniture departments, up 164, or 25% compared to last year. In fact, we will have a furniture department in over 60% of our closeout stores by the end of the year.
Furthermore, year-to-date, we have expanded the square footage allocated to furniture departments in approximately 240 existing stores by eliminating hanging apparel in those stores. We are pleased with the sales productivity gains resulting from our decision to replace apparel with furniture.
Finally, construction of our fifth distribution center in Durant, Oklahoma, is complete as we now focus on installing the interior racking and conveyor system. Costing about $70 million, the facility is being funded out of cash flow from operations.
The distribution center is scheduled to begin shipping in the first quarter of 2004. With the addition of this facility, we estimate our DC infrastructure can support about 1750 stores.
With the year drawing to a close, performance to date across these key initiatives is in the aggregate in line with our expectations. From an investment standpoint, we are right on budget. And most importantly, we can measure and see the impact of these programs reflected in our sales results.
I'll now turn it back over to Mike for some closing comments.
Michael Potter
- Big Lots, Inc.  Chairman, President, CEO
Thanks, Al. Before we take your questions I'd like to make a few comments about fourth quarter, specifically the next five weeks.
As we look forward, there are many parts of our business that we feel very good about. Our consumables business driven by great closeout deals and our Never Out program continues to bring new customers to our stores and existing customers in for an extra visit.
Our merchant team in the hard lines areas has done a wonderful job this year growing that business and delivering great electronics, tools and other closeout merchandise to our customers. And as Al mentioned our furniture category continues to grow as our team expands this business across the country.
However, while these categories are very important, a critical driver of our success over the next five weeks will be toys and seasonal. These two categories will account for approximately 30% of our sales in the November and December timeframe. And as Al mentioned this year for first time we have three television commercials produced for the holiday season featuring these two merchandise categories.
Let me give you some perspective on how we see these categories shaping up.
First the toy business accelerated nicely in October and is right on track to deliver a great holiday season. One of the advantages to toys is that we sell them year round, which minimizes our markdown exposure in this category. Having said that, toy sales during the first two weeks of November are on our plan and the inventory levels look great.
Regarding our holiday trim a tree merchandise we bought this category more conservatively this year and pushed back its arrival into stores to be more constant with the later customer demand. The assortment is weighted more heavily towards basic merchandise and less on a decorative component that carries with it a higher potential markdown liability. And we planned sales at a comp that was lower than the company average.
Based on sales trends month to date, combined with the current inventory levels of decorative seasonal merchandise and the forecasted markdowns included in our guidance, we feel comfortable with our fourth quarter earnings guidance of 64 to 69 cents per share, given a mid single-digit comp performance for the company in total for the quarter.
And looking ahead to next year, 2004 should be a year where we leverage the investments we've made over the last three years. Just to take you back, in 2002, our leverage point on SG&A was about a 6% comp. This year, it will be about a 4% comp and next year with controlled expense growth including prioritized and reduced initiative spending, we should leverage expenses at a lower comp which will be key to expanding our operating margin.
As we've done in the past three years, we'll lay out specific fiscal 2004 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings release and conference call, including quarterly comp, gross margin expense
 
and Cap Ex, as well as initiative spending and payback assumptions.
I just feel at this point it's important for you to know that earnings and operating margin growth are going to be very important for us next year and we don't intend to make dramatic changes to our strategy that would jeopardize that growth. So although the most important month of fiscal 2003 is still ahead of us, at this point we do feel comfortable with Thompson First Call fiscal 2004 EPS consensus forecast of 85 cents. I'd like to now open it up for your questions. John, if you could open the line.
QUESTION AND ANSWER
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to ask a question, simply press the one key on your telephone. Please be aware that by pressing the one key a second time your question will be withdrawn. In the interest of time we do ask that you limit your questions to two questions per person. Our first question comes from Eric Beder of Northeast Securities. Eric, please go ahead.
Eric Beder
- Northeast Securities
Good morning. On the furniture business, what is the incremental gains which you shift it over from the hangers in terms of top line and profitability?
Michael Potter
- Big Lots, Inc.  Chairman, President, CEO
Well, I think to the extent that we've communicated the furniture impact  first of all, that's a fairly complicated question because there's a variety of ways in which we have introduced furniture into stores. Primarily in size of departments, some stores removing hanging apparel, some stores not removing hanging apparel, the extent of what we've communicated that impact to be, I think Al mentioned that for this year in total, the sum of that initiative we think is slightly less than 1% comp incremental to the business.
Jeffrey Naylor
- Big Lots, Inc.  Sr. Vice President, CFO
In terms of, if I could jump in, in terms of the profitability, we've mentioned before that furniture is, in terms of the margin, is slightly above company average. Actually very comparable to the apparel gross margins.
Eric Beder
- Northeast Securities
And what is in the long run where does the apparel go [inaudible]? Do you, are [inaudible] pretty much eliminating everything but the basics in the apparel business?
Michael Potter

We have not outlined the strategy for next year but in the last couple of years we've indicated that we are continuing to move out of the hanging apparel business. We will stay in lingerie, the basics business, that type of thing which does very well for us but hanging apparel over time is not a business we plan to be in. We plan to be in the deals business, surrounding that, the occasional leather jackets or nurse's uniforms or things like that that we find
 
opportunities on a closeout basis but we don't feel the category in total is a point of differentiation for us. So we are moving away from that.

Our next question comes from Jeff Stein, CFA of McDonald Investments. Jeff, please go ahead.
Jeff Stein

Good morning, guys. A couple of questions. First of all, big article this morning on Wal-Mart and the fact that they are significantly discounting toys and even selling them below cost. I'm kind of curious if you indicated that you're on plan for toys, but do you believe that Wal-Mart might be hurting you at all? And then I do have one follow-up question.
Michael Potter
- Big Lots, Inc.  Chairman, President, CEO
Well, you know, I read that article, too, and I first of all I think Wal-Mart hurts everybody to some degree, but we are off to a great start in toys. We're off to a better start than last year and toys behaved a lot like Christmas trim for us, in that every year when we look at our comps we find that the biggest comps come toward the end of the season and that reflects who our customer is and more of a need-based shopping.
We're doing real well right now in toys and certainly off to a better pace than last year. So outside of learning about that event, the same way all of you did, we would not have noticed anything like that.
And I think what I would say initially is that most of what is happening is happening on the new released toys. And we're really not a new-release toy business, we're a closeout toy business. Our price points are materially different than the discount retailers, and the values there are pretty extreme but we're not in the hit toy business. So I think that's a battle that's being fought more by the regular retailers and not a battle that's being fought by Big Lots.
Jeff Stein

Okay. A follow-up question, Mike, and this regards your leverage point because it seems pretty clear that really is the focus of the company next year and that's what's going to get you to a higher operating margin. Number one, do you still believe an 8% operating margin target is realistic for the company? And do you still believe you can get there the same way that you thought you would a couple years ago? In other words, can you get there by driving productivity or do you think you might need to accelerate your store expansion at some point?
Michael Potter
- Big Lots, Inc.  Chairman, President, CEO
I don't think our thinking on that has changed at all. We definitely believe over the long course that we should be a business that should deliver that kind of operating margin.
What we haven't laid out is how fast we think we can get there but what we have said for three years and will continue to say going forward is that past this initial investment phase of which not only were we refining the approach of the business, but also catching up for a lot of investment that hadn't been made in the prior 10 years for this business, that our goal as we get through that is to continue to lower the leverage point for the business.
Ideally what we'd like to do is be able to achieve that leverage at the lowest comp that we can manage to but obviously still work very hard to deliver strong sales per square foot performance and strong comp performance and strong customer count performance. And there we fall back on the analysis of how we believe that we are underperforming where we should be in terms of productivity per square foot, and that will continue to be an objective.
But what I like about the approach of our model is to keep lowering that break point for SG&A, so you have this safety in terms of earnings growth but you don't have to achieve an extraordinary comp in order to grow that operating profit. But if you are able to generate strong comps, you get good strong flow through on the sales which is obviously what we've seen in the past few years in terms of the way our model performs.

Our next question comes from Mark Mandel of Blaylock and Partners. Mark, please go ahead.
Mark Mandel

Thanks, good morning, everyone. I was wondering if you could just comment on your plans for advertising spending next year both in terms of the overall level of spending, the media that you might focus on, and where the spending might rest as a percent of sales?
Michael Potter
- Big Lots, Inc.  Chairman, President, CEO
I think that's a great question and I can only partially answer it because we are really starting our full budgeting process for next year. We have started it in the last month, we'll go through the fourth quarter and do all of our work on that, and we obviously want to make sure we get our full board signoff in February before we communicate the details.
 
But we have certainly gone through it initially and what I would tell you is that while we still have some varying TV tests that have been in place this year for us to test different levels of TV investment, generally our thinking is that we think we've found a pretty good spot in terms of the number of circulars that we're running, we believe that we've found a pretty good level of investment in terms of TV that provides the payback that we're looking for, and as we communicated last year when we started this national TV investment program, was we anticipated that the second year of that program would be a year in which we would leverage the advertising spend. And I would still tell you that's our expectation today. But I can't tell you to the degree or what the details of that are.
Mark Mandel
- Blaylock & Partners
Fair enough. Second question, can you discuss any areas in terms of initiatives that you might focus on next year? Obviously a lot of these initiatives are starting to wind down or will complete their rollout. Can you discuss with us or share with us any insights as to what you might focus on in the years, next year and the years to follow?
Michael Potter
- Big Lots, Inc.  Chairman, President, CEO
Well, I think in general, none of those initiatives really wind down. I guess some of them evolve from one stage to another stage, but in terms of the initiatives of building the brand, customer-driven merchandising, customer-driven stores, supply chain management, building our team, all those things continue on, they continue on in varying forms.
In terms of our name changes are complete, our evolution into national TV is complete but we'll continue to evolve each of those strategies, we'll still make a decision next year as to whether we're doing continuing remodels, to what extent we do continuing remodels, we will definitely continue what we think is a lot of opportunity in front of us in terms of supply chain management. Obviously, we spend a great deal of time in terms of merchandising initiatives that is the key to driving greater productivity in the box.
So all of those things, I think we're going to have varying forms of those initiatives continuing into the coming years, but in general, most of the large investment periods are behind us. And our ability to just maintain or build momentum on those is what we'll be focusing on going forward.

Ladies and gentlemen, just a reminder before we take our next question, if you'd like to ask a question, simply press the one key on your touch-tone phone. Our next question comes from Mike Napolitana from JMP Securities. Mike, please go ahead.
Mike Napolitana
- JMP Securities
Good morning. I was wondering if you could shed some light on your SG&A expense assumptions in the fourth quarter, maybe talk about the mix between just leveraging occupancy costs, the lack or incremental advertising spend. That's a pretty big jump you're expecting to make in the fourth quarter, I just want to make sure I understand the drivers. Thanks.
Jeffrey Naylor
- Big Lots, Inc.  Sr. Vice President, CFO
Yeah, this is Jeff. We expect in the fourth quarter, Mike, that store payroll, advertising and the fixed expense categories will leverage. I think it's important to remember though that there are certain pressures out there for us and for other retailers and I'm speaking specifically about utilities and insurance costs. You know, we saw a spike in utilities at the beginning of this year and I think it's at this point it's uncertain what Q4 is going to bring, we continue to see rates running up.
I think additionally insurance costs continue to be a challenge particularly with medical costs increasing double digits and insurance premiums up significantly over the last couple of years. So I think you kind of throw that all together, and, you know, with that kind of a dynamic, we remain comfortable with the guidance for G&A for the fourth quarter.
Mike Napolitana
- JMP Securities
So you're saying that the payroll and fixed are greater than your assumptions you've laid out there at the beginning of the year offset by these higher costs in utilities and insurance?
Jeffrey Naylor
- Big Lots, Inc.  Sr. Vice President, CFO
Again, we expect payroll, advertising and fixed expense categories will leverage nicely in the quarter, that's correct.
Operator
Our next question comes from David Mann, CFA of Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.
David Mann
- Johnson Rice
Yes, on the SG&A, flexing of expenses in the third quarter, can you just elaborate a little more on where that occurred, given the sales dropped off near the end of the quarter?
 
Jeffrey Naylor
- Big Lots, Inc.  Sr. Vice President, CFO
Most of the leverage was in, David, this is Jeff. The leverage, as I described in the remarks earlier, we saw some, you know, good leverage from most of the fixed costs, whether it was occupancy, primarily in occupancy, also in our central office expenses. Really any area of the business that is more fixed in nature than variable. And we said before roughly half of the cost structure behaves in a relatively fixed way. So that would be the element, the principal elements would be central office, would be in the occupancy and occupancy-related costs in the field.
David Mann
- Johnson Rice
But to clarify, you didn't flex or cut back on expense at the end of the quarter. Is that correct?
Jeffrey Naylor
- Big Lots, Inc.  Sr. Vice President, CFO
Well, no, we flexed down, we were slightly below plan on our expenses but again, that's part of at a lower sales rate, we would expect to see that flex slightly down just as a sales increase we see a slight flex up in our G&A.
David Mann
- Johnson Rice
Okay. In terms of a bigger picture question, maybe Mike you can answer, there's been a lot of talk about how the customer is shopping closer to paydays in terms of what Wal-Mart said recently. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of how shopping patterns for your customer are trending? And also, perhaps coupled with that commentary on the percentage of sales that are coming from your ads?
Michael Potter
- Big Lots, Inc.  Chairman, President, CEO
Okay. On the first one we have, as most of you know that have followed us for a while, we have always had first of the month spikes. And that's always been a very measurable and fairly obvious spike in our business. So it's a reflection of who our core customer base is.
I would tell you that we don't see any change in that trend. It probably, we might be able to argue that ours has always been a little bit more material than some of the other discounters that are commenting on it so to the extent that they've seen a change, I don't know, maybe it's easier for them to see a change, but for us we really haven't noticed a difference. So it's definitely a phenomenon that exists but I don't think I've seen much of a change on that. I'm sorry, Dave, what was the second part of your question?
David Mann
- Johnson Rice
In terms of the percentage of sales that are coming from your circulars, can you just comment on what that trend's been maybe over the last several quarters? Up, down, same?
Michael Potter
- Big Lots, Inc.  Chairman, President, CEO
Our circulars have continued to do great. We have from the time that we cut out 10 circulars three years ago and have evolved to the level that we have now, we have offset that by increasing the productivity of the average circular by a double-digit number now for the third year in a row. That's a number we're real proud of.
Actually if you do the math on that, over that three-year period we're getting close to delivering the same kind of sales volume out of 10 less circulars than we did three years ago. So it's been a mission of quality rather than quantity in our advertising circulars. I would also say that it is likely that the circulars receive the benefit from our increased spend in TV. That  it's kind of all boats rise with the tide. So I think that's also been a phenomenon that helps.
And then of course we've mentioned that this year in terms of the additional TV investment to getting all stores nationally on the annual event, we think that's been worth a point to a point and a half in terms of the annual comps for this year. We've been very excited about what we've done with circulars and what we've done with TV.
