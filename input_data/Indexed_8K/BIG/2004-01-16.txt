On January 14, 2004, KB Acquisition Corporation and affiliated entities (collectively, "KB") filed for bankruptcy protection pursuant to Chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code. KB acquired the KB Toys business from Big Lots, Inc. (the "Big Lots") pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of December 7, 2000 (the "KB Stock Purchase Agreement").
Big Lots is currently in the process of analyzing the effect of KB's bankruptcy filing on the various continuing rights and obligations of the parties to the KB Stock Purchase Agreement. Big Lots is also analyzing the effect of the bankruptcy on an outstanding note payable from Havens Corners Corporation, a subsidiary of KB Acquisition Corporation and a party to the bankruptcy proceedings ("HCC"), to Big Lots as well as a warrant held by Big Lots to acquire common stock of KB Holdings, Inc. The note and warrant were received by Big Lots as partial consideration for the sale of the KB Toys business. The note has an aggregate principal amount of $45 million, bears interest, on an in kind basis, at the rate of 8% per annum and was carried on Big Lots' books at $16 million as of November 1, 2003. The warrant was carried on Big Lots' books at $1 million as of November 1, 2003.
As of January 14, 2004, Big Lots had less than $0.1 million outstanding receivables from KB, and Big Lots does not believe that it has received any material payments from KB within the 90 days prior to KB's bankruptcy filing.
