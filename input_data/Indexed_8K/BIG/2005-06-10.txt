Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On June 10, 2005, Big Lots, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing the selection of Steven S. Fishman as the Company's new Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. The Company and Mr. Fishman entered into an employment agreement (the "Employment Agreement") on June 6, 2005. The Employment Agreement, which is effective as of July 6, 2005, is intended to assure the Company that it will have the dedication, undivided loyalty, and objective advice and counsel from Mr. Fishman. The Employment Agreement requires that Mr. Fishman devote his full business time to the affairs of the Company and prohibits him from competing with the Company during his employment and for a one-year period thereafter. The non-competition period is reduced to six months in the event that Mr. Fishman's employment is terminated following a Change of Control, as such term is defined in the Employment Agreement.
Under the terms of the Employment Agreement, Mr. Fishman is entitled to receive an annual base salary of $960,000, which amount is not subject to an automatic increase. An annual bonus is not payable under the Employment Agreement unless the Company achieves a minimum threshold of its performance targets for the applicable fiscal year. For fiscal 2005, Mr. Fishman's bonus is subject to a maximum of 165.63% of his annual base salary and will be pro rated to reflect his service term during the fiscal year. The Nominating and Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Company's Board of Directors annually reviews the performance of the Chief Executive Officer to determine whether his base salary and/or bonus should be adjusted; provided, however, that the executive's base salary and bonus opportunity may not be reduced below the levels established in the Employment Agreement without the consent of the executive.
The Employment Agreement provides that Mr. Fishman may be terminated by the Company for Cause, as such term is defined in the Employment Agreement. If Mr. Fishman is terminated for Cause, the Company has no further obligation to pay any compensation or to provide benefits to Mr. Fishman. Should Mr. Fishman be terminated without Cause, he will become entitled to receive continued salary payments and benefits for two years and will receive a pro rata bonus (if a bonus is earned) for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs. The Employment Agreement also provides that in the event Mr. Fishman is terminated in connection with a Change of Control, he will receive a lump sum payment (net of any applicable withholding taxes) in an amount equal to 200% of his annual base salary and 200% of his maximum annual bonus opportunity, and will be entitled to receive certain plan benefits for two years. A Change of Control would also cause Mr. Fishman to receive a payment (the "Tax Gross-Up Amount") in the amount necessary to hold him harmless from the effects of Section 280G and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, which sections could subject the payments due under the Employment Agreement to excise tax liability. The compensation payable on account of a Change of Control may be subject to the deductibility limitations of Sections 162(m) and 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.
In connection with the commencement of his employment with the Company, the Employment Agreement provides that Mr. Fishman will receive (i) 100,000 restricted common shares of the Company that vest upon the earlier of the attainment of mutually agreed common share price targets or after five years of service; (ii) a non-qualified option to acquire 500,000 common shares of the Company that vests equally over four years and expires seven years after the grant date; and (iii) a one-time sign-on bonus of $750,000 that must be repaid to the Company if Mr. Fishman voluntarily terminates his employment before July 6, 2006. The restricted stock grant and the non-qualified option grant will be made pursuant to the terms of the Big Lots, Inc. 1996 Performance Incentive Plan.
With the selection of Mr. Fishman, Michael J. Potter announced his intention to resign as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President concurrent with the commencement of Mr. Fishman's employment with the Company. Consistent with these changes, on June 9, 2005, Mr. Potter and the Company amended Mr. Potter's employment agreement. The amendment provides that Mr. Potter will not serve as the Company's Chief Strategy Officer, as previously announced, but his employment with the Company will continue, subject to the terms of his employment agreement, through the original term of 24 months following the employment of a successor Chief Executive Officer.
This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Mr. Fishman's Employment Agreement and the full text of the amendment to Mr. Potter's employment agreement which are attached to this Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively.
 
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
Exhibit 10.1
This employment agreement ("Agreement") by and among Big Lots, Inc. ("BLI"), Big Lots Stores, Inc. ("Big Lots") and their affiliates, predecessor, successor, subsidiaries and other related companies (collectively the "Company") and Steven S. Fishman ("Executive"), collectively, the "Parties," is effective as of July 6, 2005 ("Effective Date") and supersedes and replaces any other oral or written agreement or understanding concerning the terms of the Executive's employment with the Company.
This Agreement will remain in effect from the Effective Date until it terminates as provided in Section 5.00 ("Term"). Any notice of termination required to be given under this Agreement must be given as provided in Section 6.00 and will be effective on the date prescribed in Section 5.00.
. The Executive agrees to serve as the Company's Chief Executive Officer and, at the discretion of BLI's Board of Directors, as the Company's President, with the authority and duties customarily associated with this position. The Executive agrees at all times to observe and to be bound by all Company rules, policies, practices, procedures and resolutions which apply to senior executive officers of the Company and which do not conflict with the specific terms of this Agreement. Promptly after the Effective Date, the Executive will be elected to BLI's Board of Directors and designated as the Chairman of the Board.
2.01 Position
. Unless the Company requires the Executive to temporarily perform duties at another location, the Executive's duties will be performed principally in Columbus, Ohio, except for travel on the business of any Group Member. The Executive will not be required to relocate his principal office or personal residence outside of the Columbus, Ohio metropolitan area without his prior written consent.
2.02 Place of Performance
The Company will pay the Executive the amounts described in Sections 3.00 and 5.00 as compensation for the services described in this Agreement and in exchange for the duties and responsibilities described in Section 4.00. In addition, on the first day of employment, the Executive will receive a grant of 100,000 restricted common shares of BLI (vesting upon the earlier of the attainment of mutually agreed BLI common share price targets or after five (5) years of service) and a non-qualified option to acquire 500,000 common shares of BLI (vesting equally over 4 years and expiring 7 years after the grant date), both grants made in accordance with the terms and conditions contained in BLI's 1996 Performance Incentive Plan.
 
. The Company will pay to the Executive an annualized base salary of $960,000, which, at the discretion of the Company, may be adjusted from time to time in a manner that is consistent with the Company's compensation policies in effect for Company employees with a similar title and position ("Base Amount") but may not be adjusted to any amount lower than $960,000 without the Executive's consent. The Executive's Base Salary will be paid in installments that correspond with the Company's normal payroll practices.
3.01 Base Salary
The Executive will be eligible to receive bonus compensation ("Bonus") under and subject to the terms of the Company's 1998 Big Lots, Inc. Key Associate Annual Compensation Plan, as amended (or any such successor plan, hereinafter, "Bonus Program") for the fiscal year beginning January 30, 2005 and for each subsequent fiscal year during the Term of this Agreement. The Executive's Bonus will be an amount equal to the Base Salary at the end of each fiscal year multiplied by the Bonus Payout percentage as determined under the Bonus Program. The Bonus Program is based upon the achievement of the Company's annual financial plan. The Executive's Bonus Payout percentage will consist of a Target Bonus of 77.08 percent of Base Salary and a Stretch Bonus of 165.63 percent of Base Salary. Both "Target Bonus" and a "Stretch Bonus" are defined in the Bonus Program and are subject to adjustment as provided in the Bonus Program; provided, however, the Executive's Target Bonus will never be set at less than 77.08 percent of Base Salary and the Executive's Stretch Bonus will never be set at less than 165.63 percent of Base Salary.

Within 15 days after the Executive's commencement of employment under this Agreement, the Company will pay to the Executive a one-time sign-on bonus of $750,000; provided, however, that if the Executive, in accordance with Section 5.05 of this Agreement, voluntarily terminates his employment within one year after the Effective Date, then the Executive agrees, on the effective date of his termination, to reimburse to the Company the entire $750,000 sign-on bonus.
3.03 Bonus upon Commencement of Employment.

Subject to their terms (which the Company may amend at any time), the Executive may participate in any Company-sponsored employee pension or welfare benefit plan at a level commensurate with the Executive's title and position.

The Executive agrees to notify the Company of any subsequent employment during the Restriction Period and any period during which any payment described in Section 5.00 is due or is being paid.
4.08 Notice of Subsequent Employment.
. The Executive:
4.09 Remedies
Acknowledges that the obligations and restrictions described in Sections 4.02 through 4.08 are reasonable in light of the nature of the Group's Business and the nature of the Executive's relationship with the Group and the Company; that the Group, the Company and all other Group Members have legitimate business reasons for requiring the Executive's agreement to all provisions of Section 4.00; and that the Executive understands these restrictions, has had an opportunity to fully discuss these restrictions with the Company and accepts the restrictions.
[1]
Agrees that if any of the obligations to the Company under Sections 4.02 through 4.08 are breached, the periods during which the obligations described in Sections 4.02 through 4.08 apply will be extended for the length of time that the Executive failed to fulfill the obligations under Sections 4.02 through 4.08.
[2]
Agrees that any breach of any of the terms of this Section 4.00 would result in irreparable injury and damage to the Group, the Company and all other Group Members for which none would have an adequate remedy at law, in the event of such a breach or any threat of such a breach by the Executive, the Group, the Company and any Group Member will be entitled to an immediate injunction and restraining order to prevent that breach and/or threatened breach and/or continued breach by the Executive and/or any and all persons and/or entities acting for, with and/or through the Executive, without having to prove damages, no bond will be required of the Group, the Company or any other Group Member in connection with an action described in Section 4.09[3][a] and not to defend any action seeking injunctive or other equitable relief referred to in Section 4.09[3][b] on the basis that the Group, the Company or any other Group Member has an adequate remedy at law in money damages or otherwise. The terms of this Section 4.09 will not prevent the Company from pursuing any other available remedies for any breach or threatened breach by the Executive of Section 4.00, including, but not limited to, the recovery of monetary damages from the Executive or specific performance. In addition to any other available remedies, the Group, the Company or any Group Member may
[3]
[a]
[b]
[c]
[d]
 
require the Executive to account for and pay over to the Company all compensation, profits, accruals, increments or other benefits derived or received by the Executive as a result of any transaction constituting a breach of any portion of Section 4.00. The Company may set off any amounts finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be due under this section against any amount that may be owed to the Executive under this Agreement or under any other compensatory arrangement (other than a tax-qualified retirement plan) between the Executive and the Group, the Company or any other Group Member. The Parties agree that any action for breach of any of the provisions of Section 4.00 and/or injunctive relief will be venued in the Court of Common Pleas, Franklin County, Ohio.
Upon termination of employment, the Executive agrees to promptly return to the Company all property then in his possession or control belonging to the Group or any Group Member; provided, however, that in the event the Executive's employment is terminated pursuant to Section 5.06 and the Executive is then utilizing an automobile provided by the Company, the Executive shall retain the automobile in accordance with the terms of Section 5.06[5].
4.10 Return of Group Property.
The provisions of Section 4.00 will survive any termination of this Agreement; and the existence of any claim or cause of action by the Executive against the Company or any Group Member, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, will not in and of itself constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Group, the Company or any other Group Member of the covenants and agreements of this Section 4.00; provided, however, that this Section 4.11 will not, in and of itself, preclude the Executive from defending against the enforceability of the covenants and agreements of Section 4.00.
4.11 Effect of Termination of Agreement.
This Agreement will terminate upon the occurrence of any of the events described in this Section 5.00, although all of the obligations, restrictions and duties described in Sections 4.02 through 4.08 will continue after this Agreement terminates and will apply and continue to apply to the Executive and the Executive's estate, heirs and assigns for the applicable period described in Sections 4.02 through 4.08.
. The following rules apply generally to the implementation of Section 5.00:
5.01 Rules of General Application
. The Company, at its option and at any time, may elect to pay, as a lump sum, any installment payments due under Section 5.00. If the Company decides to pay any installment obligation due under Section 5.00 as a lump sum, the amount payable will be reduced to its present value to reflect the value of the acceleration. This reduction will be based on the rate paid on 90-day U.S. Treasury Bills issued on the last issue date before the lump sum payment is made.
[1] Method of Payment
. Any pro rata amount to be paid under Section 5.00 will be calculated as provided in the program through which the payment is due or if the payment obligation arises solely under this Agreement, will be based on the
[2] Application of Pro Rata
[a]
[b]
 
number of days between the first day of the fiscal year during which the Executive terminates employment and the date that the Executive terminates employment divided by the number of days in the fiscal year during which the Executive terminates employment.
. Subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the payments described in this section will be made at the time and in the form described in this section. Any amount deferred by application of Section 409A of the Code will be paid as a lump sum on the first payment date permitted under Section 409A of the Code and will be increased by interest calculated as described in Section 5.01[1] or on another basis permitted under Section 409A of the Code.
[3] Limit on Time and Form of Payment
. This Agreement will terminate automatically on the date the Executive dies. If all requirements of this Agreement are met (including those described in Section 7.00), as of the Executive's date of death, and subject to Section 5.04[5], the Company will make the following payments to the beneficiary the Executive designates on a form acceptable to the Company.

[4] Protection Period.
For purposes of this Agreement, "Termination in Connection With a Change of Control" or "Terminated in connection with a Change of Control" means, at any time during the Protection Period, the Change Entity:
[5] Termination or Terminated in Connection With a Change of Control.
Involuntarily terminates the Executive without Cause (as defined in Section 5.06), in which case the termination will be deemed to have occurred on the date the notice of termination is delivered to the executive;
[a]

[b]
Unsuccessfully attempts to terminate the Executive for Cause (as defined in Section 5.04), in which case the termination will be deemed to have occurred on the date the Change Entity gives the notice of termination for Cause described in Section 5.04 even if the date on which it is determined that the Change Entity had no basis for terminating the executive for Cause is beyond the Protection Period;
[c]
 
Attempts to terminate the Executive for any reason without following the procedures described in this Agreement (including an acceleration of the periods described in Section 5.03[4] and 5.04[b]), in which case the termination will be deemed to have occurred on the date the Change Entity first failed to comply with those procedures;
[d]

If payments under this Agreement, when combined with payments and benefits under all other plans and programs maintained by the Company or the Change Entity, constitute "excess" parachute payments as defined in Section 280G(b) of the Code, the Change Entity, subject to Section 5.07[7], will either:
[6] Treatment of Taxes.
Reimburse the Executive for the amount of any excise tax due under Code 4999, if this procedure provides the Executive with an after-tax amount that is larger than the after-tax amount produced under Section 5.07[6][b]; or
[a]
Reduce the Executive's benefits under this Agreement so that the Executive's total "parachute payment" as defined in Code 280G(b)(2)(A) under this Agreement and all other agreements will be $1.00 less than the amount that would generate "excess" parachute payment penalties if this procedure provides the Executive with an after-tax amount that is larger than the after-tax amount produced under Section 5.07[6][a].
[b]
This comparison will be made as of the date of the corporate event generating the "parachute payments" although any reimbursement provided under Section 5.07[6][a] will be made when the parachute payment is actually made or distributed.
Within 10 business days of the date the Change Entity determines that Section 5.07[6][b] should be applied, the Change Entity will apprise the Executive of the amount of the reduction ("Notice of Reduction"). Within 10 business days after receiving the Notice of Reduction, the Executive may specify how (and against which benefit or payment source) the reduction is to be applied ("Notice of Allocation"). The Change Entity will be
 
required to implement these directions within 10 business days after receiving the Notice of Allocation. If the Change Entity has not received a Notice of Allocation from the Executive within 10 business days after the date of the Notice of Reduction or if the allocation provided in the Notice of Allocation is not sufficient to fully implement Section 5.07[6][b], then the Change Entity will apply Section 5.07[6][b] proportionately based on the amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement or, if a Notice of Allocation has been returned that does not sufficiently implement Section 5.07[6][b], on the basis of the reductions specified in the Notice of Allocation.
The Change Entity will establish procedures that will apply to any inquiries regarding the treatment of tax payments under this Section 5.07. Within 30 days following the termination of the Executive's employment under Section 5.07, the Change Entity will provide the Executive with a copy of such procedures.
[7] Effect of Subsequent Tax Claim.
If at any time during the Term of this Agreement the Company or a Change Entity materially adversely changes or causes a diminution in the Executive's reporting relationship, job description, duties, responsibilities, compensation, perquisites, office or location of employment (as reasonably determined by the Executive is his good faith discretion), such action by the Company or Change Entity shall constitute a constructive termination of the Executive's employment by the Company without Cause, the Executive shall be entitled to resign from his offices and positions with the Company and shall not be obligated to perform any further services of any kind for the Company and the Executive shall be entitled to receive from the Company (and the Change Entity, if applicable) at the applicable times all of the compensation, benefits and other payments described in Section 5.06 or 5.07 (whichever may be applicable); provided, however, that the Executive shall notify the Company in writing at least forty five (45) days in advance of any election by the Executive to terminate his employment hereunder, specifying the nature of the alleged adverse change or diminution, and the Company shall have a period of ten (10) business days after the receipt of such notice to cure such alleged adverse change or diminution before the Executive shall be entitled to exercise any such rights and remedies.

[1]
[2]
. Any notice permitted or required to be given under this Agreement will be deemed to have been given and will be effective on the date it is delivered.

The Executive agrees that as a condition of receiving any post-termination benefit as set forth in Section 5.00, except for earned but unpaid Base Salary to the date of termination and any legally protected rights the Executive has under any employee benefit plan maintained by the Company, the Executive or, in the case of any amounts due after the Executive's death, the person to whom those amounts are payable (collectively, the "Payee") must execute a comprehensive release in the form determined from time to time by the Company in its sole reasonable discretion. Generally, the release will require the Payee and the Payee's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees, legatees and assigns to release and forever discharge the Group, the Company and all other Group Members, past, present and future, and their executives, officers, directors, agents, attorneys, successors and assigns from any and all claims, suits and/or causes of action that grow out of or are in any way related to the Executive's recruitment and employment with the Company and arose on or prior to the date of the release (whether known or unknown to the Executive), other than any claim that the Company has breached this Agreement. This release will include, but not be limited to, any claim that the Company violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act; the Older Worker's Benefit Protection Act; the Americans with Disabilities Act; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Family and Medical Leave Act; any state, federal law or local ordinance prohibiting discrimination, harassment or retaliation in employment; any claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy, claims of promissory estoppel or detrimental reliance, defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress; or the public policy of any state; or any federal, state or local law (each as in effect on the Effective Date and as subsequently amended) relating to any matter within the purview of this Agreement. Upon the Executive's termination of employment with all Group Members, the Payee will be presented with a release and if the Payee fails to execute the release, the Payee agrees to forego any payment described in the first sentence of this section. The Executive acknowledges that the Executive is an experienced senior executive knowledgeable about the claims that might arise in the course of employment with and termination from the Company and any other Group Member and knowingly agrees that the payments upon termination provided for in this Agreement are satisfactory consideration for the release of all possible claims described in the release.
The Company will indemnify Executive (including his heirs, executors and administrators) to the fullest extent permitted under the Company's Regulations and Ohio law and will cause the Executive to be covered by all directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company. This obligation to provide insurance for the Executive will survive termination of this Agreement with respect to proceedings or threatened proceedings based on acts or omissions occurring during the Executive's employment with or termination from the Group, the Company or with any other Group Member. Concurrently wit the execution of this Agreement, BLI will enter into an indemnification agreement with the Executive.
 
Unless stated otherwise in this Agreement or any other compensatory or any employee benefit plan, fund or program maintained by the Company, the Parties agree that arbitration is the sole and exclusive remedy for each of them to resolve (except as specifically provided in Section 4.09) and redress any dispute, claim or controversy involving the interpretation or application of this Agreement, the terms, conditions or termination of this Agreement and the terms, conditions or termination of the Executive's employment with the Company, including any claims for any tort, breach of contract, violation of public policy or discrimination, whether such claim arises under federal, state law or local law.
9.01 Acknowledgement of Arbitration.
. The Executive expressly understands and agrees that claims subject to arbitration under this section include asserted violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act; the Older Worker's Benefit Protection Act; the Americans with Disabilities Act; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (as amended); the Family and Medical Leave Act; any federal, state or local law or ordinances prohibiting discrimination, harassment or retaliation in employment; any claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy, claims of promissory estoppel or detrimental reliance, defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress; or the public policy of any state, or any federal, state or local law (each as in effect on the Effective Date or as subsequently amended) relating to any matter within the purview of this Agreement.
9.02 Scope of Arbitration
. The Parties intend that any arbitration award relating to any matter described in Section 9.01 will be final and binding on them and that a judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction and that enforcement may be had according to the terms of that award. This Section 9.03 will survive the termination of this Agreement.
9.03 Effect of Arbitration
. Arbitration will be held in Columbus, Ohio, and will be conducted by a retired federal judge or other qualified arbitrator. The arbitrator will be mutually agreed upon by the Parties and the arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes of the American Arbitration Association. The Parties will have the right to conduct discovery pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; provided, however, that the arbitrator will have the authority to establish an expedited discovery schedule and cutoff and to resolve any discovery disputes. The arbitrator will have no jurisdiction or authority to change any provision of this Agreement by alterations of, additions to or subtractions from the terms of this Agreement. The arbitrator's sole authority will be to interpret or apply any provision(s) of this Agreement or any public law alleged to have been violated. The arbitrator has the authority to award damages and other relief expressly provided by law.
9.04 Location and Conduct of Arbitration
. Any claim or controversy relating to any matter described in Section 9.01 not sought to be submitted to arbitration, in writing, within 90 days after the date the Party asserting the claim knew, or through reasonable diligence should have known, of the facts giving rise to that Party's claim, will be deemed waived; and the Party asserting the claim will have no further right to seek arbitration or recovery with respect to that claim or controversy. Both Parties agree to strictly comply with the time limitation specified in
9.05 Time for Initiating Arbitration
 
this Section 9.05. For purposes of this Section 9.05, a claim or controversy is sought to be submitted to arbitration on the date the complaining Party gives written notice to the other party that an issue has arisen or is likely to arise that, unless resolved otherwise, may be resolved through arbitration under this Section 9.00 and unless the issue is resolved otherwise, the complaining Party intends to submit the matter to arbitration under the terms of Section 9.00.
[1]
[2]
. The Company will bear the arbitrator's fee and other costs associated with any arbitration, unless the arbitrator, acting under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1), elects to award these fees to the Company. Attorney's fees may be awarded to the prevailing party if expressly authorized by statute, or otherwise each party will bear its own attorney's fees and costs, but the Executive's attorney's fees and other associated costs and expenses will be borne by the Change Entity with respect to any claim arising under Section 5.07 but only if the arbitrator concludes the claim legitimately relates to matters within the contemplation of Section 5.07 (otherwise, the rule described in Section 9.06[1] will apply).
9.06 Costs of Arbitration and Attorney's Fees
[1]
[2]
. The Parties acknowledge that, because arbitration is the exclusive remedy for resolving the issues described in Section 9.01, neither Party may resort to any federal, state or local court or administrative agency concerning those issues and that the decision of the arbitrator will be a complete defense to any suit, action or proceeding instituted in any federal, state or local court before any administrative agency with respect to any arbitrable claim or controversy.
9.07 Arbitration Exclusive Remedy
. The Executive (personally and in behalf of all the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees, legatees and assigns) and the Company (on its own behalf and on behalf of its successors, including any Change Entity) each waive the right to have a claim or dispute with one another decided in a judicial forum or by a jury, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.
9.08 Waiver of Jury
. The Executive represents and warrants that the Executive is an experienced senior executive knowledgeable about the matters (and their effect) within the purview of this Agreement and is not under any contractual or legal restraint that prevents or prohibits the Executive from entering into this Agreement or performing the duties and obligations described in this Agreement.
10.01 Representation of Executive
. No provision of this Agreement may be modified or waived except in a document signed by the Executive and the Company's Chief Executive Officer (other than the Executive) or other person designated by the BLI's Board of Directors. This Agreement, and any attachments referenced in the Agreement, constitute the entire agreement between the Parties regarding the employment relationship described in this Agreement, and, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, any other agreements between the Executive and the Company are terminated and of no further force or legal effect. No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, with respect to the Executive's employment relationship with the Company have been made or relied upon by either Party which are not set forth expressly in this Agreement.
10.02 Modification or Waiver; Entire Agreement
 
. This Agreement is intended to be performed in accordance with, and only to the extent permitted by, all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of any provision of this Agreement to any person or circumstance, is, for any reason and to any extent, held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity and unenforceability will not affect the remaining provisions of this Agreement of its application to other persons or circumstances, all of which will be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by law; and the Parties agree that any invalid or unenforceable provision may and will be reformed and applied as provided in Section 4.05, with respect to the matters specifically contemplated in Section 4.00 and with respect to other matters, to the extent needed to avoid that invalidity or unenforceability and in a manner that is as similar as possible to the Parties' intent (as described in this Agreement) and preserves the essential economic substance and effect of this Agreement. The validity, construction and interpretation of this Agreement and the rights and duties of the Parties will be governed by the laws of the State of Ohio, without reference to the Ohio choice of law rules.
10.03 Governing Law; Severability
[1]
[2]
[a]
[b]
. Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.05, failure to insist upon strict compliance with any term of this Agreement will not be considered a waiver of any such term or any other term of this Agreement.
10.04 No Waiver
. All payments made to or on behalf of the Executive under this Agreement will be reduced by any amount:
10.05 Withholding
That the Company is required by law to withhold in advance payment of the Executive's federal, state and local income, wage and employment tax liability; and
[1]
To the extent determined in accordance with Sections 5.04[5] or 9.00, that the Executive owes to the Group, the Company or any other Group Member.
[2]
Application of Section 10.05[2] will not extinguish the Company's right to seek additional amounts from the Executive (or to pursue other appropriate remedies) to the extent that the amount recovered by application of Section 10.05[2] does not fully discharge the amount the Executive owes to the Group, the Company or other Group Member and does not preclude the Group, the Company or any other Group Member from proceeding directly against the Executive without first exhausting its right of recovery under Section 10.05[2].
. The Parties agree that the covenants and promises set forth in this Agreement will survive the termination of this Agreement and continue in full force and effect after this Agreement terminates to the extent that their performance is required to occur after this Agreement terminates.
10.06 Survival
.
10.07 Miscellaneous
The Executive may not assign any right or interest to, or in, any payments payable under this Agreement until they have become due from the Company; provided, however, that this prohibition does not preclude the Executive from designating in writing one or more beneficiaries to receive any amount that may be payable after the Executive's death and does not preclude the legal representative of the Executive's estate from assigning any right under this Agreement to the person or persons entitled to it.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Media Contact: Keri Lucas Director of Public Relations 614.278.7023
COLUMBUS, OH (June 10, 2005)  Big Lots, America's largest broadline closeout retailer, today announced the selection of Steven S. Fishman as the company's chairman, chief executive officer, and president.
Fishman (54) is a well-respected chief executive officer and merchandising veteran with demonstrated experience in improving company performance. He led the rebirth of the retail chain Pamida and was responsible for the strategic repositioning of Frank's Nursery & Crafts and Rhodes Furniture.
"It's a very exciting time for Steve to be joining the company and leading Big Lots into the future," noted David T. Kollat, chairman of the search committee and a Big Lots board member. "With his experience as a successful chief executive officer in several retailing companies, his strong merchandise experience, his outstanding leadership skills and entrepreneurial spirit, and his consistent record of enhancing shareholder value, we are confident Steve can lead Big Lots to its full potential."
Upon his selection, Fishman stated, "It's an honor for me to become involved with the rich history of success and tradition found at Big Lots. I am impressed with the strategic accomplishments the executive team has executed over the past few years, and I look forward to helping the company further differentiate and leverage its niche as the nation's closeout leader."
With over 30 years of retail expertise, Fishman's understanding of the complex discount retail environment was a nice match for the Fortune 500 retailer. Under the direction of a search committee comprised of independent members of Big Lots' board of directors, Korn/Ferry International conducted the search. Fishman emerged as the ideal candidate based on his proven record of success and competitive spirit.
 
Big Lots Fishman Announcement/2
Mr. Fishman will replace Michael J. Potter who in January announced his intention to step down from the CEO position in order to relocate his family back to the West Coast. Mr. Potter is also announcing his intention to resign from the board of directors concurrent with Fishman's arrival. "I have been very impressed with the search committee's intensity and diligence throughout this process," noted Mr. Potter. "As we approached the end of the search, it became apparent to the board and me that this change would be in the best interest of the company going forward." Commenting on his tenure at Big Lots, Potter stated, "I have been very fortunate to have worked with such a talented team of associates across the country. Together we have worked to build a strong foundation for future success and have truly reshaped Big Lots. I continue to be optimistic about the company's future."
"Mike's accomplishments as CEO have been significant as the Big Lots brand is growing in national recognition and is well respected," Kollat said. "The board of directors is extremely grateful to Mike for his dedication over the past 14 years and specifically his leadership as chairman and CEO for the past five. With a solid foundation in place after successfully executing a number of strategic initiatives, I'm sure the more than 46,000 associates join me in acknowledging Mike for his many contributions."
Mr. Fishman anticipates joining the company in early July. He and his family look forward to once again being members of the Columbus community.
About Steve Fishman
After serving on the Rhodes board of directors for five years, Fishman was asked in 2004 to step into the role of president/CEO, and chief restructuring officer in order to strategically reposition the business and improve its operating performance. "The majority of my work at Rhodes is complete, and I feel confident we are on track with our goal of filing a plan of reorganization," stated Fishman.
Prior to Rhodes, Mr. Fishman was the chairman and CEO of Frank's Nursery & Crafts, where he was recruited to accomplish similar repositioning objectives. Under Fishman's leadership, Frank's profitability was dramatically improved; the company emerged from bankruptcy and completed a public offering in less than one year.
From 1993 to 1999, Fishman led Pamida, Inc., as chairman and chief executive officer. Pamida, formerly a publicly held retailer and now a subsidiary of ShopKo Stores, has approximately 220 general merchandise discount stores in 16 states. The stores average 27,000 square feet in size and are located in small towns serving a moderate-income consumer. During Fishman's tenure, Pamida developed a strategy to compete in an increasingly difficult retail environment, grew sales and profit dramatically, and delivered significant returns for shareholders. In 1999, Pamida was acquired by ShopKo Stores.

Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements for Purposes of "Safe Harbor" Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the "Act") provides a "safe harbor" for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information, so long as those statements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the statements. The Company wishes to take advantage of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Act.
This release, as well as other verbal or written statements or reports made by or on the behalf of the Company, may contain or may incorporate material by reference which includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Statements, other than those based on historical facts, which address activities, events, or developments that the Company expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future, including such things as future capital expenditures (including the amount and nature thereof), business strategy, expansion and growth of the Company's business and operations, future earnings, store openings and new market entries, anticipated inventory turn, and other similar matters, as well as statements expressing optimism or pessimism about future operating results or events, are forward-looking statements, which are based upon a number of assumptions concerning future conditions that may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. The words "believe," "anticipate," "project," "plan," "expect," "estimate," "objective," "forecast," "goal," "intend," and similar expressions generally identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are and will be based upon management's then-current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance, and are applicable only as of the dates of such statements. Although the Company believes the expectations expressed in forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business, actual events and results may materially differ from anticipated results described in such statements.
The Company's ability to achieve the results contemplated by forward-looking statements is subject to a number of factors, any one, or a combination, of which could materially affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. These factors may include, but are not limited to:
 
 
The foregoing list is not exhaustive. There can be no assurances that the Company has correctly and completely identified, assessed, and accounted for all factors that do or may affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Additional risks not presently known to the Company or that it believes to be immaterial also may adversely impact the Company. Should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have material adverse effects on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements are qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance that the results or developments anticipated by the Company will be realized or that they will have the expected effects on the Company or its business or operations.
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date thereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to the forward-looking statements contained in this release, or to update them to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this release, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Readers are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures the Company may make on related subjects in its public announcements and SEC filings.
