Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
On September 28, 2006, under the threat of eminent domain, a subsidiary of Big Lots, Inc. (collectively referred to as the "Company") sold an owned store property in California (the "Premises"). As part of the sale, the Company entered into a lease which permits it to occupy and operate a store at the Premises through January 2009, in exchange for one dollar ($1) per year, plus the cost of taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges. The Company may vacate the property at any time without liability.
Due to the Company's continuing involvement with the Premises at below market rent, the sale does not qualify for sale-leaseback accounting in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 98, . Instead, the sale is being recognized as a finance obligation under the provisions of SFAS No. 66, In accordance with SFAS No. 66, the carrying value of the property of approximately $0.5 million is expected to remain on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at October 28, 2006. The net sale proceeds of approximately $13.3 million are expected to be recorded as a long-term real estate liability, with an estimated maturity date of January 2009, included in other liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The Company expects to defer recognition of the estimated $12.8 million gain on the sale of the property until the end of the lease when its continuing involvement in the property ceases.
