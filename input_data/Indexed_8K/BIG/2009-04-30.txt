On April 28, 2009, Big Lots, Inc. (Big Lots), its wholly-owned subsidiary Big Lots Stores, Inc. (BLSI), and certain of its other direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries (together with Big Lots and BLSI, we, us or our) entered into a new $500 million three-year unsecured credit facility (2009 Credit Agreement).  The 2009 Credit Agreement replaces the $500 million five-year unsecured credit facility we entered into on October 29, 2004 (2004 Credit Agreement).
The 2004 Credit Agreement was entered into by and among BLSI, as borrower, Big Lots and certain other subsidiaries named therein, as guarantors, the Banks named therein, PNC Bank, National Association, as syndication agent for the Banks, National City Bank, as administrative agent for the Banks, and Wachovia Bank, N.A., as documentation agent for the Banks.  The 2004 Credit Agreement was scheduled to expire on October 28, 2009, but was terminated concurrent with the 2009 Credit Agreement becoming effective on April 28, 2009.  We did not incur any material early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the 2004 Credit Agreement.
The 2009 Credit Agreement was entered into by and among BLSI, as borrower, Big Lots and certain other subsidiaries named therein, as guarantors, the Banks named therein, PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the Banks, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as syndication agent for the Banks, and U.S. Bank National Association, Branch Banking and Trust Company, Compass Bank and The Huntington National Bank, each as a documentation agent for the Banks.  The 2009 Credit Agreement expires on April 28, 2012.  The proceeds of the 2009 Credit Agreement are available for general corporate purposes, working capital, and to repay certain of our indebtedness, including amounts due under the 2004 Credit Agreement.  The 2009 Credit Agreement includes a $150 million letter of credit sublimit and a $30 million swing loan sublimit.  The interest rates, pricing and fees under the 2009 Credit Agreement fluctuate based on BLSIs debt rating.  Loans made under the 2009 Credit Agreement may be prepaid by BLSI.  The 2009 Credit Agreement contains financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on indebtedness, liens and investments, as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios  a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio.  A violation of these covenants could result in a default under the 2009 Credit Agreement which would permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access the 2009 Credit Agreement for loans and letters of credit and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans under the 2009 Credit Agreement.  Other than the issuance of letters of credit, which totaled $52.6 million at closing, we have not incurred any indebtedness under the 2009 Credit Agreement.  Certain of the lenders who are a party to the 2009 Credit Agreement provide us with commercial banking, trustee and custodial services.
In order for us to make investments in Big Lots Capital, Inc. (BLCI), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of BLSI but is not a guarantor to the 2009 Credit Agreement, the 2009 Credit Agreement requires that Big Lots, BLSI or another subsidiary guarantor take a security interest in substantially all of the personal property of BLCI.  Because this same requirement existed under the 2004 Credit Agreement, we previously satisfied, and continue to satisfy, this obligation through the Security Agreement entered into by and between BLSI and BLCI on October 29, 2004.
A copy of the 2009 Credit Agreement is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1.  The foregoing description of the 2009 Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2009 Credit Agreement which is incorporated herein by reference.

Within such limits of time and amount and subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow pursuant to this Section 2.1.1.
Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, and in order to facilitate loans and repayments between Settlement Dates, PNC Bank may, at its option, cancelable at any time for any reason whatsoever, make swing loans (the "Swing Loans") to the Borrower at any time or from time to time after the date hereof to, but not including, the Expiration Date, in an aggregate principal amount up to but not in excess of Thirty Million and 00/100 Dollars ($30,000,000.00) (the "Swing Loan Commitment"), provided that the aggregate principal amount of PNC Bank's Swing Loans and the Revolving Credit Loans of all the Banks and the Letters of Credit Outstanding at any one time outstanding shall not exceed the Revolving Credit Commitments of all the Banks.

In addition to amounts payable as provided in Section 9.5 [Reimbursement and Indemnification of Administrative Agent by Loan Parties],the Loan Parties hereby agree to protect, indemnify, pay and save harmless the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank and any of the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank's Affiliates that has issued a Letter of Credit from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, taxes, penalties, interest, judgments, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of counsel and allocated costs of internal counsel) which the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank or any of the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank's Affiliates may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of the issuance of any Letter of Credit, other than as a result of (A) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank or any of the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank's Affiliates as determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or (B) the wrongful dishonor by the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank or any of the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank's Affiliates of a proper demand for payment made under any Letter of Credit, except if such dishonor resulted from any act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto government or governmental authority (all such acts or omissions herein called "Governmental Acts").
 
As between any Loan Party and the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank, or the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank's Affiliates, such Loan Party assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit by, the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank shall not be responsible for any of the following including any losses or damages to any Loan Party or other Person or property relating therefrom:  (i) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection with the application for an issuance of any such Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged (even if the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank or the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank's Affiliates shall have been notified thereof); (ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) the failure of the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit, or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred, to comply fully with any conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit or any other claim of any Loan Party against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit, or any such transferee, or any dispute between or among any Loan Party and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any such transferee; (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, electronic mail, cable, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any such Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank or the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank's Affiliates, as applicable, including any Governmental Acts, and none of the above shall affect or impair, or prevent the vesting of, any of the Issuing Letter of Credit Banks or the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank's Affiliates rights or powers hereunder.  Nothing in the preceding sentence shall relieve the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank from liability for the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with actions or omissions described in such clauses (i) through (viii) of such sentence.  In no event shall the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank or the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank's Affiliates be liable to any Loan Party for any indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or special damages or expenses (including without limitation attorneys' fees), or for any damages resulting from any change in the value of any property relating to a Letter of Credit.
 
- 35 -
 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, including the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank not being relieved of liability for gross negligence or willful misconduct, the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank and each of its Affiliates (i) may rely on any oral or other communication believed in good faith by the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank or such Affiliate to have been authorized or given by or on behalf of the applicant Loan Party for a Letter of Credit, (ii) may honor any presentation if the documents presented appear on their face substantially to comply with the terms and conditions of the relevant Letter of Credit; (iii) may honor a previously dishonored presentation under a Letter of Credit, whether such dishonor was pursuant to a court order, to settle or compromise any claim of wrongful dishonor, or otherwise, and shall be entitled to reimbursement to the same extent as if such presentation had initially been honored, together with any interest paid by the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank or its Affiliate; (iv) may honor any drawing that is payable upon presentation of a statement advising negotiation or payment, upon receipt of such statement (even if such statement indicates that a draft or other document is being delivered separately), and shall not be liable for any failure of any such draft or other document to arrive, or to conform in any way with the relevant Letter of Credit; (v) may pay any paying or negotiating bank claiming that it rightfully honored under the Laws or practices of the place where such bank is located; and (vi) may settle or adjust any claim or demand made on the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank or its Affiliate in any way related to any order issued at the applicant's request to an air carrier, a letter of guarantee or of indemnity issued to a carrier or any similar document (each an "Order") and honor any drawing in connection with any Letter of Credit that is the subject to such Order, notwithstanding that any drafts or other documents presented in connection with such Letter of Credit fail to conform in any way with such Letter of Credit.
 
- 36 -
 
In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific provisions set forth above, any action taken or omitted by the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank or the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank's Affiliates under or in connection with the Letters of Credit issued by it or any documents and certificates delivered thereunder, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank or the Issuing Letter of Credit Bank's Affiliates under any resulting liability to the Borrower or any Bank.
The Borrower may, upon at least five (5) Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate at any time, or permanently reduce from time to time by an aggregate amount of at least Ten Million and 00/100 Dollars ($10,000,000.00) or any larger multiple of One Million and 00/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00), the Revolving Credit Commitments.  Each such permanent reduction shall permanently reduce the Banks' Revolving Credit Commitments ratably in proportion to their respective Ratable Share of the Revolving Credit Commitments.  If the Revolving Credit Commitments are terminated in their entirety, all accrued fees shall be payable on the effective date of such termination.  The Administrative Agent shall, promptly after receipt by it of a notice pursuant to this Section 2.9, notify the Banks of its receipt of such notice and the nature of the same.
3.           
INTEREST RATES
The Borrower shall pay interest in respect of the outstanding unpaid principal amount of the Loans as selected by it from the Base Rate Option or Euro-Rate Option set forth below applicable to the Loans, it being understood that, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Borrower may select different Interest Rate Options and different Interest Periods to apply simultaneously to the Loans comprising different Borrowing Tranches and may convert to or renew one or more Interest Rate Options with respect to all or any portion of the Loans comprising any Borrowing Tranche, that there shall not be at any one time outstanding more than ten (10) Borrowing Tranches in the aggregate among all of the Loans (including a Borrowing Tranche to which the Base Rate Option applies), and provided further that only the Base Rate Option (including the Applicable Margin with respect thereto) or such other interest rates as PNC Bank and the Borrower may agree to from time to time shall apply to the Swing Loans.  Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Borrower shall not be required to pay, and the Banks shall not be permitted to collect, any amount of interest in excess of the maximum amount of interest permitted by applicable Law ("Excess Interest").  If any Excess Interest is provided for or determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been provided for in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, then, in such event:  (1) the provisions of this subsection shall govern and control; (2) the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any Excess Interest; (3) any Excess Interest that the Banks may have received hereunder shall be, at the option of the Required Banks, (a) applied as a credit against the outstanding principal balance of the Obligations or accrued and unpaid interest (not to exceed the maximum amount permitted by Law), (b) refunded to the payor thereof, or (c) any combination of the foregoing; (4) the interest rates provided for herein shall be automatically reduced to the maximum lawful rate allowed from time to time under applicable Law, and this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be deemed to have been and shall be reformed and modified to reflect such reduction; and (5) the Borrower shall have no action against the Administrative Agent or any Bank for any damages arising out of the payment or collection of any Excess Interest (other than to enforce this Section 3.1).
provided

The Borrower shall have the right to select from the following Interest Rate Options applicable to the Revolving Credit Loans:
(i)             :  A fluctuating rate per annum (computed on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty (360) days and actual days elapsed) equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, such interest rate to change automatically from time to time effective as of the effective date of each change in the Base Rate; or
Base Rate Option
 
(ii)            :  A rate per annum (computed on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty (360) days and actual days elapsed) equal to the Euro-Rate plus the Applicable Margin.
Euro-Rate Option
The Borrower may call the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which a Loan Request is to be delivered to receive an indication of the rates then in effect, but it is acknowledged that such projection shall not be binding on the Administrative Agent or the Banks nor affect the rate of interest which thereafter is actually in effect when the election is made.
If the Applicable Margin, Applicable Commercial Letter of Credit Fee Percentage, Applicable Standby Letter of Credit Fee Percentage or Applicable Facility Fee Percentage is increased or reduced with respect to any period for which the Borrower has already paid interest, Letter of Credit Fees or Facility Fees, the Administrative Agent shall recalculate the additional or lesser interest, Letter of Credit Fees or Facility Fees due from or to the Borrower and shall, at least five (5) Business Days prior to next subsequent interest payment date occurring after the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent of such increase or decrease, give the Borrower and the Banks notice of such recalculation.
3.1.3.1      Any additional interest, Letter of Credit Fee or Facility Fee due from the Borrower shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks on the next date on which an interest, Letter of Credit Fee or Facility Fee payment is due; , , that if there are no Loans outstanding or if the Loans are due and payable, such additional interest, Letter of Credit Fee or Facility Fee shall be paid not later than five (5) Business Days after receipt of written request for payment from the Administrative Agent.
provided
however
3.1.3.2      Any interest, Letter of Credit Fee or Facility Fee refund due to the Borrower shall be credited against payments otherwise due from the Borrower on the next interest, Letter of Credit Fee or Facility Fee payment due date or, if the Loans have been repaid and the Banks are no longer committed to lend under this Agreement, the Banks shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Borrower such interest, Letter of Credit Fee or Facility Fee refund not later than five (5) Business Days after written notice from the Administrative Agent to the Banks.
 
- 38 -
 
At any time when the Borrower shall select, convert to or renew a Loan to which the Euro-Rate Option applies, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent thereof at least three (3) Business Days prior to the effective date of such Loan by delivering a Loan Request.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the notice shall specify an Interest Period during which such Euro-Rate Option shall apply.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the case of the renewal of a Loan to which the Euro-Rate Option applies at the end of an Interest Period, the first day of the new Interest Period shall be the last day of the preceding Interest Period, without duplication in payment of interest for such day.
To the extent permitted by Law, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and until such time such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived:
the rate of interest for each Loan otherwise applicable pursuant to Section 3.1 [Interest Rate Options], shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the rate of interest applicable under the Base Rate Option plus an additional two percent (2.0%) per annum, each Borrowing Tranche to which the Euro-Rate Option applies shall automatically convert to the applicable Base Rate Option at the end of the applicable Interest Period and no Loans may be made as, renewed or converted into a Borrowing Tranche to which the Euro-Rate Option applies;
the Letter of Credit Fees otherwise applicable pursuant to Section 2.8.2 [Letter of Credit Fees] shall be increased by two percent (2.0%) per annum;
each other Obligation hereunder if not paid when due shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the rate of interest applicable under the Base Rate Option plus an additional two percent (2.0%) per annum from the time such Obligation becomes due and payable and until it is paid in full; and
the Borrower acknowledges that the increase in rates referred to in this Section 3.3 [Interest After Default] reflects, among other things, the fact that such Loans or other amounts have become a substantially greater risk given their default status and that the Banks are entitled to additional compensation for such risk; and all such interest shall be payable by Borrower upon demand by Administrative Agent.
 
- 39 -
 
If on any date on which a Euro-Rate would otherwise be determined with respect to Loans, the Administrative Agent shall have determined that:
(i)             adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining such Euro-Rate, or
(ii)            a contingency has occurred which materially and adversely affects the London interbank eurodollar market relating to the Euro-Rate,
then the Administrative Agent shall have the rights specified in Section 3.4.3 [Administrative Agent's and Bank's Rights].
If at any time any Bank shall have determined that:
(i)             the making, maintenance or funding of any Loan to which a Euro-Rate Option applies has been made impracticable or unlawful by compliance by such Bank in good faith with any Law or any interpretation or application thereof by any Official Body or with any request or directive of any such Official Body (whether or not having the force of Law), or
(ii)            such Euro-Rate Option will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Bank of the establishment or maintenance of any such Loan, or
(iii)           after making all reasonable efforts, deposits of the relevant amount in Dollars for the relevant Interest Period for a Loan, or to banks generally, to which a Euro-Rate Option applies, respectively, are not available to such Bank with respect to such Loan, or to banks generally, in the interbank eurodollar market,
then the Administrative Agent shall have the rights specified in Section 3.4.3 [Administrative Agent's and Bank's Rights].
In the case of any event specified in Section 3.4.1 [Unascertainable] above, the Administrative Agent shall promptly so notify the Banks and the Borrower thereof, and in the case of an event specified in Section 3.4.2 [Illegality; Increased Costs; Etc.] above, such Bank shall promptly so notify the Administrative Agent and endorse a certificate to such notice as to the specific circumstances of such notice, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly send copies of such notice and certificate to the other Banks and the Borrower.  Upon such date as shall be specified in such notice (which shall not be earlier than the date such notice is given), the obligation of (A) the Banks, in the case of such notice given by the Administrative Agent, or (B) such Bank, in the case of such notice given by such Bank, to allow the Borrower to select, convert to or renew a Euro-Rate Option shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall have later notified the Borrower, or such Bank shall have later notified the Administrative Agent, of the Administrative Agent's or such Bank's, as the case may be, determination that the circumstances giving rise to such previous determination no longer exist.  If at any time the Administrative Agent makes a determination under Section 3.4.1 [Unascertainable] and the Borrower has previously notified the Administrative Agent of its selection of, conversion to or renewal of a Euro-Rate Option and such Interest Rate Option has not yet gone into effect, such notification shall be deemed to provide for the selection of, conversion to or renewal of the Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loans.  If any Bank notifies the Administrative Agent of a determination under Section 3.4.2 [Illegality; Increased Costs; Etc.], the Borrower shall, subject to the Borrower's indemnification Obligations under Section 4.6.2 [Indemnity], as to any Loan of the Bank to which a Euro-Rate Option applies, on the date specified in such notice either convert such Loan to the Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loan or prepay such Loan in accordance with Section 4.4 [Voluntary Prepayments].  Absent due notice from the Borrower of conversion or prepayment, such Loan shall automatically be converted to the Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loan upon such specified date.
 
- 40 -
 
If the Borrower fails to select a new Interest Period to apply to any Borrowing Tranche of Loans under the Euro-Rate Option at the expiration of an existing Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing Tranche in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.2 [Interest Periods], the Borrower shall be deemed to have converted such Borrowing Tranche to the Base Rate Option commencing upon the last day of the existing Interest Period.
4.           
PAYMENTS
All payments and prepayments to be made in respect of principal, interest, Facility Fees, Letter of Credit Fees, Administrative Agent's Fee or other fees or amounts due from the Borrower hereunder shall be payable prior to 12:00 noon, Columbus, Ohio time, on the date when due without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower, without set-off, counterclaim or other deduction of any nature, and an action therefor shall immediately accrue.  Such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Principal Office for the account of PNC Bank with respect to the Swing Loans, and for the ratable accounts of the Banks with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans, in U.S. Dollars and in immediately available funds, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute such amounts to the Banks, as applicable, in immediately available funds, that in the event payments are received by 12:00 noon, Columbus, Ohio time, by the Administrative Agent with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans and such payments are not distributed to the Banks on the same day received by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall pay the Banks the Federal Funds Effective Rate with respect to the amount of such payments for each day held by the Administrative Agent and not distributed to the Banks.  The Administrative Agent's and each Bank's statement of account, ledger or other relevant record shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive as the statement of the amount of principal of and interest on the Loans and other amounts owing under this Agreement and shall be deemed an "account stated."

Each borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans shall be allocated to each Bank according to its Ratable Share, and each selection of, conversion to or renewal of any Interest Rate Option applicable to Revolving Credit Loans and each payment or prepayment by the Borrower with respect to principal or interest on the Revolving Credit Loans, Facility Fees, Letter of Credit Fees, or other fees (except for the Administrative Agent's Fee) or amounts due from the Borrower hereunder to the Banks with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans, shall (except as provided in Section 3.4.3 [Administrative Agent's and Bank's Rights] in the case of an event specified in Section 3.4 [Euro-Rate Unascertainable; Etc.], 4.4.2 [Replacement of a Bank] or 4.6 [Additional Compensation in Certain Circumstances]) be made in proportion to the applicable Revolving Credit Loans outstanding from each Bank and, if no such Loans are then outstanding, in proportion to the Ratable Share of each Bank.  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, each borrowing or payment or pre-payment by the Borrower of principal, interest, fees or other amounts from the Borrower with respect to Swing Loans shall be made by or to PNC Bank according to Section 2.
Interest on Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies shall be due and payable in arrears on the first day of each June, September, December and March after the date hereof and on the Expiration Date or upon acceleration of the Notes.  Interest on Loans to which the Euro-Rate Option applies  shall be due and payable on the last day of each Interest Period for such Loans and, if such Interest Period is longer than ninety (90) days, also on the ninetieth (90th) day of such Interest Period and on the Expiration Date or upon the acceleration of the Notes.
The Borrower shall have the right at its option from time to time to prepay the Loans in whole or part without premium or penalty (except as provided in Section 4.4.2 [Replacement of a Bank] below or in Section 4.6 [Additional Compensation in Certain Circumstances]):
(i)             at any time with respect to any Loan to which the Base Rate Option applies,
(ii)            on the last day of the applicable Interest Period with respect to Loans to which a Euro-Rate Option applies, and

(iii)           on the date specified in a notice by any Bank pursuant to Section 3.4 [Euro-Rate Unascertainable, Etc.] with respect to any Loan to which a Euro-Rate Option applies.
Whenever the Borrower desires to prepay any part of the Loans, it shall provide a prepayment notice to the Administrative Agent by 11:00 a.m., Columbus, Ohio time, at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date of prepayment of Revolving Credit Loans or no later than 11:00 a.m., Columbus, Ohio time, on the date of prepayment of Swing Loans, setting forth the following information:
(x)             the date, which shall be a Business Day, on which the proposed prepayment is to be made;
(y)            a statement indicating the application of the prepayment between the Swing Loans and the Revolving Credit Loans; and
(z)            the total principal amount of such prepayment, which (i) with respect to Revolving Credit Loans shall be in integral multiples of One Million and 00/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and not less than Five Million and 00/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00) for each Borrowing Tranche to which the Euro-Rate Option applies and in integral multiples of One Million and 00/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and not less than the lesser of Five Million and 00/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00) or the outstanding principal amount or Revolving Credit Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies and (ii) with respect to Swing Loans, in integral multiples of One Million and 00/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and not less than the lesser of Five Million and 00/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00) or the outstanding principal amount of the Swing Loans.
All prepayment notices shall be irrevocable.  The principal amount of the Loans for which a prepayment notice is given, together with interest on such principal amount except with respect to Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies, shall be due and payable on the date specified in such prepayment notice as the date on which the proposed prepayment is to be made.  Except as provided in Section 3.4.3 [Administrative Agent's and Bank's Rights], if the Borrower prepays a Loan but fails to specify the applicable Borrowing Tranche which the Borrower is prepaying, the prepayment shall be applied first to Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies, then to Loans to which the Euro-Rate Option applies.  Any prepayment hereunder shall be subject to the Borrower's Obligation to indemnify the Banks under Section 4.6.2 [Indemnity].
In the event any Bank (i) gives notice under Section 3.4 [Euro-Rate Unascertainable, Etc.] or Section 4.6.1 [Increased Costs, Etc.], (ii) does not fund Revolving Credit Loans because the making of such Loans would contravene any Law applicable to such Bank, (iii) becomes subject to the control of an Official Body (other than normal and customary supervision), or (iv) has failed to consent to a proposed modification, amendment or waiver which pursuant to the terms of Section 10.1 [Modifications, Amendments or Waivers] or any other provision of any Loan Document requires the consent of all of the Banks and with respect to which the Super-Majority Required Banks shall have granted their consent, then the Borrower shall have the right at its option, if no Event of Default or Potential Default then exists and with the consent of the Administrative Agent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, (a) within sixty (60) days after (x) receipt of such Bank's notice under Section 3.4 [Euro-Rate Unascertainable, Etc.] or 4.6.1 [Increased Costs, Etc.], (y) the date such Bank has failed to fund Revolving Credit Loans because the making of such Loans would contravene Law applicable to such Bank, or (z) the date such Bank became subject to the control of an Official Body, as applicable, or (b) within sixty (60) days after such Bank has failed to consent to a proposed modification, amendment or waiver, to prepay the Loans of such Bank in whole (together with all interest accrued thereon any amounts required under Section 4.6 [Additional Compensation in Certain Circumstances] and any accrued interest due on such amount and any related fees) and terminate such Bank's Commitment or to have such Bank's Commitment replaced by one or more of the remaining Banks or a replacement bank acceptable to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 10.11 [Successors and Assigns] hereof; , that the remaining Banks shall have no obligation hereunder to increase their Commitments; , further to the extent the Borrower elects to replace a Bank which gave the Borrower notice under Section 3.4 [Euro-Rate Unascertainable, etc.] or 4.6.1 [Increased Costs, etc.] or which failed to fund a Revolving Credit Loan because the making of such Loans would contravene any Law applicable to such Bank, it shall be obligated to remove or replace, as the case may be, all Banks that have made similar requests for compensation pursuant to Section 3.4 [Euro-Rate Unascertainable, etc.] or 4.6.1 [Increased Costs, etc.] or Section 4.6.1 [Increased Costs, etc.] or who have failed to fund such Loans.

THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
Each Bank hereby irrevocably designates, appoints and authorizes PNC Bank to act as Administrative Agent for such Bank under this Agreement and to execute and deliver or accept on behalf of each of the Banks the other Loan Documents.  Each Bank hereby irrevocably authorizes, and each holder of any Note by the acceptance of a Note shall be deemed irrevocably to authorize, the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any other instruments and agreements referred to herein, and to exercise such powers and to perform such duties hereunder as are specifically delegated to or required of the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  PNC Bank agrees to act as the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Banks to the extent provided in this Agreement.
The Administrative Agent may perform any of its duties hereunder by or through agents or employees ( such delegation does not constitute a relinquishment of its duties as Administrative Agent and the other requirements set out in Section 9.11 [Banks in Their Individual Capacities] have been fulfilled) subject to Sections 9.5 [Reimbursement of Administrative Agent by Loan Parties, Etc.] and 9.6 [Exculpatory Provisions, Etc.], shall be entitled to engage and pay for the advice or services of any attorneys, accountants or other experts concerning all matters pertaining to its duties hereunder and to rely upon any advice so obtained.
provided
The Administrative Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations, or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or otherwise exist.  The duties of the Administrative Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in nature; the Administrative Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement a fiduciary or trust relationship in respect of any Bank; and nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon the Administrative Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement except as expressly set forth herein.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of the term "agent" in this Agreement with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law.  Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.  Each Bank expressly acknowledges (i) that the Administrative Agent has not made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the Administrative Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of any of the Loan Parties, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Bank; (ii) that it has made and will continue to make, without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, its own independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs and its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of each of the Loan Parties in connection with this Agreement and the making and continuance of the Loans hereunder; and (iii) except as expressly provided herein, that the Administrative Agent shall have no duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Bank with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before the making of any Loan or at any time or times thereafter.
 
- 83 -
 
The Administrative Agent agrees, upon the written request of the Required Banks, to take or refrain from taking any action of the type specified as being within the Administrative Agent's rights, powers or discretion herein, that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action which exposes the Administrative Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or applicable Law.  In the absence of a request by the Required Banks, the Administrative Agent shall have authority, in its sole discretion, to take or not to take any such action, unless this Agreement specifically requires the consent of the Required Banks or all of the Banks.  Any action taken or failure to act pursuant to such instructions or discretion shall be binding on the Banks, subject to Section 9.6 [Exculpatory Provisions, Etc.].

The Administrative Agent shall promptly send to each Bank a copy of all notices received from the Borrower pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents promptly upon receipt thereof.

The Banks and the holders of any participations in any Notes agree among themselves that,with respect to all amounts received by any Bank or any such holder for application on any Obligation hereunder or under any Note or under any such participation, whether received by voluntary payment, by realization upon security, by the exercise of the right of set-off or banker's lien, by counterclaim or by any other non-pro rata source, equitable adjustment will be made in the manner stated in the following sentence so that, in effect, all such excess amounts will be shared ratably among the Banks and such holders in proportion to their interests in payments under the Notes, except as otherwise provided in Section 3.4.3 [Administrative Agent's and Bank's Rights], 4.4.2 [Replacement of a Bank] or 4.6 [Additional Compensation in Certain Circumstances].  The Banks or any such holder receiving any such amount shall purchase for cash from each of the other Banks an interest in such Bank's Loans in such amount as shall result in a ratable participation by the Banks and each such holder in the aggregate unpaid amount under the Notes, that if all or any portion of such excess amount is thereafter recovered from the Bank or the holder making such purchase, such purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, together with interest or other amounts, if any, required by Law (including court order) to be paid by the Bank or the holder making such purchase.

Upon its appointment pursuant to either clause (a) or (b) above, such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor agent,effective upon its appointment, and the former Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement.

The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent a nonreturnable fee (the "Administrative Agent's Fee") for the Administrative Agent's services hereunder under the terms of a letter (the "Administrative Agents Letter") between the Borrower and Administrative Agent, as amended from time to time.
The Administrative Agent may assume that each Bank has made or will make the proceeds of a Loan available to the Administrative Agent unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by such Bank (1) with respect to any Loan to which the Euro-Rate Option applies,  before the close of business on the Business Day preceding the Borrowing Date with respect to such Loan or (2) with respect to any Loan to which the Base Rate Option applies, two (2) hours before the time the Administrative Agent actually funds the proceeds of such Loan to the Borrower (whether using its own funds pursuant to this Section 9.16 or using proceeds deposited with the Administrative Agent by the Banks and whether such funding occurs before or after the time on which Banks are required to deposit the proceeds of such Loan with the Administrative Agent).  The Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption (but shall not be required to), make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Bank, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Bank (or, if such Bank fails to pay such amount forthwith upon such demand from the Borrower) together with interest thereon, in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was made available to the Borrower and ending on the date the Administrative Agent recovers such amount, at a rate per annum equal to (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate during the first three (3) days after such interest shall begin to accrue and (ii) the applicable interest rate in respect of such Loan after the end of such three-day period.
In the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, the Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any error in computing the amount payable to any Bank whether in respect of the Loans, fees or any other amounts due to the Banks under this Agreement.  In the event an error in computing any amount payable to any Bank is made, the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and each affected Bank shall, forthwith upon discovery of such error, make such adjustments as shall be required to correct such error, and any compensation therefor will be calculated at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
Each Bank acknowledges and agrees that neither such Bank, nor any of its Affiliates, participants or assignees, may rely on the Administrative Agent to carry out such Bank's, Affiliate's, participant's or assignee's customer identification program, or other obligations required or imposed under or pursuant to the USA Patriot Act or the regulations thereunder, including the regulations contained in 31 CFR 103.121 (as hereafter amended or replaced, the "CIP Regulations"), or any other Anti-Terrorism Law, including any programs involving any of the following items relating to or in connection with any of the Loan Parties, their Affiliates or their agents, the Loan Documents or the transactions hereunder or contemplated hereby: (1) any identity verification procedures, (2) any record keeping, (3) comparisons with government lists, (4) customer notices or (5) other procedures required under the CIP Regulations or such other Laws.

The Banks will attempt to minimize the fees and expenses of legal counsel for the Banks which are subject to reimbursement by the Borrower hereunder by considering the usage of one law firm to represent the Banks and the Administrative Agent if appropriate under the circumstances.  In addition, the Banks hereby agree not to require that the Loan Parties pay to the Banks an "amendment fee" in connection with any approval or consent that may be provided by them to the Loan Parties pursuant to this Agreement in connection with any amendment to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents required solely as a result of the Loan Parties request to have a Guarantor become a Borrower hereunder (the "Additional Borrower Amendment"); provided, however, that the Loan Parties shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Additional Borrower Amendment as provided for above in this Section 10.3.

Each Bank or assignee or participant of a Bank agrees that it will deliver to each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two (2) duly completed appropriate valid Withholding Certificates (as defined under  1.1441-1(c)(16) of the Income Tax Regulations (the "Regulations")) certifying its status (i.e. U.S. or foreign person) and, if appropriate, making a claim of reduced, or exemption from, U.S. withholding tax on the basis of an income tax treaty or an exemption provided by the Internal Revenue Code.  The term "Withholding Certificate" means a Form W-9; a Form W-8BEN; a Form W-8ECI; a Form W-8IMY and the related statements and certifications as required under  1.1441-1(e)(2) and/or (3) of the Regulations; a statement described in  1.871-14(c)(2)(v) of the Regulations; or any other certificates under the Internal Revenue Code or Regulations that certify or establish the status of a payee or beneficial owner as a U.S. or foreign person.  Each Bank, assignee or participant shall deliver such valid Withholding Certificate as follows:  (A) each Bank which is a party hereto on the Closing Date shall deliver such valid Withholding Certificate at least five (5) Business Days prior to the first date on which any interest or fees are payable by the Borrower hereunder for the account of such Bank; (B) each assignee or participant shall deliver such valid Withholding Certificate at least five (5) Business Days before the effective date of such assignment or participation (unless the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion shall permit such assignee or participant to deliver such valid Withholding Certificate less than five (5) Business Days before such date in which case it shall be due on the date specified by the Administrative Agent).  Each Bank, assignee or participant further undertakes to deliver to each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two (2) additional copies of such Withholding Certificate (or a successor form) on or before the date that such Withholding Certificate expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent Withholding Certificate so delivered by it, and such amendments thereto or extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent.  Notwithstanding the submission of a Withholding Certificate claiming a reduced rate of or exemption from U.S. withholding tax, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to withhold United States federal income taxes at the full thirty percent (30%) withholding rate if in its reasonable judgment it is required to do so under the due diligence requirements imposed upon a withholding agent under  1.1441-7(b) of the Regulations.  Further, the Administrative Agent is indemnified under  1.1461-1(e) of the Regulations against any claims and demands of any Bank or assignee or participant of a Bank for the amount of any tax it deducts and withholds in accordance with regulations under  1441 of the Internal Revenue Code.
Each Bank or assignee or participant of a Bank that is not incorporated under the Laws of the United States of America or a state thereof (and is not excepted from the certification requirement contained in Section 313 of the USA Patriot Act and the applicable regulations because it is both (i) an affiliate of a depository institution or foreign bank that maintains a physical presence in the United States or foreign country, and (ii) subject to supervision by a banking authority regulating such affiliated depository institution or foreign bank) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the certification, or, if applicable, recertification, certifying that such Bank is not a "shell" and certifying to other matters as required by Section 313 of the USA Patriot Act and the applicable regulations: (1) within ten (10) days after the Closing Date, and (2) as such other times as are required under the USA Patriot Act.

Any Subsidiary of the Parent which is required to join this Agreement as a Guarantor pursuant to Section 7.2.8 [Subsidiaries, Partnerships and Joint Ventures, etc.] and which has not yet done so shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent (i) a Guarantor Joinder in substantially the form attached hereto as pursuant to which it shall join as a Guarantor each of the documents to which the Guarantors are parties; and (ii) documents in the forms described in Section 6.1 [First Loans] modified as appropriate to relate to such Subsidiary.  The Loan Parties shall deliver such Guarantor Joinder and related documents to the Administrative Agent within ten (10) Business Days after the date of (a) the filing of such Subsidiary's articles of incorporation if the Subsidiary is a corporation, (b) the filing of its certificate of limited partnership if it is a limited partnership or (c) if it is an entity other than a limited partnership or corporation, its organization.
Exhibit 1.1(G)(1)
Each Bank that is subject to the USA Patriot Act and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Bank) hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information  that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Bank or Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower in accordance with the USA Patriot Act.

For purposes of determining the Applicable Margin, the Applicable Facility Fee Percentage, the Applicable Commercial Letter of Credit Fee Percentage and the Applicable Standby Letter of Credit Fee Percentage:
(a)            The Applicable Margin, the Applicable Facility Fee Percentage, the Applicable Commercial Letter of Credit Fee Percentage and the Applicable Standby Letter of Credit Fee Percentage shall be computed based on the applicable Debt Ratings then in effect.
(b)            If a difference exists in the Debt Ratings of Moody's and Standard & Poor's and the difference is only one level (for example if Moody's is Level III and Standard & Poor's is Level II), the higher of such Debt Ratings (Standard & Poor's in the example in the preceding parenthetical - Level II) will determine the relevant pricing level.
 
 
 
(c)            If a difference exists in the Debt Ratings of Moody's and Standard & Poor's and the difference is two or more levels (for example if Moody's is Level IV and Standard & Poor's is Level II), the lower of such Debt Ratings (Moody's in the example in the preceding parenthetical - Level IV) will determine the relevant pricing level.
(d)            Any increase or decrease in the Applicable Margin, the Applicable Facility Fee Percentage, the Applicable Commercial Letter of Credit Fee Percentage and the Applicable Standby Letter of Credit Fee Percentage shall become effective as of the date on which the applicable rating agency announces its change in the Debt Rating requiring such an increase or decrease.
(e)            If only one rating agency provides a Debt Rating, that Debt Rating is the only applicable Debt Rating.

2.

EXTENT OF GUARANTOR'S LIABILITY
.  The Guarantor's liability hereunder is absolute and unconditional and shall not be reduced, limited, waived, or released in any way by reason of:  (i) any failure of the Administrative Agent or any Bank to obtain, retain, preserve, perfect or enforce any rights against any Person (including without limitation, any Obligor) or in any property securing any or all of the Debtor Liabilities; (ii) the invalidity or irregularity of any such rights that the Administrative Agent and the Banks may attempt to obtain; (iii) any delay in enforcing or any failure to enforce such rights, even if such rights are thereby lost; (iv) any delay in making demand on any Obligor for payment or performance of any or all of the Debtor Liabilities; or (v) from time to time, the payment in full and subsequent incurring of any Debtor Liabilities.
UNCONDITIONAL LIABILITY
 
 
 
.  The Guarantor hereby waives all notice with respect to the present existence or future incurrence of any Debtor Liabilities including, but not limited to, the amount, terms and conditions thereof.  The Guarantor hereby consents to the taking of, or failure to take, from time to time, any action of any nature whatsoever permitted by Law with respect to the Debtor Liabilities and with respect to any rights against any Person or Persons (including, without limitation, any Obligor), or in any property including, without limitation, any renewals, extensions, modifications, postponements, compromises, indulgences, waivers, surrenders, exchanges and releases, and the Guarantor will remain fully liable hereunder notwithstanding any or all of the foregoing.  The granting of an express written release of the Guarantor's liability hereunder or any other Obligor's liability shall be effective only with respect to the liability hereunder of the Guarantor or Obligor who is specifically so expressly released but shall in no way affect the liability hereunder of any other Guarantor or any Obligor not so expressly released.  The dissolution of the Guarantor or any other Obligor shall in no way affect the liability hereunder or that of any other Obligor.  The Guarantor hereby expressly waives:  (i) notices of acceptance hereof; (ii) any presentment, demand, protest, notice of default in connection with the Debtor Liabilities, dishonor or notice of dishonor; (iii) any right of indemnification; and (iv) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense whatsoever to the liability of the Debtor, or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or in discharge of, the Guarantor with respect to its obligations hereunder.
WAIVER
No payment by the Guarantor shall entitle any Obligor, by subrogation, contribution, indemnification or otherwise, to succeed to any of the rights of the Administrative Agent and the Banks, including rights to any payment made on account of the Debtor Liabilities, regardless of the source of such payment, until all of the Debtor's obligations to the Administrative Agent and the Banks under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents are satisfied in full and the Commitments are terminated.  The Guarantor hereby waives any benefit of and any right to participate in any collateral security now or hereafter held by the Administrative Agent and the Banks or any failure or refusal by the Administrative Agent and the Banks to perfect an interest in any collateral security.
.  Neither the Guarantor's obligations to make payment in accordance with the terms of this Agreement nor any remedy for the enforcement hereof shall be impaired, modified, changed, released or limited in any manner whatsoever by the Debtor's bankruptcy or by any impairment, modification, change, release or limitation of (i) the liability of the Debtor, any Person assuming the obligations of the Debtor under the Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or the Debtor's estate in bankruptcy or (ii) any remedy for the enforcement of the Debtor Liabilities, either of which result from the operation of any present or further provision of any bankruptcy act, Law or equitable cause or from the decision of any court.  The Guarantor agrees that to the extent that the Debtor or any other Obligor makes a payment or payments to the Administrative Agent or any Bank, which payment or payments or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be paid to a trustee, receiver or any other Person under any bankruptcy act, Law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such payment, the Debtor Liabilities or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if said payment had not been made.
BANKRUPTCY OF THE DEBTOR
 
 
 
.  In addition to all other liabilities of the Guarantor hereunder, the Guarantor also agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent on demand all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and legal expenses) which may be incurred in the enforcement or collection of the liabilities of the Guarantor hereunder.
PAYMENT OF COSTS
.  The Guarantor agrees that this Agreement may be enforced by the Administrative Agent and the Banks without the necessity at any time of resorting to or exhausting any other security or collateral and without the necessity at any time of having recourse to the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, or any collateral now or hereafter securing the Debtor Liabilities or otherwise, and the Guarantor hereby waives the right to require the Administrative Agent and the Banks to proceed against any other Obligor or to require the Administrative Agent and the Banks to pursue any other remedy or enforce any other right.  The Guarantor further agrees that nothing contained herein shall prevent the Administrative Agent and the Banks from suing on the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, or any of them, or foreclosing their Lien, if any, on any collateral hereafter securing the Debtor Liabilities or from exercising any other rights available under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, or any other instrument of security if neither the Debtor nor the Guarantor timely satisfies the Debtor Liabilities thereunder, and the exercise of any of the aforesaid rights and the completion of any foreclosure proceedings shall not constitute a discharge of any of the obligations of the Guarantor thereunder; it being the purpose and intent of the Guarantor that the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall be absolute, independent and unconditional.  Neither the obligations of the Guarantor under this Agreement nor any remedy for the enforcement thereof shall be impaired, modified, changed or released in any manner whatsoever by an impairment, modification, change, release or limitation of the liability of the Debtor or by reason of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Debtor.  If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by the Debtor is stayed upon the insolvency or bankruptcy of the Debtor, amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents including, without limitation, interest at the rates set forth in the Credit Agreement occurring after the date of such bankruptcy or insolvency, shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantor hereunder forthwith on demand by the Administrative Agent.  The Guarantor acknowledges that the term "Debtor Liabilities" as used herein includes any payments made by the Debtor to the Administrative Agent or the Banks and subsequently recovered by the Debtor or a trustee for the Debtor pursuant to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings.
PRIMARY LIABILITY OF THE GUARANTOR
.  Upon the occurrence of any of the following events, all of the Debtor Liabilities, at the Administrative Agent's and the Banks' option, shall be deemed to be forthwith due and payable for the purposes of this Agreement and for determining the liability of the Guarantor hereunder, whether or not the Administrative Agent and the Banks have any such rights against any other Obligor, and whether or not the Administrative Agent and the Banks elect to exercise any rights or remedies against any other Person or property including, without limitation, any other Obligor:  (i) the failure of the Guarantor to perform any covenant or obligation hereunder; (ii) the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement which has not been cured; (iii) except as otherwise permitted pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the sale of all or substantially all of the assets, or change in ownership, or the dissolution, merger, consolidation or reorganization of the Guarantor, (iv) any information or signature heretofore or hereafter furnished to the Administrative Agent or any Bank by the Guarantor, or delivered to the Administrative Agent or any Bank by an Obligor in connection with any of the Debtor Liabilities, is materially false or incorrect at the time when made; or (v) the failure of the Guarantor or any Obligor to furnish the Administrative Agent and the Banks such financial and other information as required by the Loan Documents.
ACCELERATION OF THE GUARANTOR'S LIABILITIES
 
 
 
.  All rights and remedies of the Guarantor against the Debtor or any property of the Debtor or any collateral security for any of the Debtor Liabilities, whether arising by promissory note, subrogation, security agreement, mortgage or otherwise, shall in all respects be and remain subordinate and junior in right of payment and priority to the prior and indefeasible payment in full to the Administrative Agent and the Banks of all Debtor Liabilities and to the priority of the Administrative Agent and the Banks in any property of the Debtor and any collateral security for any of the Debtor Liabilities.  Any amount which may have been paid to the Guarantor on account of any indebtedness of the Debtor to the Guarantor, or on account of any subrogation or other rights of the Guarantor against the Debtor, when all of the Debtor Liabilities shall not have been indefeasibly paid in full, shall be held by the undersigned in trust for the benefit of the Banks and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited and applied upon the Debtor Liabilities, whether matured or unmatured.
RIGHTS OF THE GUARANTOR
.  Any notice to the Administrative Agent or the Banks by the Guarantor pursuant to the provisions hereof shall be sent, and shall be effective, in accordance with Section 10.6 of the Credit Agreement, to:
NOTICE TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE BANKS BY THE GUARANTOR
Notice by the Guarantor shall not, in any way, reduce, diminish or release the liability of any other Obligor.  In the event that this Agreement is preceded or followed by any other guaranty or surety agreement(s) regarding the Debtor or any other Person, all rights granted to the Administrative Agent and the Banks in such agreement(s) shall be deemed to be cumulative and this Agreement shall not, in such event, be deemed to be cancelled, superseded, terminated or in any way limited.
.  This Agreement shall be binding upon the Guarantor and the Guarantor' successors, assigns and other legal representatives, and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Banks, their respective endorsers, successors and assigns forever.  If any provision of this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof, but this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein.  All matters arising hereunder shall be governed by the Laws of the State of Ohio without regard to the conflicts of laws thereof, and the parties hereto agree to the jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, Ohio and the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio with respect to any suit arising in connection herewith.
MISCELLANEOUS
 
 
 
.  THE UNDERSIGNED HEREBY EXPRESSLY, KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ALL BENEFIT AND ADVANTAGE OF ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY, AND IT WILL NOT AT ANY TIME INSIST UPON, OR PLEAD OR IN ANY MANNER WHATSOEVER CLAIM OR TAKE THE BENEFIT OR ADVANTAGE OF A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS.

CONTINUING GUARANTORS
Bankruptcy of the Debtor
.  This Agreement shall be and is intended to be an absolute and unconditional guaranty and suretyship for the aggregate of the Debtor Liabilities; provided, however, that the Guarantors' total liability hereunder shall be limited as set forth below.  The obligations of the Guarantors under this Agreement, when construed collectively with the obligations of (i) Big Lots, Inc., an Ohio corporation (the "Parent Guarantor") under that certain Guaranty and Suretyship Agreement, dated of even date herewith, made by the Parent Guarantor for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Banks, and (ii) any other Person that becomes a Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, are intended to be the joint and several obligations of the Guarantors, the Parent Guarantor and such other Persons that become Guarantors under the Credit Agreement, and this Agreement, when construed in connection with such other Guaranty and Suretyship Agreements, is intended to be an absolute and unconditional guaranty and suretyship for the aggregate of the Debtor Liabilities.
EXTENT OF GUARANTORS' LIABILITY
Subject to the remainder of this paragraph, but otherwise notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the maximum liability of each Guarantor under this Agreement shall not exceed the sum of (i) that portion of the Debtor Liabilities, the proceeds of which are used by the Debtor to make Valuable Transfers (as hereinafter defined) to such Guarantor, plus (ii) ninety-five percent (95%) of the Adjusted Net Worth (as hereinafter defined), but only to the extent that Adjusted Net Worth is a positive number, of such Guarantor at the date of this Agreement.  For purposes of this paragraph:
 
 
 
"Adjusted Net Worth" shall mean, as of any date of determination thereof, the excess of (i) the amount of the fair saleable value of the assets of such Guarantor as of the date of such determination, determined in accordance with applicable federal and state Laws governing determinations of insolvency of debtors, over (ii) the amount of all liabilities of such Guarantor, contingent or otherwise, as of the date of such determination, determined on the basis provided in the preceding clause (i), in all events prior to giving effect to Valuable Transfers.
"Valuable Transfers" shall mean (a) all loans, advances, other credit accommodations, or capital contributions made to such Guarantor with proceeds of the Loans, (b) the amount of Letters of Credit Outstanding with respect to Letters of Credit issued to support the obligations or Indebtedness of such Guarantor, (c) all debt securities or other obligations or Indebtedness of such Guarantor acquired from such Guarantor or retired, redeemed, purchased or acquired by such Guarantor with proceeds of any Loans or any Letters of Credit issued to support the obligations or indebtedness of such Guarantor, (d) all equity securities of such Guarantor acquired from such Guarantor with the proceeds of any Loans or of any drawings on Letters of Credit issued to support the obligations of such Guarantor, (e) the fair market value of all property acquired with proceeds of the Loans or of any drawings on Letters of Credit issued to support the obligations or Indebtedness of such Guarantor and transferred to such Guarantor, (f) the interest on and the fees in respect of the Loans, the proceeds of which are used to make such a Valuable Transfer, and (g) the value of any quantifiable economic benefits not included in clauses (a) through (f) above, but includable in accordance with applicable federal and state Laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, accruing to such Guarantor as a result of the Loans or the Letters of Credit Outstanding.
The Guarantors agree that the Debtor Liabilities may at any time and from time to time exceed the maximum liability of the Guarantors hereunder without impairing this Agreement or affecting the rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Banks hereunder.  No payment or payments made by the Debtor, the Guarantors, the Parent Guarantor or any other Person or received or collected by the Administrative Agent or any Bank from the Debtor, the Parent Guarantor or any other Person by virtue of any action or proceeding or any set-off or appropriation or application at any time or from time to time in reduction of or in payment of the Debtor Liabilities shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability of the Guarantors under this Agreement and the Guarantors shall, notwithstanding any such payment or payments (other than payments made to the Administrative Agent or any Bank by the Guarantors or payments received or collected by the Administrative Agent or any Bank from the Guarantors), remain liable for the Debtor Liabilities up to the maximum liability amount of the Guarantors set forth in this paragraph until the Debtor Liabilities are indefeasibly paid in full in cash, each Bank's obligation to make Loans is terminated according to the terms of the Credit Agreement, all Letters of Credit have either expired or have been cancelled and all Hedge Agreements with respect to any Bank-Provided Hedge have either expired or have been terminated; provided, however, that, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Guarantors' liability under this paragraph exceed the maximum amount that, after giving effect to the incurring of the obligations hereunder and to any rights to contribution of the Guarantors from the Debtor and other affiliates of the Debtor, would not render the Administrative Agent's and the Banks' right to payment hereunder void, voidable or avoidable under any applicable fraudulent transfer law; and further provided that if a greater amount of the Debtor Liabilities than the maximum liability set forth in this paragraph could be repaid by the Guarantors as a result of an increase in any Guarantor's Adjusted Net Worth subsequent to the date of this Agreement, without rendering the Administrative Agent's and the Banks' right to payment hereunder void, voidable or avoidable under any applicable fraudulent transfer law, then the amount of such Guarantor's maximum liability calculated in the first sentence of this paragraph shall be calculated based upon such Guarantor's Adjusted Net Worth on such later date, rather than the date of execution of this Agreement.
 
 
 
.  The Guarantors' liability hereunder is absolute and unconditional and shall not be reduced, limited, waived, or released in any way by reason of:  (i) any failure of the Administrative Agent or any Bank to obtain, retain, preserve, perfect or enforce any rights against any Person (including without limitation, any Obligor) or in any property securing any or all of the Debtor Liabilities; (ii) the invalidity or irregularity of any such rights that the Administrative Agent and the Banks may attempt to obtain; (iii) any delay in enforcing or any failure to enforce such rights, even if such rights are thereby lost; (iv) any delay in making demand on any Obligor for payment or performance of any or all of the Debtor Liabilities; or (v) from time to time, the payment in full and subsequent incurring of any Debtor Liabilities.
UNCONDITIONAL LIABILITY
.  The Guarantors hereby waive all notice with respect to the present existence or future incurrence of any Debtor Liabilities including, but not limited to, the amount, terms and conditions thereof.  The Guarantors hereby consent to the taking of, or failure to take, from time to time, any action of any nature whatsoever permitted by Law with respect to the Debtor Liabilities and with respect to any rights against any Person or Persons (including, without limitation, any Obligor), or in any property including, without limitation, any renewals, extensions, modifications, postponements, compromises, indulgences, waivers, surrenders, exchanges and releases, and the Guarantors will remain fully liable hereunder notwithstanding any or all of the foregoing.  The granting of an express written release of any Guarantor's liability hereunder or any other Obligor's liability shall be effective only with respect to the liability hereunder of such Guarantor or Obligor who is specifically so expressly released but shall in no way affect the liability hereunder of any other Guarantor or any Obligor not so expressly released.  The dissolution of any Guarantor or any other Obligor shall in no way affect the liability hereunder or that of any other Obligor.  Each Guarantor hereby expressly waives:  (i) notices of acceptance hereof; (ii) any presentment, demand, protest, notice of default in connection with the Debtor Liabilities, dishonor or notice of dishonor; (iii) any right of indemnification; and (iv) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense whatsoever to the liability of the Debtor, or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or in discharge of, such Guarantor with respect to its obligations hereunder.
WAIVER
No payment by any Guarantor shall entitle any Obligor, by subrogation, contribution, indemnification or otherwise, to succeed to any of the rights of the Administrative Agent and the Banks, including rights to any payment made on account of the Debtor Liabilities, regardless of the source of such payment, until all of the Debtor's obligations to the Administrative Agent and the Banks under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents are satisfied in full and the Commitments are terminated.  The Guarantors hereby waive any benefit of and any right to participate in any collateral security now or hereafter held by the Administrative Agent and the Banks or any failure or refusal by the Administrative Agent and the Banks to perfect an interest in any collateral security.
 
 
 
.  Neither the Guarantors' obligations to make payment in accordance with the terms of this Agreement nor any remedy for the enforcement hereof shall be impaired, modified, changed, released or limited in any manner whatsoever by the Debtor's bankruptcy or by any impairment, modification, change, release or limitation of (i) the liability of the Debtor, any Person assuming the obligations of the Debtor under the Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or the Debtor's estate in bankruptcy or (ii) any remedy for the enforcement of the Debtor Liabilities, either of which result from the operation of any present or further provision of any bankruptcy act, Law or equitable cause or from the decision of any court.  The Guarantors agree that to the extent that the Debtor or any other Obligor makes a payment or payments to the Administrative Agent or any Bank, which payment or payments or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be paid to a trustee, receiver or any other Person under any bankruptcy act, Law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such payment, the Debtor Liabilities or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if said payment had not been made.
BANKRUPTCY OF THE DEBTOR
.  In addition to all other liabilities of the Guarantors hereunder, the Guarantors also agree to pay to the Administrative Agent on demand all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and legal expenses) which may be incurred in the enforcement or collection of the liabilities of the Guarantors hereunder.
PAYMENT OF COSTS
.  The Guarantors agree that this Agreement may be enforced by the Administrative Agent and the Banks without the necessity at any time of resorting to or exhausting any other security or collateral and without the necessity at any time of having recourse to the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, or any collateral now or hereafter securing the Debtor Liabilities or otherwise, and the Guarantors hereby waive the right to require the Administrative Agent and the Banks to proceed against any other Obligor or to require the Administrative Agent and the Banks to pursue any other remedy or enforce any other right.  The Guarantors further agree that nothing contained herein shall prevent the Administrative Agent and the Banks from suing on the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, or any of them, or foreclosing their Lien, if any, on any collateral hereafter securing the Debtor Liabilities or from exercising any other rights available under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, or any other instrument of security if neither the Debtor nor the Guarantors timely satisfy the Debtor Liabilities thereunder, and the exercise of any of the aforesaid rights and the completion of any foreclosure proceedings shall not constitute a discharge of any of the obligations of the Guarantors thereunder; it being the purpose and intent of the Guarantors that the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute, independent and unconditional.  Neither the obligations of the Guarantors under this Agreement nor any remedy for the enforcement thereof shall be impaired, modified, changed or released in any manner whatsoever by an impairment, modification, change, release or limitation of the liability of the Debtor or by reason of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Debtor.  If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by the Debtor is stayed upon the insolvency or bankruptcy of the Debtor, amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents including, without limitation, interest at the rates set forth in the Credit Agreement occurring after the date of such bankruptcy or insolvency, shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantors hereunder forthwith on demand by the Administrative Agent.  The Guarantors acknowledge that the term "Debtor Liabilities" as used herein includes any payments made by the Debtor to the Administrative Agent or the Banks and subsequently recovered by the Debtor or a trustee for the Debtor pursuant to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings.
PRIMARY LIABILITY OF THE GUARANTORS
 
 
 
.  Upon the occurrence of any of the following events, all of the Debtor Liabilities, at the Administrative Agent's and the Banks' option, shall be deemed to be forthwith due and payable for the purposes of this Agreement and for determining the liability of the Guarantors hereunder, whether or not the Administrative Agent and the Banks have any such rights against any other Obligor, and whether or not the Administrative Agent and the Banks elect to exercise any rights or remedies against any other Person or property including, without limitation, any other Obligor:  (i) the failure of any Guarantor to perform any covenant or obligation hereunder; (ii) the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement which has not been cured; (iii) except as otherwise permitted pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the sale of all or substantially all of the assets, or change in ownership, or the dissolution, merger, consolidation or reorganization of any Guarantor; (iv) any information or signature heretofore or hereafter furnished to the Administrative Agent or any Bank by any Guarantor, or delivered to the Administrative Agent or any Bank by an Obligor in connection with any of the Debtor Liabilities, is materially false or incorrect at the time when made; or (v) the failure of any Guarantor or any Obligor to furnish the Administrative Agent and the Banks such financial and other information as required by the Loan Documents.
ACCELERATION OF THE GUARANTORS' LIABILITIES
.  All rights and remedies of the Guarantors against the Debtor or any property of the Debtor or any collateral security for any of the Debtor Liabilities, whether arising by promissory note, subrogation, security agreement, mortgage or otherwise, shall in all respects be and remain subordinate and junior in right of payment and priority to the prior and indefeasible payment in full to the Administrative Agent and the Banks of all Debtor Liabilities and to the priority of the Administrative Agent and the Banks in any property of the Debtor and any collateral security for any of the Debtor Liabilities.  Any amount which may have been paid to the Guarantors on account of any indebtedness of the Debtor to the Guarantors, or on account of any subrogation or other rights of the Guarantors against the Debtor, when all of the Debtor Liabilities shall not have been indefeasibly paid in full, shall be held by the undersigned in trust for the benefit of the Banks and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited and applied upon the Debtor Liabilities, whether matured or unmatured.
RIGHTS OF THE GUARANTORS
.  Any notice to the Administrative Agent or the Banks by the Guarantors pursuant to the provisions hereof shall be sent, and shall be effective, in accordance with Section 10.6 of the Credit Agreement, to:
NOTICE TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE BANKS BY THE GUARANTORS
 
 
 
 
Notice by a Guarantor shall not, in any way, reduce, diminish or release the liability of any other Obligor.  In the event that this Agreement is preceded or followed by any other guaranty or surety agreement(s) regarding the Debtor or any other Person, all rights granted to the Administrative Agent and the Banks in such agreement(s) shall be deemed to be cumulative and this Agreement shall not, in such event, be deemed to be cancelled, superseded, terminated or in any way limited.
.  This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterpart copies and by the parties hereto on separate counterparts, but all such copies shall constitute one and the same instrument.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of signature page to this Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart.  Any party so executing this Agreement by facsimile transmission shall promptly deliver a manually executed counterpart, provided that any failure to do so shall not affect the validity of the counterpart executed by facsimile transmission.
COUNTERPARTS
.  This Agreement shall be binding upon the Guarantors and the Guarantors' successors, assigns and other legal representatives, and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Banks, their respective endorsers, successors and assigns forever.  If any provision of this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof, but this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein.  All matters arising hereunder shall be governed by the Laws of the State of Ohio without regard to the conflicts of laws thereof, and the parties hereto agree to the jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, Ohio and the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio with respect to any suit arising in connection herewith.
MISCELLANEOUS
.  THE UNDERSIGNED HEREBY EXPRESSLY, KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE ALL BENEFIT AND ADVANTAGE OF ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY, AND THEY WILL NOT AT ANY TIME INSIST UPON, OR PLEAD OR IN ANY MANNER WHATSOEVER CLAIM OR TAKE THE BENEFIT OR ADVANTAGE OF A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS.
WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY
 
 
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned Guarantors, intending to be legally bound, have executed and delivered this Agreement on the day and year first above written.
 
 
 
THIS INTERCOMPANY SUBORDINATION AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is dated April 28, 2009 and is made by and among the entities listed on the signature page hereto (or subsequently joining this Agreement) (each being individually referred to herein as a "Loan Party" and collectively as the "Loan Parties") for the benefit of PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (in such capacity, the "Administrative Agent"), for the Banks (as hereinafter defined).
WHEREAS, each capitalized term used herein shall, unless otherwise defined herein, have the meaning specified in the Credit Agreement, dated of even date herewith (as may be amended, modified, restated or supplemented from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"), by and among Big Lots Stores, Inc., an Ohio corporation (the "Borrower"), the Guarantors party thereto, the Banks party thereto (the "Banks"), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as syndication agent for the Banksthe Administrative Agent; and
, and
WHEREAS, pursuant to the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the Banks intend to make Loans to the Borrower; and
WHEREAS, the Loan Parties other than the Borrower are guarantors of the obligations of the Borrower under the Credit Agreement pursuant to the Guaranty Agreements dated of even date herewith; and
WHEREAS, the Loan Parties are or may become indebted to each other (the Indebtedness of each of the Loan Parties to any other Loan Party, now existing or hereafter incurred (whether created directly or acquired by assignment or otherwise), and interest and premiums, if any, thereon and other amounts payable in respect thereof are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Intercompany Indebtedness") and are permitted to dissolve or merge in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement; and
WHEREAS, the obligations of the Banks to maintain the Commitments and make Loans to the Borrower from time to time are subject to the condition, among others, that the Loan Parties subordinate the Intercompany Indebtedness to the Indebtedness and all other Obligations of the Borrower or any other Loan Party to the Administrative Agent or the Banks pursuant to the Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents (collectively, the "Senior Debt") in the manner set forth herein.
NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto covenant and agree as follows:
.  The recitals set forth above are hereby incorporated by reference.  All Intercompany Indebtedness shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full of all Senior Debt pursuant to the provisions contained herein.
1.             
Intercompany Indebtedness Subordinated to Senior Debt
 
 
 
.  Upon any distribution of assets of any Loan Party in connection with (a) any insolvency or bankruptcy case or proceeding, or any receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar case or proceeding in connection therewith, relative to any such Loan Party or to its creditors, as such, or to its assets, or (b) any assignment for the benefit of creditors or any marshalling of assets and liabilities of any such Loan Party (a Loan Party distributing assets as set forth herein being referred to in such capacity as a "Distributing Loan Party"), then and in any such event, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to receive, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Banks as their respective interests may appear, indefeasible payment in full of all amounts due or to become due, if an Event of Default has occurred under the terms of the Loan Documents or the Senior Debt has been declared due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise have become due and payable, other than pursuant to Section 4.5.2 of the Credit Agreement (each, a "Triggering Event"), on or in respect of any and all Senior Debt before the holder of any Intercompany Indebtedness owed by the Distributing Loan Party is entitled to receive any payment on account of the principal of or interest on such Intercompany Indebtedness, and to that end, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to receive, for application to the payment of the Senior Debt, any payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, which may be payable or deliverable in respect of the Intercompany Indebtedness owed by the Distributing Loan Party in any such case, proceeding, dissolution, liquidation or other winding up event.
2.             
Payment Over of Proceeds Upon Bankruptcy, Etc
If, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, after the occurrence of a Triggering Event, a Loan Party which is owed Intercompany Indebtedness by a Distributing Loan Party shall have received any payment or distribution of assets from the Distributing Loan Party of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, then and in such event such payment or distribution shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Banks as their respective interests may appear, shall be segregated from other funds and property held by such Loan Party, and shall be forthwith paid over to the Administrative Agent in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement) to be applied (in the case of cash) to or held as collateral (in the case of noncash property or securities) for the payment or prepayment of the Senior Debt in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
.  Each Loan Party agrees that, so long as the Senior Debt shall remain unpaid, it will not commence, or join with any creditor other than the Banks and the Administrative Agent in commencing any proceeding referred to in the first paragraph of Section 2 against any other Loan Party which owes it any Intercompany Indebtedness.
3.             
No Commencement of Any Proceeding
.  If a Triggering Event shall have occurred and be continuing, or would result from or exist after giving effect to a payment with respect to any portion of the Intercompany Indebtedness, unless the Required Banks shall have consented to or waived the same, so long as any of the Senior Debt shall remain outstanding, no payment shall be made by any Loan Party owing such Intercompany Indebtedness on account of principal or interest on any portion of the Intercompany Indebtedness except to the extent that the proceeds of such payment are used by the Loan Party receiving such proceeds to immediately apply the same to the Senior Debt.
4.             
No Payment When Senior Debt in Default
 
 
 
If, notwithstanding the foregoing, any Loan Party shall make any payment of the Intercompany Indebtedness to another Loan Party prohibited by the foregoing provisions of this Section, such payment shall be paid over and delivered forthwith to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Banks as their respective interests may appear.
.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent any of the Loan Parties, at any time except during the pendency of any of the conditions described in Sections 2 and 4 hereof, from making payments at any time of principal of or interest on any portion of the Intercompany Indebtedness, or the retention thereof by any of the Loan Parties of any money deposited with them for the payment of or on account of the principal of or interest on the Intercompany Indebtedness.
5.             
Payment Permitted if No Default
.  Each Loan Party agrees that no payment or distribution to the Administrative Agent or the Banks pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement shall entitle it to exercise any rights of subrogation in respect thereof until the Senior Debt shall have been indefeasibly paid in full, the Commitments shall have terminated and all Letters of Credit have expired, have been cancelled or have been rolled into a new credit facility.
6.             
Rights of Subrogation
.  Each Loan Party shall cause each instrument, if any, which now or hereafter evidences all or a portion of the Intercompany Indebtedness to be conspicuously marked as follows:
7.             
Instruments Evidencing Intercompany Indebtedness
"This instrument is subject to the terms of an Intercompany Subordination Agreement dated April 28, 2009 in favor of PNC Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent for the Banks referred to therein, which Intercompany Subordination Agreement is incorporated herein by reference.  Notwithstanding any contrary statement contained in the within instrument, no payment on account of the principal thereof or interest thereon shall become due or payable except in accordance with the express terms of said Intercompany Subordination Agreement."
.  The purpose of this Agreement is solely to define the relative rights of the Loan Parties, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the Banks, on the other hand.  Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to or shall impair, as between any of the Loan Parties and their creditors other than the Administrative Agent and the Banks, the obligation of the Loan Parties to each other to pay the principal of and interest on the Intercompany Indebtedness as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with its terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights among the Loan Parties and their creditors other than the Administrative Agent and the Banks, nor shall anything herein prevent any of the Loan Parties from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable Law upon default under any agreement pursuant to which the Intercompany Indebtedness is created, subject to the rights, if any, under this Agreement of the Administrative Agent and the Banks to receive cash, property or securities otherwise payable or deliverable with respect to the Intercompany Indebtedness.
8.             
Agreement Solely to Define Relative Rights
 
 
 
.  No right of the Administrative Agent or any Bank to enforce subordination, as herein provided, shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of any Loan Party or by any act or failure to act by the Administrative Agent or any Bank, or by any non-compliance by any Loan Party with the terms, provisions and covenants of any agreement pursuant to which the Intercompany Indebtedness is created, regardless of any knowledge thereof the Administrative Agent or any Bank may have or be otherwise charged with.  Each Loan Party by its acceptance hereof shall agree that, so long as there is Senior Debt outstanding or Commitments in effect under the Credit Agreement, such Loan Party shall not agree to sell, assign, pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of, or to compromise, the obligations of the other Loan Parties with respect to their Intercompany Indebtedness, other than by means of payment of such Intercompany Indebtedness according to its terms or the sale, assignment, pledge or transfer to another Loan Party, without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.
9.             
No Implied Waivers of Subordination
Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, to the extent, if any, permitted by the Credit Agreement, the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Loan Parties except the Borrower to the extent provided in the Credit Agreement, without incurring responsibility to the Loan Parties and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Agreement or the obligations hereunder of the Loan Parties to the Administrative Agent and the Banks, do any one or more of the following: (i) change the manner, place or terms of payment, or extend the time of payment, renew or alter the Senior Debt or otherwise amend or supplement the Senior Debt or the Loan Documents; (ii) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing the Senior Debt, if any; (iii) release any Person liable in any manner for the payment or collection of the Senior Debt; and (iv) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against any of the Loan Parties and any other Person.
.  The Loan Parties covenant and agree that they shall cause Subsidiaries created or acquired after the date of this Agreement that are required to join this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.2.8(iv) of the Credit Agreement, to execute a joinder in the form of Exhibit 1.1(G)(1) to the Credit Agreement, whereby such Subsidiary joins this Agreement and subordinates all Indebtedness owed to any such Subsidiary by any of the Loan Parties or other Subsidiaries hereafter created or acquired to the Senior Debt.
10.

Commenting on todays announcement, Steve Fishman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, Our strong financial performance and consistent execution of our strategy have resulted in a business model and credit profile that was very attractive to our lenders.  We are pleased to have received such a strong vote of confidence by our bank group, despite todays highly volatile credit market.
 
Jared Poff, Vice President and Treasurer of Big Lots stated, We recognize and appreciate the support demonstrated by this bank group and their level of commitment which in total exceeded well over $500 million.
