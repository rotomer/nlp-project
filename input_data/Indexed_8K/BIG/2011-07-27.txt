On July 22, 2011, Big Lots, Inc. (BLI), its wholly-owned subsidiaries Big Lots Stores, Inc. (BLSI) and Big Lots Canada, Inc. (BLCI), and certain of its other direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries (together with BLI, BLSI and BLCI, we, us or our) entered into a new $700 million five-year unsecured credit facility (2011 Credit Agreement).  The 2011 Credit Agreement replaces the $500 million three-year unsecured credit facility we entered into on April 28, 2009 (2009 Credit Agreement).
The 2009 Credit Agreement was entered into by and among BLSI, as borrower; BLI and certain other subsidiaries named therein, as guarantors; the Banks named therein; PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the Banks; Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as syndication agent for the Banks; and U.S. Bank National Association, Branch Banking and Trust Company, Compass Bank and The Huntington National Bank, each as a documentation agent for the Banks.  The 2009 Credit Agreement was scheduled to expire on April 28, 2012, but was terminated concurrent with our entry into the 2011 Credit Agreement.  We did not incur any material early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the 2009 Credit Agreement.
The 2011 Credit Agreement was entered into by and among BLI, BLSI and BLCI, as borrowers; BLI (as to BLCIs obligations) and certain subsidiaries named therein (as to BLI and BLSIs obligations), as guarantors; the Banks named therein; PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the Banks; PNC Bank Canada Branch, as Canadian agent for certain Banks; Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and U.S. Bank National Association, as joint syndication agents and joint lead arrangers for the Banks; PNC Capital Markets LLC, as a joint lead arranger for the Banks and the sole bookrunner; and Branch Banking and Trust Company, Compass Bank and The Huntington National Bank, as co-documentation agents for the Banks.  The 2011 Credit Agreement expires on July 22, 2016.  The proceeds of the 2011 Credit Agreement are available for general corporate purposes, working capital and to repay certain of our indebtedness, including amounts due under the 2009 Credit Agreement.  The 2011 Credit Agreement includes a $10 million Canadian swing loan sublimit for BLCI, a $30 million US swing loan sublimit for BLI and BLSI, an aggregate $150 million letter of credit sublimit, and a $200 million Canadian revolving credit loan subfacility for BLCI.  The Canadian swing loan sublimit and revolving credit loan subfacility for BLCI are designed to support the growth of our newly acquired Canadian operations.
The interest rates, pricing and fees under the 2011 Credit Agreement fluctuate based on BLIs debt rating.  Loans made under the 2011 Credit Agreement may be prepaid.  The 2011 Credit Agreement contains financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on indebtedness, liens and investments, as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios  a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio.  A violation of these covenants could result in a default under the 2011 Credit Agreement which would permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access the 2011 Credit Agreement for loans and letters of credit and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans under the 2011 Credit Agreement.  As of July 22, 2011, we had total indebtedness of $130.3 million under the 2011 Credit Agreement, including $74.9 million in letters of credit.  Certain of the lenders who are a party to the 2011 Credit Agreement provide us with commercial banking, trustee and custodial services.
In order for us to make investments in Big Lots Capital, Inc. (Capital), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of BLSI but is not a guarantor to the 2011 Credit Agreement, the 2011 Credit Agreement requires that BLI, BLSI or another subsidiary guarantor take a security interest in substantially all of the personal property of Capital.  Because this same requirement existed under the 2009 Credit Agreement and its predecessor credit facility, we previously satisfied, and continue to satisfy, this obligation through the Security Agreement entered into by and between BLSI and Capital on October 29, 2004.
A copy of the 2011 Credit Agreement is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1.  The foregoing description of the 2011 Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2011 Credit Agreement which is incorporated herein by reference.  The Security Agreement between BLSI and Capital is incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit 10.2 hereof.

The agreements contain representations warranties and covenants by the parties the agreements, and those representations warranties and covenants:

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the US Borrowing Agent by a US Bank or the US Issuing Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a US Bank or the US Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

Notwithstanding the submission of such documentation claiming a reduced rate of or exemption from U.S. withholding tax, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to withhold United States federal income taxes at the full 30% withholding rate if in its reasonable judgment it is required to do so under the due diligence requirements imposed upon a withholding agent under  1.1441-7(b) of the United States Income Tax Regulations.

In addition, any US Bank, if requested by the US Borrowing Agent or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the US Borrowing Agent or the Administrative Agent as will enable the US Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such US Bank is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that any US Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States of America, any Foreign Bank shall deliver to the US Borrowing Agent and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Bank becomes a US Bank under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the US Borrowing Agent or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Bank is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:

(v)          to the extent that any Bank is not a Foreign Bank, such Bank shall submit to the Administrative Agent two (2) originals of an Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or any other form prescribed by applicable Law demonstrating that such Bank is not a Foreign Bank.
Without limiting the generality of the first paragraph of this Section 4.9.5 [Status of Banks] and in addition to any requirements described in the second paragraph of this Section 4.9.5 [Status of Banks], if a payment made to a Bank or an Issuing Bank hereunder or under any other Loan Document would be subject to US federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Bank or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable, or in any agreement or request entered into or issued pursuant to such sections), such Foreign Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall deliver to the US Borrowing Agent and to the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the US Borrowing Agent or the Administrative Agent, such documentation, certifications or other information prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation, certifications or other information reasonably requested by the US Borrowing Agent or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Loan Parties or the Administrative Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, has complied with its obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  In the event that either (i) the documentation required to be delivered pursuant to this paragraph fails to establish a complete exemption from withholding of amounts under Section 1471 and 1472 of the Internal Revenue Code, or (ii) no such required documentation is delivered, the US Borrowers shall not be obligated to pay any additional amounts to any Bank pursuant to Section 4.9.1, or to indemnify any Bank pursuant to Section 4.9.3, in respect of any such withholding imposed under Sections 1471 or 1472 of the Internal Revenue Code.
 
In addition to the compensation or payments required by Section 4.8 [Increased Costs] or Section 4.9 [Taxes], the US Borrowers shall indemnify each US Bank and the Canadian Borrower shall indemnify each Canadian Bank against all liabilities, losses or expenses (including loss of anticipated profits, any foreign exchange losses and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain a Loan, from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract) which such Bank sustains or incurs as a consequence of any:
(i)           payment, prepayment, conversion or renewal of any Loan to which a LIBOR Rate Option or a CDOR Rate Option applies on a day other than the last day of the corresponding LIBOR Interest Period or CDOR Interest Period, as applicable (whether or not such payment or prepayment is mandatory, voluntary or automatic and whether or not such payment or prepayment is then due),
 
- 100 -
 
(ii)          attempt by any US Borrower or the Canadian Borrower to revoke (expressly, by later inconsistent notices or otherwise) in whole or part any Loan Requests under Section 2.4 [US Loan Requests; Canadian Loan Requests; US Swing Loan Requests; Canadian Swing Loan Requests] or Section 3.2 [Interest Periods] or notice relating to prepayments under Section 4.6 [Voluntary Prepayments], or
(iii)         default by the Borrowers in the performance or observance of any covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, including any failure of the Borrowers to pay when due (by acceleration or otherwise) any principal, interest, Facility Fee or any other amount due hereunder.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the US Borrowers hereby acknowledges and agrees that any and all actions, inactions or omissions by any one or more, or all, of the US Borrowers in connection with, related to or otherwise affecting this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents are the obligations of, and inure to and are binding upon, each and all of the US Borrowers, jointly and severally.
 
Each US Borrower hereby irrevocably designates the US Borrowing Agent to be its attorney and agent and in such capacity to borrow, sign and endorse notes, and execute and deliver all instruments, documents, writings and further assurances now or hereafter required hereunder, on behalf of such US Borrower or US Borrowers, and hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent, the US Banks and the US Issuing Bank to pay over or credit all loan proceeds hereunder in accordance with the request of the US Borrowing Agent.

Each US Borrower hereby irrevocably agrees that following the occurrence of any Event of Default which has not been waived by the Administrative Agent or the US Banks, such US Borrower shall not enforce any rights of contribution, indemnity or reimbursement from any other US Borrower on account of such US Borrower's payment of the US Obligations, or any portion thereof, unless and until Payment in Full.  Each of the US Borrowers hereby waives any defenses based on suretyship or impairment of Collateral or the like.

(b)           If a difference exists in the Debt Ratings of Moody's and Standard & Poor's and the difference is only one level (for example if Moody's is Level III and Standard & Poor's is Level II), the higher of such Debt Ratings (Standard & Poor's in the example in the preceding parenthetical - Level II) will determine the relevant pricing level.
(c)           If a difference exists in the Debt Ratings of Moody's and Standard & Poor's and the difference is two or more levels (for example if Moody's is Level IV and Standard & Poor's is Level II), the level which corresponds to the Debt Rating which is one level immediately above the lower of such Debt Ratings (Level III in the example in the preceding parenthetical) will determine the relevant pricing level.
(d)           If only one rating agency provides a Debt Rating, that Debt Rating is the only applicable Debt Rating.
 
 
 
 
 
(e)           Any increase or decrease in the Applicable Margin, the Applicable Facility Fee Percentage, the Applicable Commercial Letter of Credit Fee Percentage and the Applicable Standby Letter of Credit Fee Percentage shall become effective as of the date on which the applicable rating agency announces its change in the Debt Rating requiring such an increase or decrease; provided, however, (i) with respect to US Revolving Credit Loans in a US Optional Currency only, no change in pricing shall become effective until the end of the LIBOR Interest Period applicable to each such US Revolving Credit Loan and (ii)  with respect to Canadian Revolving Credit Loans in a Canadian Optional Currency only, no change in pricing shall become effective until the end of the LIBOR Interest Period applicable to each such Canadian Revolving Credit Loan.

The obligations of the Guarantors under this Agreement, when construed collectively with the obligations of any other Person that becomes a US Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, are intended to be the joint and several obligations of the Guarantors and such other Persons that become US Guarantors under the Credit Agreement, and this Agreement is intended to be an absolute and unconditional guaranty and suretyship for the aggregate of the US Debtor Liabilities.
EXTENT OF GUARANTORS' LIABILITY
 
- 2 -
 
Subject to the remainder of this paragraph, but otherwise notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the maximum liability of each Guarantor under this Agreement shall not exceed the sum of (i) that portion of the US Debtor Liabilities, the proceeds of which are used by the US Debtors to make Valuable Transfers (as hereinafter defined) to such Guarantor, plus (ii) ninety-five percent (95%) of the Adjusted Net Worth (as hereinafter defined), but only to the extent that Adjusted Net Worth is a positive number, of such Guarantor at the date of this Agreement.  For purposes of this paragraph:
"Adjusted Net Worth" shall mean, with respect to a Guarantor, as of any date of determination thereof, the excess of (i) the amount of the fair saleable value of the assets of such Guarantor as of the date of such determination, determined in accordance with applicable federal and state Laws governing determinations of insolvency of debtors, over (ii) the amount of all liabilities of such Guarantor, contingent or otherwise, as of the date of such determination, determined on the basis provided in the preceding clause (i), in all events prior to giving effect to Valuable Transfers.
"Valuable Transfers" shall mean, with respect to a Guarantor, without duplication, (a) all loans, advances, other credit accommodations, or capital contributions made to such Guarantor with proceeds of the Loans, (b) the amount of Letters of Credit Outstanding with respect to Letters of Credit issued to support the obligations or Indebtedness of such Guarantor, (c) all debt securities or other obligations or Indebtedness of such Guarantor acquired from such Guarantor or retired, redeemed, purchased or acquired by such Guarantor with proceeds of any Loans or any Letters of Credit issued to support the obligations or indebtedness of such Guarantor, (d) all equity securities of such Guarantor acquired from such Guarantor with the proceeds of any Loans or of any drawings on Letters of Credit issued to support the obligations of such Guarantor, (e) the fair market value of all property acquired with proceeds of the Loans or of any drawings on Letters of Credit issued to support the obligations or Indebtedness of such Guarantor and transferred to such Guarantor, (f) the interest on and the fees in respect of the Loans, the proceeds of which are used to make such a Valuable Transfer, and (g) the value of any quantifiable economic benefits not included in clauses (a) through (f) above, but includable in accordance with applicable federal and state Laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, accruing to such Guarantor as a result of the Loans or the Letters of Credit Outstanding.
The Guarantors agree that the US Debtor Liabilities may at any time and from time to time exceed the maximum liability of the Guarantors hereunder without impairing this Agreement or affecting the rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the US Banks hereunder.  No payment or payments made by the US Debtors or any other Person (other than the Guarantors) or received or collected by the Administrative Agent or any US Bank from the US Debtors or any other Person (other than the Guarantors) by virtue of any action or proceeding or any set-off or appropriation or application at any time or from time to time in reduction of or in payment of the US Debtor Liabilities shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability of the Guarantors under this Agreement, and each Guarantor shall, notwithstanding any such payment or payments (other than payments made to the Administrative Agent or any US Bank by the Guarantors or payments received or collected by the Administrative Agent or any US Bank from the Guarantors), remain liable for the US Debtor Liabilities up to its respective maximum liability amount as set forth in this paragraph until the US Debtor Liabilities are indefeasibly paid in full in cash (other than contingent indemnification and reimbursement obligations in respect of which no claim for payment has yet been asserted by the Person entitled thereto), each US Bank's obligation to make Loans is terminated according to the terms of the Credit Agreement, all US Letters of Credit have expired, have been cancelled or have been cash collateralized; provided, however, that, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Guarantors' liability under this paragraph exceed the maximum amount that, after giving effect to the incurring of the obligations hereunder and to any rights to contribution of the Guarantors from any US Debtor and other affiliates of any US Debtor, would not render the Administrative Agent's and the US Banks' right to payment hereunder void, voidable or avoidable under any applicable fraudulent transfer law; and further provided that if a greater amount of the US Debtor Liabilities than the maximum liability set forth in this paragraph could be repaid by the Guarantors as a result of an increase in any Guarantor's Adjusted Net Worth subsequent to the date of this Agreement, without rendering the Administrative Agent's and the US Banks' right to payment hereunder void, voidable or avoidable under any applicable fraudulent transfer law, then the amount of such Guarantor's maximum liability calculated in the first sentence of this paragraph shall be calculated based upon such Guarantor's Adjusted Net Worth on such later date, rather than the date of execution of this Agreement.
 
- 3 -
 
.  The Guarantors' liability hereunder is absolute and unconditional and shall not be reduced, limited, waived, or released in any way by reason of:  (i) any failure of the Administrative Agent or any US Bank to obtain, retain, preserve, perfect or enforce any of its rights against any Person (including without limitation, any Obligor) or in any property securing any or all of the US Debtor Liabilities; (ii) the invalidity or irregularity of any such rights that the Administrative Agent and the US Banks may attempt to obtain; (iii) any delay in enforcing or any failure to enforce such rights, even if such rights are thereby lost; (iv) any delay in making demand on any Obligor for payment or performance of any or all of the US Debtor Liabilities; or (v) from time to time, the payment in full and subsequent incurring of any US Debtor Liabilities.
UNCONDITIONAL LIABILITY
.  The Guarantors hereby waive all notice with respect to the present existence or future incurrence of any US Debtor Liabilities including, but not limited to, the amount, terms and conditions thereof.  The Guarantors hereby consent to the taking of, or failure to take, from time to time, any action of any nature whatsoever permitted by Law with respect to the US Debtor Liabilities and with respect to any rights against any Person or Persons (including, without limitation, any Obligor), or in any property including, without limitation, any renewals, extensions, modifications, postponements, compromises, indulgences, waivers, surrenders, exchanges and releases, and the Guarantors will remain fully liable hereunder notwithstanding any or all of the foregoing.  The granting of an express written release of any Guarantor's liability hereunder or any other Obligor's liability shall be effective only with respect to the liability hereunder of such Guarantor or Obligor who is specifically so expressly released but shall in no way affect the liability hereunder of any other Guarantor or any Obligor not so expressly released.  The dissolution of any Guarantor or any other Obligor shall in no way affect the liability hereunder or that of any other Obligor.  Each Guarantor hereby expressly waives:  (i) notices of acceptance hereof; (ii) any presentment, demand, protest, notice of default in connection with the US Debtor Liabilities, dishonor or notice of dishonor; (iii) any right of indemnification; and (iv) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense whatsoever to the liability of the US Debtors, or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or in discharge of, such Guarantor with respect to its obligations hereunder.
WAIVER

No payment by any Guarantor shall entitle any Obligor, by subrogation, contribution, indemnification or otherwise, to succeed to any of the rights of the Administrative Agent and the US Banks, including rights to any payment made on account of the US Debtor Liabilities, regardless of the source of such payment, until all of the US Debtors' obligations to the Administrative Agent and the US Banks under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents are satisfied in full (other than contingent indemnification and reimbursement obligations in respect of which no claim for payment has yet been asserted by the Person entitled thereto) and the US Revolving Credit Commitments and the US Swing Loan Commitments are terminated.  The Guarantors hereby waive any benefit of and any right to participate in any collateral security now or hereafter held by the Administrative Agent and the US Banks or any failure or refusal by the Administrative Agent and the US Banks to perfect an interest in any collateral security.
.  Neither the Guarantors' obligations to make payment in accordance with the terms of this Agreement nor any remedy for the enforcement hereof shall be impaired, modified, changed, released or limited in any manner whatsoever by a US Debtor's bankruptcy or by any impairment, modification, change, release or limitation of (i) the liability of any US Debtor, any Person assuming the obligations of any US Debtor under the Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or any US Debtor's estate in bankruptcy or (ii) any remedy for the enforcement of the US Debtor Liabilities, either of which result from the operation of any present or further provision of any bankruptcy act, Law or equitable cause or from the decision of any court.  The Guarantors agree that to the extent that any US Debtor or any other Obligor makes a payment or payments to the Administrative Agent or any US Bank, which payment or payments or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be paid to a trustee, receiver or any other Person under any bankruptcy act, Law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such payment, the US Debtor Liabilities or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if said payment had not been made.
BANKRUPTCY OF A US DEBTOR
.  In addition to all other liabilities of the Guarantors hereunder, the Guarantors also agree to pay to the Administrative Agent on demand all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and legal expenses) which may be incurred in the enforcement or collection of the liabilities of the Guarantors hereunder.
PAYMENT OF COSTS
.  The Guarantors agree that this Agreement may be enforced by the Administrative Agent and the US Banks without the necessity at any time of resorting to or exhausting any other security or collateral and without the necessity at any time of having recourse to the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, or any collateral now or hereafter securing the US Debtor Liabilities or otherwise, and the Guarantors hereby waive the right to require the Administrative Agent and the US Banks to proceed against any other Obligor or to require the Administrative Agent and the US Banks to pursue any other remedy or enforce any other right.  The Guarantors further agree that nothing contained herein shall prevent the Administrative Agent and the US Banks from suing on the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, or any of them, or foreclosing their Lien, if any, on any collateral hereafter securing the US Debtor Liabilities or from exercising any other rights available under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, or any other instrument of security if neither the US Debtors nor the Guarantors timely satisfy the US Debtor Liabilities thereunder, and the exercise of any of the aforesaid rights and the completion of any foreclosure proceedings shall not constitute a discharge of any of the obligations of the Guarantors thereunder; it being the purpose and intent of the Guarantors that the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute, independent and unconditional.  Neither the obligations of the Guarantors under this Agreement nor any remedy for the enforcement thereof shall be impaired, modified, changed or released in any manner whatsoever by an impairment, modification, change, release or limitation of the liability of any US Debtor or by reason of the bankruptcy or insolvency of any US Debtor.  If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by any US Debtor is stayed upon the insolvency or bankruptcy of such US Debtor, amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents including, without limitation, interest at the rates set forth in the Credit Agreement occurring after the date of such bankruptcy or insolvency, shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantors hereunder forthwith on demand by the Administrative Agent.  The Guarantors acknowledge that the term "US Debtor Liabilities" as used herein includes any payments made by any US Debtor to the Administrative Agent or the US Banks and subsequently recovered by such US Debtor or a trustee for such US Debtor pursuant to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings.
PRIMARY LIABILITY OF THE GUARANTORS
 
- 5 -
 
.  Upon the occurrence of any of the following events, all of the US Debtor Liabilities, at the Administrative Agent's and the US Banks' option, shall be deemed to be forthwith due and payable for the purposes of this Agreement and for determining the liability of the Guarantors hereunder, whether or not the Administrative Agent and the US Banks have any such rights against any other Obligor, and whether or not the Administrative Agent and the US Banks elect to exercise any rights or remedies against any other Person or property including, without limitation, any other Obligor:  (i) the failure of any Guarantor to perform any covenant or obligation hereunder; (ii) the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement which has not been cured; (iii) except as otherwise permitted pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the sale of all or substantially all of the assets, or change in ownership, or the dissolution, merger, consolidation or reorganization of any Guarantor; (iv) any information or signature heretofore or hereafter furnished to the Administrative Agent or any US Bank by any Guarantor, or delivered to the Administrative Agent or any US Bank by an Obligor in connection with any of the US Debtor Liabilities, is materially false or incorrect at the time when made; or (v) the failure of any Guarantor or any Obligor to furnish the Administrative Agent and the US Banks such financial and other information as required by the Loan Documents.
ACCELERATION OF THE GUARANTORS' LIABILITIES
.  All rights and remedies of the Guarantors against the US Debtors or any property of any US Debtor or any collateral security for any of the US Debtor Liabilities, whether arising by promissory note, subrogation, security agreement, mortgage or otherwise, shall in all respects be and remain subordinate and junior in right of payment and priority to the prior and indefeasible payment in full to the Administrative Agent and the US Banks of all US Debtor Liabilities (other than contingent indemnification and reimbursement obligations in respect of which no claim for payment has yet been asserted by the Person entitled thereto) and to the priority of the Administrative Agent and the US Banks in any property of any US Debtor and any collateral security for any of the US Debtor Liabilities.  Any amount which may have been paid to the Guarantors on account of any indebtedness of the US Debtors to the Guarantors, or on account of any subrogation or other rights of the Guarantors against the US Debtors, when all of the US Debtor Liabilities (other than contingent indemnification and reimbursement obligations in respect of which no claim for payment has yet been asserted by the Person entitled thereto and US Letter of Credit Obligations that have been cash collateralized) shall not have been indefeasibly paid in full, shall be held by the undersigned in trust for the benefit of the US Banks and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited and applied upon the US Debtor Liabilities, whether matured or unmatured.

THIS INTERCOMPANY SUBORDINATION AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is dated July 22, 2011 and is made by and among the entities listed on the signature page hereto (or subsequently joining this Agreement) (each being individually referred to herein as a "Loan Party" and collectively as the "Loan Parties") for the benefit of PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (in such capacity, the "Administrative Agent"), for the Banks (as hereinafter defined) and the Canadian Agent (as hereinafter defined), and PNC Bank Canada Branch, as funding agent (in such capacity, the "Canadian Agent") for the Canadian Banks (as defined in the Credit Agreement (as hereinafter defined)).
WHEREAS, each capitalized term used herein shall, unless otherwise defined herein, have the meaning specified in the Credit Agreement, dated of even date herewith (as may be amended, modified, restated or supplemented from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"), by and among Big Lots Stores, Inc., an Ohio corporation ("BLS"), Big Lots, Inc., an Ohio corporation ("Parent"), Big Lots Canada, Inc., an Alberta corporation ("BLC" and, together with BLS and Parent, collectively, the "Borrowers"), the Guarantors party thereto, the Banks party thereto, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and U.S. Bank National Association, as joint syndication agents for the Banks, Branch Banking and Trust Company, Compass Bank, and The Huntington National Bank, each as a co-documentation agent for the Banks, the Administrative Agent, and the Canadian Agent; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the Banks intend to make Loans to the Borrowers; and
WHEREAS, certain Loan Parties are guarantors of certain obligations of the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement pursuant to the Guaranty Agreements dated of even date herewith; and
WHEREAS, the Loan Parties are or may become indebted to each other (the Indebtedness of each of the Loan Parties to any other Loan Party, now existing or hereafter incurred (whether created directly or acquired by assignment or otherwise), and interest and premiums, if any, thereon and other amounts payable in respect thereof are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Intercompany Indebtedness") and are permitted to dissolve or merge in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement; and
WHEREAS, the obligations of the Banks to maintain the Commitments and make Loans to the Borrowers from time to time are subject to the condition, among others, that the Loan Parties subordinate the Intercompany Indebtedness to the Indebtedness and all other Obligations of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party to the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Agent or the Banks pursuant to the Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents (collectively, the "Senior Debt") in the manner set forth herein.
 
 
 
NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto covenant and agree as follows:
1.             .  The recitals set forth above are hereby incorporated by reference.  All Intercompany Indebtedness shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior Payment In Full of all Senior Debt pursuant to the provisions contained herein.
Intercompany Indebtedness Subordinated to Senior Debt
2.             .  Upon any distribution of assets of any Loan Party in connection with (a) any insolvency or bankruptcy case or proceeding, or any receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar case or proceeding in connection therewith, relative to any such Loan Party or to its creditors, as such, or to its assets, or (b) any assignment for the benefit of creditors or any marshalling of assets and liabilities of any such Loan Party (a Loan Party distributing assets as set forth herein being referred to in such capacity as a "Distributing Loan Party"), then and in any such event, the Administrative Agent and the Canadian Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Agent and the Banks as their respective interests may appear, Payment In Full of all amounts due or to become due, if an Event of Default has occurred under the terms of the Loan Documents or the Senior Debt has been declared due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise have become due and payable, other than pursuant to Section 4.7 of the Credit Agreement (each, a "Triggering Event"), on or in respect of any and all Senior Debt before the holder of any Intercompany Indebtedness owed by the Distributing Loan Party is entitled to receive any payment on account of the principal of or interest on such Intercompany Indebtedness, and to that end, the Administrative Agent and the Canadian Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive, for application to the payment of the Senior Debt, any payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, which may be payable or deliverable in respect of the Intercompany Indebtedness owed by the Distributing Loan Party in any such case, proceeding, dissolution, liquidation or other winding up event.
Payment Over of Proceeds Upon Bankruptcy, Etc
If, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, after the occurrence of a Triggering Event, a Loan Party which is owed Intercompany Indebtedness by a Distributing Loan Party shall have received any payment or distribution of assets from the Distributing Loan Party of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, then and in such event such payment or distribution shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Agent and the Banks as their respective interests may appear, shall be segregated from other funds and property held by such Loan Party, and shall be forthwith paid over to the Administrative Agent in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement) to be applied (in the case of cash) to or held as collateral (in the case of noncash property or securities) for the payment or prepayment of the Senior Debt in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
3.             .  Each Loan Party agrees that, so long as the Senior Debt shall remain unpaid, it will not commence, or join with any creditor other than the Banks, the Administrative Agent and the Canadian Agent in commencing any proceeding referred to in the first paragraph of Section 2 against any other Loan Party which owes it any Intercompany Indebtedness.
No Commencement of Any Proceeding
 
- 2 -
 
4.             .  If a Triggering Event shall have occurred and be continuing, or would result from or exist after giving effect to a payment with respect to any portion of the Intercompany Indebtedness, unless the Required Banks shall have consented to or waived the same, so long as Payment In Full has not occurred, no payment shall be made by any Loan Party owing such Intercompany Indebtedness on account of principal or interest on any portion of the Intercompany Indebtedness except to the extent that the proceeds of such payment are used by the Loan Party receiving such proceeds to immediately apply the same to the Senior Debt.
No Payment When Senior Debt in Default
If, notwithstanding the foregoing, any Loan Party shall make any payment of the Intercompany Indebtedness to another Loan Party prohibited by the foregoing provisions of this Section, such payment shall be paid over and delivered forthwith to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Agent and the Banks as their respective interests may appear.
5.             .  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent any of the Loan Parties, at any time except during the pendency of any of the conditions described in Sections 2 and 4 hereof, from making payments at any time of principal of or interest on any portion of the Intercompany Indebtedness, or the retention thereof by any of the Loan Parties of any money deposited with them for the payment of or on account of the principal of or interest on the Intercompany Indebtedness.
Payment Permitted if No Default
6.             .  Each Loan Party agrees that no payment or distribution to the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Agent or the Banks pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement shall entitle it to exercise any rights of subrogation in respect thereof until Payment In Full.
Rights of Subrogation
7.             .  Each Loan Party shall cause each instrument, if any, which now or hereafter evidences all or a portion of the Intercompany Indebtedness to be conspicuously marked as follows:
Instruments Evidencing Intercompany Indebtedness
"This instrument is subject to the terms of an Intercompany Subordination Agreement dated July 22, 2011 in favor of PNC Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent for the Banks referred to therein, and PNC Bank Canada Branch, as Canadian Agent for the Canadian Banks referred to therein, which Intercompany Subordination Agreement is incorporated herein by reference.  Notwithstanding any contrary statement contained in the within instrument, no payment on account of the principal thereof or interest thereon shall become due or payable except in accordance with the express terms of said Intercompany Subordination Agreement."
8.             .  The purpose of this Agreement is solely to define the relative rights of the Loan Parties, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Agent and the Banks, on the other hand.  Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to or shall impair, as between any of the Loan Parties and their creditors other than the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Agent and the Banks, the obligation of the Loan Parties to each other to pay the principal of and interest on the Intercompany Indebtedness as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with its terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights among the Loan Parties and their creditors other than the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Agent and the Banks, nor shall anything herein prevent any of the Loan Parties from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable Law upon default under any agreement pursuant to which the Intercompany Indebtedness is created, subject to the rights, if any, under this Agreement of the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Agent and the Banks to receive cash, property or securities otherwise payable or deliverable with respect to the Intercompany Indebtedness.
Agreement Solely to Define Relative Rights
 
- 3 -
 
9.             .  No right of the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Agent or any Bank to enforce subordination, as herein provided, shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of any Loan Party or by any act or failure to act by the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Agent or any Bank, or by any non-compliance by any Loan Party with the terms, provisions and covenants of any agreement pursuant to which the Intercompany Indebtedness is created, regardless of any knowledge thereof the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Agent or any Bank may have or be otherwise charged with.  Each Loan Party by its acceptance hereof shall agree that, so long as Payment In Full has not occurred, such Loan Party shall not agree to sell, assign, pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of, or to compromise, the obligations of the other Loan Parties with respect to their Intercompany Indebtedness, other than by means of payment of such Intercompany Indebtedness according to its terms or the sale, assignment, pledge or transfer to another Loan Party, without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.
No Implied Waivers of Subordination
Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, to the extent, if any, permitted by the Credit Agreement, the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Agent or any of the Banks may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Loan Parties except the Borrowers to the extent provided in the Credit Agreement, without incurring responsibility to the Loan Parties and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Agreement or the obligations hereunder of the Loan Parties to the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Agent and the Banks, do any one or more of the following: (i) change the manner, place or terms of payment, or extend the time of payment, renew or alter the Senior Debt or otherwise amend or supplement the Senior Debt or the Loan Documents; (ii) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing the Senior Debt, if any; (iii) release any Person liable in any manner for the payment or collection of the Senior Debt; and (iv) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against any of the Loan Parties and any other Person.
10.           .  The Loan Parties covenant and agree that they shall cause Subsidiaries created or acquired after the date of this Agreement that are required to join this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.2.8 of the Credit Agreement, to execute a joinder in the form of Exhibit 1.1(G)(1) to the Credit Agreement, whereby such Subsidiary joins this Agreement and subordinates all Indebtedness owed to any such Subsidiary by any of the Loan Parties or other Subsidiaries hereafter created or acquired to the Senior Debt.
Additional Subsidiaries
11.           .  This Agreement shall continue in force until Payment In Full.

12.           .  Any and all agreements amending or changing any provision of this Agreement or the rights of the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Agent or the Banks hereunder, and any and all waivers or consents to departures from the due performance by the Loan Parties of their obligations hereunder, shall be made only by written agreement, waiver or consent signed by the Administrative Agent and the Canadian Agent, acting on behalf of all the Banks, with the written consent of the Required Banks, any such agreement, waiver or consent made with such written consent being effective to bind all the Banks and, with respect to amendments or changes to any provision of this Agreement, signed by the Borrowers, acting on behalf of the Loan Parties.

The Loan Parties unconditionally and jointly and severally agree upon demand to pay to the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Agent and the Banks the amount of any and all reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket costs, expenses and disbursements for which reimbursement is customarily obtained, including fees and expenses of counsel, which the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Agent or any of the Banks may incur in connection with (a) the administration of this Agreement, (b) the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Agent or the Banks hereunder, or (c) the failure by the Loan Parties to perform or observe any of the provisions hereof.
Expenses
14.           .  The provisions of this Agreement are intended to be severable.  If any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without in any manner affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions hereof in any jurisdiction.
Severability
15.           .  This Agreement shall be a contract under the internal Laws of the State of Ohio and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Ohio without giving effect to its principles of conflict of laws.

18.           .  Each of the Loan Parties hereby authorizes and empowers each of the Administrative Agent and the Canadian Agent, at its election at any time after the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default and the acceleration of the Senior Debt and in the name of either itself, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Agent and the Banks as their respective interests may appear, or in the name of each such Loan Party as is owed Intercompany Indebtedness, to execute and file proofs and documents and take any other action the Administrative Agent or the Canadian Agent may deem advisable to completely protect the Administrative Agent's, the Canadian Agent's and the Banks' interests in the Intercompany Indebtedness and their right of enforcement thereof, and to that end each of the Loan Parties hereby irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints the Administrative Agent and the Canadian Agent, their officers, employees and agents, or any of them, with full power of substitution, as the true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent of such Loan Party, and with full power for such Loan Party, and in the name, place and stead of such Loan Party for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Agreement, and taking any action and executing, delivering, filing and recording any instruments which the Administrative Agent or the Canadian Agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof, which power of attorney, being given for security, is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable.

Exhibit 99.1
 
PRESS RELEASE
Columbus, Ohio  July 25, 2011  Big Lots, Inc. (NYSE: BIG) today announced the signing of a new $700 million five-year unsecured revolving credit facility which includes a $200 million Canadian Dollar sub-facility allowing us to efficiently support the growth of our newly acquired Canadian operations. The new facility will replace our prior $500 million credit facility which was set to expire in April 2012.
 
Commenting on todays announcement, Steve Fishman, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President stated, This new, larger facility demonstrates the relationship we have with our key banking partners and the strength of our financial performance and credit profile.  Each of the banks in our prior bank deal remained with us and actually increased their commitment levels in our new facility.  Additionally, we welcomed two new banks into the group which ultimately resulted in an over-subscription of the deal.  We look forward to working with the entire bank group to support our growth plans in both the U.S. and Canada.
 
The new facility was arranged jointly by PNC Capital Markets, Wells Fargo Bank and U.S. Bank.  The new facility will be used to fund working capital needs and for general corporate purposes.  The structure and financial covenants of the new facility are substantially the same as our prior facility and will be described in a Form 8-K filing later this week.
Big Lots is North Americas largest broadline closeout retailer.  Currently, we operate 1,412 stores in the 48 contiguous United States and 89 and stores in Canada.  Wholesale operations are conducted through andOur website is located at www.biglots.com.
