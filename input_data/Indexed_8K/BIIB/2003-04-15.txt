Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Nasdaq: IDPH) today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2003.  Total revenues for the first quarter ended March 31, 2003 were $117.2 million, compared to $79.7 million for the first quarter of 2002. Net income was $41.2 million, or $0.24 per share on a diluted basis, compared to $29.7 million, or $0.17 per share on a diluted basis, for the same period in 2002.
SAN DIEGO, California, (April 15, 2003):
 
Revenues for the first quarter of 2003 included $110.9 million recorded for IDEC's joint business arrangement with Genentech, Inc. for the commercialization of Rituxan (Rituximab), which IDEC copromotes in the U.S. with Genentech, compared to $78.2 million for the first quarter of 2002. Revenues in the first quarter of 2003 also included $5.7 million in U.S. net sales of Zevalin (ibritumomab tiuxetan) which IDEC markets alone in the U.S. and was launched in April 2002.
 
Rituxan Revenues
 
U.S. net sales of Rituxan in the first quarter of 2003, as recorded by Genentech, were $310 million compared to $235 million for the same period in 2002.
 
"Rituxan sales continue to drive growth in earnings," said William R. Rohn, IDEC's president and chief operating officer. "Net U.S. sales increased $75 million in the first quarter, representing a 32 percent increase from the same quarter last year."
 
Worldwide net sales of Rituxan during the first quarter of 2003 of $341 million, as reported by Genentech, included $31 million of ex-US sales to its partners F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. and Zenyaku Kogyo Co. Ltd. of Japan. IDEC's royalty revenue on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. is based on Roche's and Zenyaku's end-user sales and is recorded with a one-quarter lag. IDEC recognized, during the first quarter of 2003, $14.7 million in royalties from Roche's and Zenyaku's end-user sales during the fourth quarter of 2002.
 
Revenues from unconsolidated joint business reflect the financial results from the commercialization of Rituxan by IDEC and Genentech. Revenues from unconsolidated joint business includes various revenues associated with Rituxan commercialization such as IDEC's share of the pretax copromotion profits, reimbursements from Genentech for IDEC's Rituxan-related sales force and development expenses, and royalty revenues on sales of Rituximab outside the United States by Roche and Zenyaku.  Roche has marketing rights to Rituximab outside of the U.S., and copromotes Rituxan in Japan with Zenyaku.
 
IDEC's share of copromotion profits is received in two tiers, a lower tier that resets annually at the beginning of each year and a higher tier that applies once a certain copromotion profit level is met. IDEC's profit-sharing formula was reset to the lower tier on January 1, 2003. The profit-sharing formula increased to the higher tier in January 2003 when the annual fixed copromotion profit level was achieved.
 
Operating Costs and Expenses
 
Operating costs and expenses for the first quarter of 2003 increased to $54.1 million from $38.1 million for the first quarter of 2002. The higher 2003 operating expenses are primarily the result of increased sales and marketing expenses to support commercialization of Zevalin, increased research and development expenses resulting from the expansion of our product development pipeline, and increased personnel, facility and insurance expenses.
 
Cash Position
 
IDEC ended the first quarter of 2003 with cash, cash equivalents and securities available-for-sale totaling $1.5 billion.
