Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
SAN DIEGO, California, (July 17, 2003):
IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Nasdaq: IDPH) today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2003.  Net income was $28.8 million, or $0.17 per share on a diluted basis, compared to $35.4 million, or $0.20 per share on a diluted basis, for the same period in 2002.  Net income for the second quarter of 2003 includes a $20 million one-time signing payment ($12.4 million after tax) made to Genentech, Inc. in association with the new anti-CD20 antibody development collaboration between IDEC and Genentech announced on June 20, 2003.  The signing payment to Genentech was recorded to research and development expense in the second quarter of 2003.  Excluding the one-time signing payment to Genentech, net income for the second quarter of 2003 would have been $41.2 million, or $0.24 per share on a diluted basis, a 20% increase on a per share basis over the same period in 2002.  (See accompanying table for a reconciliation of reported GAAP results to non-GAAP results.)
 
Total revenues for the second quarter ended June 30, 2003 were $123.6 million, compared to $97.1 million for the second quarter of 2002.  Revenues for the second quarter of 2003 included $118.4 million recorded for IDEC's joint business arrangement with Genentech for the commercialization of Rituxan (Rituximab), which IDEC copromotes in the U.S. with Genentech, compared to $92.5 million for the second quarter of 2002.  Revenues in the second quarter of 2003 also included $5.0 million in U.S. net sales of Zevalin (ibritumomab tiuxetan), which IDEC markets alone in the U.S. and was launched in April 2002, compared to $3.3 million for the second quarter of 2002.
 
Rituxan Revenues
 
U.S. net sales of Rituxan in the second quarter of 2003, as recorded by Genentech, were $328 million compared to $257 million for the same period in 2002.
 
"We were very pleased with the performance of Rituxan in the second quarter," said William R. Rohn, IDEC's president and chief operating officer. "Net U.S. sales increased $71 million in the second quarter, representing a 28 percent increase from the same quarter last year."
 
IDEC's royalty revenue on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. is based on Roche's and Zenyaku's end-user sales and is recorded with a one-quarter lag.  IDEC recognized, during the second quarter of 2003, $13.9 million in royalties from Roche's and Zenyaku's end-user sales during the first quarter of 2003.
Revenues from unconsolidated joint business reflect the financial results from the commercialization of Rituxan by IDEC and Genentech.  Revenues from unconsolidated joint business includes various revenues associated with Rituxan commercialization such as IDEC's share of pretax copromotion profits, reimbursements from Genentech for IDEC's Rituxan-related sales force and development expenses, and royalty revenues on sales of Rituximab outside the United States by Roche and Zenyaku.  Roche has marketing rights to Rituximab outside of the U.S., and copromotes Rituxan in Japan with Zenyaku.
 
 
Operating Costs and Expenses
Operating costs and expenses for the second quarter of 2003 increased to $80.4 million from $47.1 million for the second quarter of 2002.  The higher 2003 operating expenses are primarily the result of the $20 million one-time signing payment made to Genentech, the write-off of $3.1 million of Zevalin commercial inventory that did not meet quality specifications, increased legal expenses to protect IDEC's intellectual property rights, and increased sales and marketing expenses to support commercialization of Zevalin.
Cash Position
IDEC ended the second quarter of 2003 with cash, cash equivalents and securities available-for-sale totaling $1.5 billion.
