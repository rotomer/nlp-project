ARTICLE 8 MANUFACTURE AND SUPPLY
IDEC shall be responsible for, at its own expense, process development, scale-up, validation and FDA licensure of its existing C2B8-producing CHO cell line to the 2,750 liter fermenter scale.  As soon as practicable after the Original Effective Date, IDEC will transfer to Genentech a re-amplified CHO C2B8-producing cell line, and, within 30 days of the Original Effective Date, transfer the technology to be licensed to Genentech under the terms and conditions of the Expression Technology License of even date herewith, and provide reasonable training of Genentech personnel as requested by Genentech necessary to allow Genentech to scale up C2B8 process with the re-amplified cell line.  Immediately after receipt of IDEC's re-amplified CHO C2B8 producing cell line by Genentech, Genentech will begin work, at its own expense, on the scale-up of a re-amplified cell line in optimal growth media to produce C2B8 at commercial scale.  If Genentech determines that such scale up is not commercially feasible, it will so notify the JDC.  Upon the decision of the JDC to go forward, Genentech will, at its own expense, attempt to scale

up another cell line selected by the JDC or the cell line used for 2,750 liter fermenter scale production.  If Genentech has successfully scaled up a cell line to its commercial scale and IDEC is then manufacturing C2B8, Genentech will, at its own expense, transfer the optimized cell line and information sufficient to allow IDEC to manufacture C2B8 by essentially the same process used by Genentech except for the size of the fermentation vessel.  If bridging or any other studies are required to permit the use or sale of C2B8 produced by Genentech by the optimized process, the costs of such clinical studies shall be paid by Genentech, but shall be charged against Operating Profits over the first three years after the first commercial sale of C2B8 produced by the optimized process.  IDEC will otherwise be responsible, at its own expense, for all expenses incurred in obtaining Regulatory Approvals for the manufacturing process used to produce C2B8, except that Genentech, at its own expense, will pay the expenses incurred to receive FDA licensure of Genentech facilities.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.1, costs incurred by either Party under this Section 8.1 after Regulatory Approval in the United States shall be charged to Operating Profits.
 
IDEC shall, pursuant to a Supply Agreement to be entered into between the Parties prior to the date of the first submission of an application or registration for Regulatory Approval, supply all requirements for C2B8 in final vial form for commercial sale in all territories for the first two years after the first Regulatory Approval in the United States or Europe, whichever comes earlier (the "Initial Commercial Period").  The average annual Cost of Goods Sold of C2B8 packaged in final vial form during the Initial Commercial Period shall be the lower of (i) or (ii) .  IDEC may continue to supply, at its option, commercial requirements for C2B8 up to the capacity of its current manufacturing plant in San Diego (the "Supply Option").  The Supply Option shall be exercised, if at all, by written notice on or before the date of the first Regulatory Approval including a good faith estimate of IDEC's planned production levels.  If the parties determine that the FDA will not grant establishment licenses to two manufacturing facilities using different scales of production, then the parties will use best efforts to develop a manufacturing capacity plan by the first Regulatory Approval.  Subsequent to the Initial Commercial Period, if both Parties are manufacturing Licensed Product at the same time, the Cost of Goods Sold for both Parties used for calculation of Operating Profits shall be the lower of Genentech's or IDEC's actual cost of Goods Sold for commercial production of C2B8 packaged in final vial form.  After the Initial Commercial Period, Genentech shall manufacture all requirements of C2B8 for commercial sale in excess of that which IDEC has agreed to produce.

Genentech and IDEC Announce Humanized Anti-CD20 Antibody Development Collaboration
Friday June 20, 4:19 pm ET
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. and SAN DIEGO(BUSINESS WIRE)June 20, 2003Genentech, Inc. (NYSE:DNA - News) and IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Nasdaq:IDPH - News) today announced plans to develop one or more new humanized anti-CD20 antibodies targeting B-cell disorders for a broad range of indications. Financial terms of the profit-sharing collaboration were not disclosed.
 
Genentech and IDEC plan to file an investigational new drug application (IND) on their first humanized anti-CD20 antibody by the end of this year. The companies plan to work efficiently together to develop and commercialize additional anti-CD20 products that are targeted for specific patient populations, depending on the severity of their B-cell disorder. The primary focus of this collaboration will be to develop and launch a humanized anti-CD20 molecule while evaluating the utility for more efficacious follow-on humanized molecules.
 
Humanized anti-CD20 antibodies work by binding to a particular protein (the CD20 antigen) on the surface of normal and malignant B-cells. From there, they recruit the body's natural defenses to attack and kill the marked B-cells. Stem cells (B-cell progenitors) in bone marrow lack the CD20 antigen, allowing healthy B-cells to regenerate after treatment and return to normal levels within several months.
 
This
will be the second collaboration between Genentech and IDEC. In 1995, Genentech and IDEC signed an agreement to develop and market Rituxan (Rituximab), a chimeric anti-CD20 antibody. In November 1997, Rituxan became the first recombinant antibody to receive U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for cancer in the United States, and in 2002, had sales of more than $1 billion. More than 300,000 patients have been treated to date with Rituxan worldwide. Rituxan is indicated for the single-agent treatment of relapsed or refractory low-grade or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).
 
"We are delighted to broaden our already successful collaboration with Genentech," said William R. Rohn, IDEC's president and chief operating officer. "Our plan to develop a humanized anti-CD20 antibody is both an opportunity to strengthen our current oncology franchise as well as to extend it into a variety of autoimmune disease indications."
"This collaboration should help the companies to continue to play a leading role in addressing B-cell disorders," said Joseph S. McCracken, vice president of Business and Commercial Development of Genentech. "We look forward to expanding our relationship with IDEC and developing one or more new molecules that may provide significant benefit to patients with B-cell mediated diseases."
