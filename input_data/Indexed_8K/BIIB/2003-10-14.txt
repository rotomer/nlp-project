Exhibit 99.1
 
SAN DIEGO, California, (October 14, 2003):
IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Nasdaq: IDPH) today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2003.  Net income was $45.5 million, or $0.26 per share on a diluted basis, compared to $38.4 million, or $0.22 per share on a diluted basis, for the same period in 2002.
Total revenues for the third quarter ended September 30, 2003 were $138.5 million, compared to $103.7 million for the third quarter of 2002.  Revenues for the third quarter of 2003 included $134.0 million recorded for IDEC's joint business arrangement with Genentech for the commercialization of Rituxan (Rituximab), which IDEC copromotes in the U.S. with Genentech, compared to $98.6 million for the third quarter of 2002.  Revenues in the third quarter of 2003 also included $4.4 million in U.S. net sales of Zevalin (ibritumomab tiuxetan), which IDEC markets alone in the U.S. and was launched in April 2002, compared to $5.0 million for the third quarter of 2002.
Rituxan Revenues
U.S. net sales of Rituxan in the third quarter of 2003, as recorded by Genentech, were $354 million compared to $270 million for the same period in 2002.
"Rituxan sales produced another notable performance in the third quarter of this year,"  said William R. Rohn, IDEC's president and chief operating officer. "Net U.S. sales increased $84 million in the third quarter, representing a 31 percent increase from the same quarter last year."
 
The net sales of Rituxan reported by Genentech in the third quarter included $18 million of ex-U.S. sales to its partners F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. and Zenyaku Kogyo Co. Ltd. of Japan.  IDEC's royalty revenue on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. is based on Roche's and Zenyaku's end-user sales and is recorded with a one-quarter lag.  IDEC recognized, during the third quarter of 2003, $18.7 million in royalties from Roche's and Zenyaku's end-user sales during the second quarter of 2003.
 
Revenues from unconsolidated joint business reflect the financial results from the commercialization of Rituxan by IDEC and Genentech.  Revenues from unconsolidated joint business includes various revenues associated with Rituxan commercialization such as IDEC's share of pretax copromotion profits, reimbursements from Genentech for IDEC's Rituxan-related sales force and development expenses, and royalty revenues on sales of Rituximab outside the United States by Roche and Zenyaku.  Roche has
 
marketing rights to Rituximab outside of the U.S., and copromotes Rituxan in Japan with Zenyaku.
 
Operating Costs and Expenses
 
Operating costs and expenses for the third quarter of 2003 increased to $67.1 million from $49.4 million for the third quarter of 2002.  The higher 2003 operating expenses are primarily the result of increased legal expenses to protect IDEC's intellectual property rights, increased sales and marketing expenses to support commercialization of Zevalin, increased personnel and facility expenses, and increased research and development expenses due to decreased capitalization of IDEC's manufacturing costs, as our manufacturing facilities were primarily used to support products in development in the third quarter of 2003.
 
Cash Position
 
IDEC ended the third quarter of 2003 with cash, cash equivalents and securities available-for-sale totaling $1.5 billion.
