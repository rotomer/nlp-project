FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Cambridge, MA, February 7, 2005  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB), the world's third largest biotech company with leading products and capabilities in oncology and immunology, today reported its fourth quarter and full year 2004 results.
Fourth Quarter & Full Year Highlights
 
Page 2 Biogen Idec Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2004 Earnings
excluding merger-related accounting impacts and other non-operating charges, adjusted pro forma non-GAAP EPS were $0.34.
James Mullen, Biogen Idec's Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Biogen Idec had a momentous year in 2004, highlighted by the approval of TYSABRI based on one-year data. Our major R&D programs experienced their most productive year and strong performance in AVONEX and RITUXAN fueled revenue growth of 19% to $2.2 billion. This puts us on track to meet our long-term goals of achieving approximately 15% top and 20% bottom line operating performance."
Financial Performance
On an adjusted non-GAAP basis, Biogen Idec reported net income of $121 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 (Q4 2003 adjusted pro forma non-GAAP: $91 million) and $518 million for the full year 2004 (2003 adjusted pro forma non-GAAP: $432 million). Adjusted non-GAAP EPS was $0.34 for the fourth quarter of 2004 (Q4 2003 adjusted pro forma non-GAAP: $0.25) and $1.44 for the full year 2004 (2003 adjusted pro forma non-GAAP: $1.22).
These adjustments are itemized on the attached reconciliation tables. Adjusted non-GAAP EPS and net income for the fourth quarter and full year of 2004 exclude merger-related accounting impacts, such as amortization of intangibles, impairment of intangibles, inventory step up, and other merger-related charges, and other non-operating charges. Adjusted pro forma non-GAAP EPS and net income for the fourth quarter and full year of 2003 include revenue and expenses from the former Biogen, Inc. from January 1 to November 12, 2003 (date of merger) but excludes similar merger-related accounting impacts excluded from fourth quarter and full year 2004 adjusted non-GAAP EPS and other non-operating charges of the former Biogen, Inc. and IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation.
On a reported basis, calculated in accordance with GAAP, Biogen Idec reported net income of $48 million (or EPS of $0.14) in the fourth quarter of 2004 and net income of $45 million (or EPS of $0.13) for the full year 2004. The difference between adjusted non-GAAP net income and EPS and GAAP net income and EPS in the fourth quarter and full year were primarily due to non-cash merger-related accounting impacts of $88 million and $656 million, respectively. Full year 2004 was also impacted by a $13 million write-down of certain investments.
Revenue Performance

Revenues from AVONEX, Biogen Idec's therapy for patients with relapsing forms of MS, increased 19 % in the fourth quarter to $370 million (Q4 2003 adjusted pro forma non-GAAP: $310 million). Full year AVONEX sales increased 21 % to $1.42 billion (2003 adjusted pro forma non-GAAP: $1.17 billion). In 2004, U.S. sales were $922 million and international sales were $495 million.
Revenues from AMEVIVE(alefacept), Biogen Idec's treatment for moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis, were $10 million in the fourth quarter (Q4 2003 adjusted pro forma non-GAAP: $17 million) and $43 million for the full year (2003 adjusted pro forma non-GAAP: $40 million).
Revenues from ZEVALIN (ibritumomab tiuxetan), Biogen Idec's radioimmunotherapeutic agent for relapsed or refractory low-grade, follicular or transformed B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), were $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 (Q4 2003: $5 million) and $23 million for the full year (2003: $20 million).
Revenues from TYSABRI, Biogen Idec's therapy for patients with relapsing forms of MS, were $3 million in the fourth quarter.
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2004 and full year 2004 included $170 million (Q4 2003: $130 million) and $615 million (2003: $493 million), respectively, from Biogen Idec's joint business arrangement with Genentech, Inc. related to RITUXAN, a treatment for certain B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas that Biogen Idec co-promotes in the U.S. with Genentech. All U.S. sales of RITUXAN are recognized by Genentech, and Biogen Idec records its share of the pretax co-promotion profits on a quarterly basis. U.S. net sales of RITUXAN were $429 million in the fourth quarter (Q4 2003: $369 million) and $1.57 billion for the full year (2003: $1.36 billion), as reported by Genentech.
Royalties were $25 million in the fourth quarter (Q4 2003 adjusted pro forma non-GAAP: $27 million) and $98 million for the full year (2003 adjusted pro forma non-GAAP: $127 million).
Financial Guidance
Biogen Idec today reaffirmed its long-term goal of achieving 15% compound annual revenue growth, and approximately 20% compound annual earnings per share (adjusted pro forma non-GAAP) growth through 2007.
Given the launch investments behind TYSABRI, the Company is anticipating low double-digit growth for revenue and adjusted non-GAAP earnings in 2005. On this non-GAAP basis, the Company expects operating expenses to grow 1214% over 2004 levels and its effective tax rate for 2005 to be in the range of 3133%. As a result, the Company estimates that its 2005 non-GAAP earnings per share will be in the range of $1.60 to the low $1.70's.
The Company anticipates that 2005 capital expenditures will be in the range of $400  $475 million. A significant portion of these expenditures will be directed towards the

completion of the Oceanside manufacturing facility and the construction of a large-scale manufacturing facility in Denmark.

Safe Harbor
This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding expected future financial results and plans for our development programs, including TYSABRI.
These statements are based on the Company's current beliefs and expectations. A number of risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially. For example, financial results, including future revenue and EPS growth, anticipated levels of expenses, other statements regarding future financial performance, and overall prospects for the Company's products may be affected by a number of factors, including the degree and timing of market acceptance of TYSABRI, any unexpected slowing of growth of the markets for AVONEX and RITUXAN, any change in market acceptance of these products in key markets worldwide, the impact of reimbursement and pricing decisions related to the Company's products, particularly TYSABRI, the impact of competitive products on the Company's products, any material decreases in sales by licensees of products on which the Company receives royalties, the impact of litigation, the impact of costs related to the launch of TYSABRI, any unanticipated increase in expenses related to in-licensing and product opportunities, increases in costs related to development of new products and existing products in new indications, and any material issues, delays or failures related to the manufacturing or supply of the Company's products
.
Drug development and commercialization involve a high degree of risk. For example, our development and commercialization of TYSABRI as a treatment for MS could be negatively affected if unexpected concerns arise from additional data, including the two-year data from the Phase 3 trial, once unblinded, or if we were to encounter other unexpected hurdles.
For more detailed information on the risks and uncertainties associated with these forward looking statements and the Company's other activities see the periodic reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
