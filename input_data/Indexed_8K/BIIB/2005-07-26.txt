"Impressive results from AVONEX and RITUXAN coupled with an operational discipline and effective cost management drove an increase of more than 20% in earnings," said James Mullen, Biogen Idec's Chief Executive Officer. "We have also maintained our strong commitment to the MS community by conducting an extensive safety evaluation of TYSABRI which is ongoing. We look forward to the expected completion of the evaluation by the end of the summer and to further discussions with the regulatory authorities regarding the path forward for TYSABRI."

These statements are based on the Company's current beliefs and expectations. A number of risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially. For example, financial results, and other statements regarding future financial performance, and overall prospects for the Company's products may be affected by a number of factors, including any unexpected slowing of growth of the markets for AVONEX and RITUXAN, any change in market acceptance of AVONEX and RITUXAN in key markets worldwide, the impact of reimbursement and pricing decisions related to the Company's products, the impact of competitive products on the Company's products, any material decreases in sales by licensees of products on which the Company receives royalties, the impact of litigation, the impact of costs related to the suspension of TYSABRI, increases in costs related to in-licensing and product opportunities, increases in costs related to development of new products and existing products in new indications, and any material issues, delays or failures related to the manufacturing or supply of the Company's products.
Our long-term growth will depend on the successful development and commercialization of new products. Drug development involves a high degree of risk.

The completion of the TYSABRI safety evaluation is also subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the difficulty of analyzing complex data and results, and unanticipated logistical hurdles.
