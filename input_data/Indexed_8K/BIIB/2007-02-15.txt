James Mullen, Biogen Idec's Chief Executive Officer, commented, "In 2006, we built a strong foundation for future growth by executing against three key value drivers for the company. First, we significantly reinvested in the pipeline through partnerships, acquisitions, and strong internal development work, and today we have three compounds in registrational trials. Second, we successfully launched two products: RITUXAN in rheumatoid arthritis and TYSABRI for multiple sclerosis in the U.S. and Europe. With the introduction of a new therapeutic option for treating multiple sclerosis, we have found the MS community increasingly focused on TYSABRI's efficacy. Third, we made these investments while maintaining the core business, growing revenue by 11%, and we are on track to achieve 20% annualized non-GAAP diluted EPS growth for 2003  2007."
Fourth Quarter 2006 Highlights:
Financial Performance
On a non-GAAP basis, Biogen Idec reported net income of $184 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 and $777 million for the full year 2006. Non-GAAP diluted EPS were $0.53 for the fourth quarter of 2006 and $2.25 for the full year 2006.
On a reported basis, calculated in accordance with GAAP, Biogen Idec reported net income of $109 million (or diluted EPS of $0.32) in the fourth quarter of 2006 and net income of $218 million (or diluted EPS of $0.63) for the full year 2006. The reconciling items between GAAP net income and diluted GAAP EPS and adjusted non-GAAP net income and diluted non-GAAP EPS in the fourth quarter, as itemized in Table 3 within this press release, were primarily as follows:

Revenues for the fourth quarter and full year 2006 included $218 million and $811 million, respectively, from Biogen Idec's joint business arrangement related to RITUXAN, a treatment for certain B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) and RA that Biogen Idec co-promotes in the U.S. with Genentech, Inc. All U.S. sales of RITUXAN are recognized by Genentech, and Biogen Idec records its share of the pretax co-promotion profits. U.S. net sales of RITUXAN were $560 million in the fourth quarter (Q4 2005: $484 million) and $2.07 billion for the full year (2005: $1.83 billion), as reported by Genentech.
During the fourth quarter of 2006, Biogen Idec recognized revenue of $18 million related to TYSABRI. This amount is comprised of:
To date, nearly 10,000 patients have been prescribed TYSABRI worldwide. Almost 8,000 patients in the U.S. have enrolled in the TOUCH Program and of these, approximately 5,000 are on therapy. Approximately 1,600 patients internationally have received TYSABRI infusions, primarily in Germany and Sweden.
Revenues from other products in the fourth quarter of 2006 were $7 million (Q4 2005: $16 million). Current revenues now include FUMADERM (fumaric acid esters) obtained in connection with the Fumapharm acquisition. Related revenues in the prior year included AMEVIVE(alefacept), which has since been divested.

Financial Guidance
Biogen Idec today provided guidance for the full year 2007. The Company anticipates for 2007:
Guidance for full year 2007 GAAP diluted EPS is estimated to be in the range of $1.69  $1.84, excluding any future acquisitions or other transactions. In order to reconcile GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance, we have excluded the following items from our non-GAAP EPS guidance provided above:
Because the Company cannot predict with certainty the nature or the amount of non-operating or unusual charges for 2007, we have made no assumption regarding future purchase accounting charges in this GAAP guidance. The Company may incur charges or realize gains in 2007 which could cause actual results to vary from this guidance.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our "non-GAAP net income" and "non-GAAP diluted EPS" financial measures are defined as reported, or GAAP, net income and diluted EPS excluding, for the reasons discussed below, (1) purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments, (2) stock option expense and the cumulative effect of an accounting change relating to the initial adoption of SFAS No. 123R and (3) other items. Our management uses these non-GAAP
 
Page 6 Biogen Idec Reports Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2006 Results
financial measures to establish financial goals and to gain an understanding of the comparative financial performance of the Company from year to year and quarter to quarter. Accordingly, we believe investors' understanding of the Company's financial performance is enhanced as a result of our disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income and diluted EPS.
The Company has reconciled the GAAP net income and diluted EPS for the three-month periods and full years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 to the non-GAAP measures of net income and diluted EPS in Table 3 of this press release.
