Cambridge, MA, July 24, 2007  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB), a global biotechnology leader in the discovery, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of innovative therapies, today reported its second quarter 2007 results.
Second Quarter 2007 Highlights:
 
Page 2 Biogen Idec Reports Second Quarter 2007 Results
"We are quite pleased with our second quarter performance. Fueled by the strong uptake of TYSABRI, we hit a new corporate milestone as our MS franchise exceeded $500 million in quarterly revenue for the first time in Biogen Idec's history. We successfully completed our $3 billion share repurchase while continuing to advance and strengthen our pipeline, particularly with the anticipated addition of the late stage Lixivaptan compound," said James Mullen, Biogen Idec's Chief Executive Officer.
Financial Performance
On a reported basis, calculated in accordance with GAAP, Biogen Idec reported net income of $186 million (or diluted EPS of $0.54) in the second quarter of 2007.
On a non-GAAP basis, Biogen Idec reported net income of $240 million in the second quarter of 2007. Non-GAAP diluted EPS were $0.70 for the second quarter of 2007.
The reconciling items of note between GAAP net income and diluted GAAP EPS and adjusted non-GAAP net income and diluted non-GAAP EPS in the second quarter, as itemized in Table 3 within this press release, were primarily as follows:
Revenue Performance
Revenues from AVONEX, Biogen Idec's therapy for patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), increased 8% in the second quarter to $462 million. U.S. sales increased 3% to $270 million and international sales increased 14% to $192 million.
Revenues for the second quarter 2007 included $231 million from Biogen Idec's joint business arrangement related to RITUXAN, a treatment for certain B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that Biogen Idec co-promotes in the U.S. with Genentech, Inc. All U.S. sales of RITUXAN are recognized by Genentech, and Biogen Idec records its share of the pretax co-promotion profits. U.S. net sales of RITUXAN were $582 million in the second quarter (Q2 2006 were $526 million), as reported by Genentech.
During the second quarter of 2007, Biogen Idec recognized revenue of $48 million related to TYSABRI. This amount is comprised of:

As of mid-July 2007, approximately 14,000 patients are on TYSABRI therapy worldwide in the commercial and clinical trials settings.
Revenue from FUMADERM (fumaric acid esters) in the second quarter of 2007 was $5 million. Biogen Idec did not recognize any revenue in Q1 2007 related to sales of FUMADERM.
Table 4 provides individual product revenues.
Royalties were $23 million and $18 million in the second quarter 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Share Repurchase Program
Biogen Idec did not repurchase any shares in the second quarter 2007 under the 20 million share repurchase program authorized by Biogen Idec's Board of Directors in October 2006.
Financial Guidance
Biogen Idec today increased its guidance for the full year 2007, including:
Full year 2007 GAAP diluted EPS is estimated to be in the range of $1.84 - $1.94 versus $0.63 per share in 2006. This estimate includes the impact of the anticipated Cardiokine deal but excludes any other future acquisitions or transactions. In order to reconcile GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance, we have excluded the following items from our non-GAAP EPS guidance provided above:
 
Page 4 Biogen Idec Reports Second Quarter 2007 Results
Because the Company cannot predict with certainty the nature or the amount of non-operating or unusual charges for 2007, we have made no assumption regarding future purchase accounting charges in this GAAP guidance. The Company may incur charges or realize income in 2007 which could cause actual results to vary from this guidance.
Recent Highlights

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our "non-GAAP net income" and "non-GAAP diluted EPS" financial measures are defined as reported, or GAAP, net income and diluted EPS excluding, for the reasons discussed below, (1) purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments, (2) stock option expense and the cumulative effect of an accounting change relating to the initial adoption of SFAS No. 123R and (3) other items. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to establish financial goals and to gain an understanding of the comparative financial performance of the Company from year to year and quarter to quarter. Accordingly, we believe investors' understanding of the Company's financial performance is enhanced as a result of our disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income and diluted EPS.
Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments  Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS exclude certain purchase accounting impacts such as those related to the merger with Biogen, Inc. (the "Merger") and the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, Conforma Therapeutics Corporation and Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. These include charges for in process research and development and the incremental charge to cost of goods sold from our sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value at the acquisition date. Additionally, these excluded impacts include the incremental charges related to the amortization of the acquired intangible assets. Excluding these charges allows management and investors an alternative view of our financial results "as if" the acquired intangible asset had been developed internally rather than acquired and, therefore, provides a supplemental measure of performance in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
Stock option expense and the cumulative effect of an accounting change relating to the initial adoption of SFAS No. 123R  Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS exclude the impact of
 
Page 6 Biogen Idec Reports Second Quarter 2007 Results
our stock option expense recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 123R and the cumulative effect of an accounting change relating to its initial adoption. We believe that excluding the impact of expensing stock options better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our integrated business. We do include the P&L impact of restricted stock awards and other cash incentives in our non-GAAP results.
Other items  Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS exclude other unusual or non-recurring items that are evaluated on an individual basis. Our evaluation of whether to exclude an item for purposes of determining our non-GAAP financial measures considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including, among other things (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. Items excluded for purposes of determining non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS are severance and restructuring charges and a gain on sale of long-lived assets.
The Company has reconciled the GAAP net income and diluted EPS for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 to the non-GAAP measures of net income and diluted EPS in Table 3 of this press release.
