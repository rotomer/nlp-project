"Our prospects for growth remain strong," said James Mullen, Biogen Idec's Chief Executive Officer. "TYSABRI sales nearly tripled compared to the same period last year, our core products continue to grow, our pipeline is overflowing, and our revenues have grown more than 25 percent year-over-year for three consecutive quarters. Given the strong momentum underway, we are raising our full-year guidance and setting an aspirational goal of generating a record $4 billion in revenues this year."

2008 Full Year Guidance GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments
An itemized reconciliation between projected EPS on a GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis is as follows:
Our "non-GAAP net income" and "non-GAAP diluted EPS" financial measures exclude the following items from GAAP net income and diluted EPS:
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
1.
Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments.
We exclude certain purchase accounting impacts, such as those related to our 2003 merger with Biogen, Inc., the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, Conforma Therapeutics and Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, and the consolidation of Cardiokine and Neurimmune. These include charges for in-process research and development and the incremental charges related to the amortization of the acquired intangible assets. Excluding these charges provides management and investors with a supplemental measure of performance in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
2. Stock option expense recorded in accordance with SFAS 123R.
We believe that excluding the impact of expensing stock options better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our business. We also exclude stock option expense from our non-GAAP R&D expenses and SG&A expenses, but include the P&L impact of restricted stock awards and cash incentives in our non-GAAP results.
3. Unusual or non-recurring items.
We evaluate these on an individual basis, and consider both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.
We believe it is important to share these non-GAAP financial measures with shareholders as they better represent the ongoing economics of the business, reflect how we manage the business internally and set operational goals, and form the basis of our management incentive programs. Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income and diluted EPS.
