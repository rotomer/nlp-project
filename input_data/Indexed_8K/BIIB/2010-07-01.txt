Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
     Biogen Idec Inc. (the "Company") announced on June 30, 2010 that George A. Scangos, Ph.D. has been appointed Chief Executive Officer. Dr. Scangos, age 62, is expected to commence employment with the Company on July 15, 2010. In connection with Dr. Scangos' appointment as Chief Executive Officer, the Board of Directors also appointed Dr. Scangos to the Board of Directors of the Company as a Class 2 director effective on the first day of his employment with the Company. He will fill a current vacancy on the Board of Directors, and his term will expire at the 2011 annual meeting of stockholders. Dr. Scangos is not expected to serve on any committee of the Board of Directors and will receive no compensation for his service on the Board of Directors.
     The Company and Dr. Scangos have entered into an Employment Agreement with an initial term of three years. The Employment Agreement provides that Dr. Scangos will receive a base salary at the annual rate of $1,200,000 and a target bonus opportunity under the Company's annual cash incentive plan equal to 125% of his annual base salary, which will be pro-rated for 2010. Dr. Scangos also will receive a one time sign-on bonus of $500,000 and reimbursement for reasonable and customary relocation expenses actually incurred related to his relocation from California to the Boston area.
     Dr. Scangos also will receive a grant of restricted stock units valued at approximately $3,375,000 and a grant of market stock units valued at approximately $3,375,000. Both grants will be made under the Biogen Idec Inc. 2008 Omnibus Equity Plan on Dr. Scangos' first day of employment with the Company. The number of restricted stock units and market stock units subject to each award will be determined based on the closing price of Biogen Idec common stock on that date.
     If Dr. Scangos' employment is terminated by the Company without "cause" or if he terminates his employment for "good reason" (as such terms are defined in the Employment Agreement), then he will be entitled to a lump sum payment of cash severance in the amount of two times his annual base salary and target annual cash bonus. In addition, he would be entitled to receive a pro rata portion of his annual cash bonus in the year such termination occurs to be based on actual performance or, in the event of termination within two years following a change in control, the target annual cash bonus. All unvested long term incentive awards would be forfeited in accordance with their terms.
     If Dr. Scangos retires from the Company after reaching the age of 65, all of his outstanding and unvested restricted stock units and cash settled performance shares will continue to vest as if Dr. Scangos continued to be employed by the Company.
     A copy of the Employment Agreement is filed with this Form 8-K and attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.
     Dr. Scangos has served as a director and as President and Chief Executive Officer of Exelixis, Inc., a biotechnology company, since October 1996. Since October 2003, Dr. Scangos has served as a member of the board of directors of Anadys Pharmaceuticals, Inc., where he assumed the role of Chairman of the board of directors in December 2005. Dr. Scangos also served as a member of the board of directors of Entelos, Inc., a life sciences company, from 2002 until 2010. From September 1993 to October 1996, Dr. Scangos served as President of Biotechnology at Bayer Corporation, a pharmaceutical company, and was responsible for research, business and process development, manufacturing, engineering and quality assurance. Dr. Scangos also serves as the Chair of the California Healthcare Institute (CHI), and as a member of the Board of the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development. Dr. Scangos is also a member of the Board of Visitors of the University of California, San Francisco School of Pharmacy and the Board of Overseers of the University of California, Davis School of
 
Medicine. Our Board of Directors concluded that Dr. Scangos should serve as a director of Biogen Idec in recognition of his leadership role as the Chief Executive Officer of Biogen Idec. The Board of Directors also considered Dr. Scangos' extensive qualifications, including his training as a scientist, his significant knowledge and experience with respect to the biotechnology, healthcare and pharmaceutical industries, and comprehensive leadership background resulting from service on various boards and as an executive in the pharmaceutical industry.

Acceptance
.
     1.3 The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Executive owes a fiduciary duty of loyalty to the Company to act at all times in the best interest of the Company in a manner consistent with the Executive's position.

     3.5 The Company shall pay or reimburse the Executive for all reasonable expenses actually incurred or paid by the Executive in the performance of the Executive's services to the Company or its Affiliates, subject to and in accordance with applicable expense reimbursement and related policies and procedures as in effect from time to time.

Termination of the Executive's employment, whether by the Company or the Executive, shall not be considered a breach of this
Employment at Will
.
 
Agreement, and the duties of the parties to each other upon and following a termination of employment shall be governed exclusively by this Agreement, or by the terms of the applicable benefit plan.
     4.2 For all purposes related to the Executive's employment by the Company during the Term, the following capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth below:
Certain Definitions
.
          4.2.1 An "Affiliate" of the Company means any corporation or other entity that stands in a relationship to the Company that would result in the Company and such corporation or other entity being treated as a single employer under sections 414(b) or 414(c) of the Code, except that such sections shall be applied by substituting "at least 50%" for "at least 80%" wherever applicable; provided, however, that for purposes of Section 5.2 the term Affiliate shall also include any joint venture or similar entity in which the Company has a material interest.
Affiliate
.
          4.2.2 A termination for "Cause" shall mean termination by the Company of the Executive's employment by reason of the occurrence of any one or more of the following:
Cause
.
               (i) fraud or willful misconduct that has caused or is reasonably expected to result in material injury to the Company or any Affiliate;
               (ii) insubordination with respect to any reasonable and lawful directive from the Board, other than where the Executive reasonably believes in good faith that such insubordination is in the best interests of the Company;
               (iii) malfeasance or non-feasance of duty that has caused or is reasonably expected to result in material injury to the Company or any Affiliate;
               (iv) material breach of this Agreement, or any other agreement between the Executive and the Company or any Affiliate;
               (v) willful and material violation of any generally applicable written policy of the Company previously provided to the Executive, the terms of which provide that violation may be grounds for termination of employment;
               (vi) conduct substantially prejudicial to the business of the Company or an Affiliate, other than where the Executive reasonably believes in good faith that such conduct is in the best interests of the Company; or
               (vii) conviction (including entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere) of the Executive of any felony.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Cause as defined in clauses (i) through (vi) shall not exist unless and until (A) the Executive receives at least thirty days' prior written notice of the Company's intent to terminate the Executive's employment for Cause, which notice specifies in reasonable detail the nature of Cause and, except in the case of Cause as defined in clause (i), the actions required to cure the nature of Cause, if curable, (B) such written notice is received by the Executive within 90 days after the Board learns of the nature of Cause, (C) except in the case of Cause as defined in clause (i), the Executive is given at least thirty days to cure the nature of Cause, if curable, and the nature of Cause remains uncured at the end of such period and (D) such termination is pursuant to a resolution adopted at a meeting of the Board by the affirmative vote of a majority of the independent directors then in office to which the Executive (and the Executive's counsel) shall be invited upon proper notice, and which resolution specifies the specific grounds on which the termination for Cause is based, and which grounds must have been set forth in the
 
original written notice or a subsequent written notice given prior to the meeting; provided that the Executive and his counsel shall be excluded from the Board's deliberations. If the Company notifies the Executive of its intent to terminate his employment for Cause and the Executive subsequently resigns, or if following the Executive's resignation the Company discovers the existence of circumstances that would have constituted Cause, and gives the Executive notice of such circumstances not later than two years after the original Termination Date, the Executive may be considered to have been terminated for Cause by a vote of the Board as in the manner described above.
          4.2.3 A "Change in Control" shall be deemed to have occurred upon the first of the following events:
Change in Control
.
               (i) any Person is or becomes the Beneficial Owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company (not including in the securities beneficially owned by such Person any securities acquired directly from the Company or its subsidiaries) representing fifty percent or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities, excluding any Person who becomes such a Beneficial Owner in connection with a transaction which is a merger or consolidation;
               (ii) the election to the Board, without the recommendation or approval of a majority of the incumbent Board (as determined pursuant to the OEP), of directors constituting a majority of the number of directors of the Company then in office, provided, however, that directors whose election or appointment following the Effective Date is approved by a majority of the members of the incumbent Board shall be deemed to be members of the incumbent Board for purposes hereof, provided further that directors whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest relating to the election of directors of the Company will not be considered as members of the incumbent Board for purposes of this prong (ii); or
               (iii) the occurrence of any other event which a majority of the incumbent Board in its sole discretion determines should be considered a Change in Control under the OEP; provided, however, that a determination by the incumbent Board that an event constitutes a Change in Control under the OEP by itself shall not be construed to entitle the Executive to any of the payments or other benefits provided in this Section 4 prior to an Involuntary Employment Action.
For purposes of this Section 4.2.3, "" shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except that a Person who is properly reporting on Schedule 13G shall not be treated as a Beneficial Owner, and "" shall have the meaning given in section 3(a)(9) of the Exchange Act, as modified and used in sections 13(d) and 14(d) thereof, except that such term shall not include: (A) the Company or any of its Affiliates; (B) a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefits plan of the Company or any of its Affiliates; (C) an underwriter temporarily holding securities pursuant to an offering of such securities or (D) a corporation or other business entity owned, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company for purposes of the OEP.

Corporate Transaction
.
               (i) a consolidation, merger or similar transaction or series of related transactions, including a sale or other disposition of stock, in which the Company (or an Affiliate) is not the surviving corporation or which results in the acquisition of all or substantially all of the then outstanding Common Stock by a single person or entity or by a group of persons and/or entities acting in concert;
               (ii) a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the Company's assets; or
 
               (iii) a dissolution or liquidation of the Company.
Where a Corporate Transaction involves a tender offer that is reasonably expected to be followed by a merger described in clause (i) as determined by the Committee, the Corporate Transaction shall be deemed to have occurred upon consummation of the tender offer.
          4.2.5 An "Involuntary Employment Action" means the termination of the Executive's employment by the Company without Cause or a resignation by the Executive upon the occurrence of any of the following circumstances:
Involuntary Employment Action
.
               (i) any material adverse alteration and/or material diminution in the Executive's authority, duties or responsibilities, including a requirement that the Executive report to anyone other than the Board, provided that the failure of the Company's stockholders to elect or re-elect the Executive to the Board shall not be considered an Involuntary Employment Action;
               (ii) a reduction of the Base Salary except as permitted herein, or a material reduction in Annual Bonus Target;
               (iii) relocation of the offices at which the Executive is employed which increases the distance between the Executive's residence and such offices by more than 100 miles on a round trip basis; or
               (iv) a material breach by the Company of any provision of this Agreement or any other agreement between the Executive and the Company or an Affiliate.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a resignation by the Executive shall not be considered an Involuntary Employment Action unless the Executive notifies the Chief Legal Officer or the Head of Human Resources of the Company in writing of the basis for his resignation within 90 days after he becomes aware of the existence of the facts or circumstances constituting an Involuntary Employment Action. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances constituting the Involuntary Employment Action event and shall provide the Company with thirty days to cure such condition, and if the Company cures such facts or circumstances to the Executive's reasonable satisfaction within such 30 day period a subsequent resignation by the Executive based on such facts or circumstances shall not constitute an Involuntary Employment Action, unless such facts or circumstances recur in which event a new notice shall be given as provided above. The notice also shall specify the date the Executive's termination of employment is to become effective, which date shall be at least 30 days and not more than 90 days after the date the notice is given; provided, however, that after receiving such notice, the Company shall be permitted to terminate the Executive's employment prior to the specified termination date, which termination shall constitute an Involuntary Employment Action. For avoidance of doubt, a termination of the Executive's employment upon the expiration of the Term or thereafter following a notice of non-renewal given by either party shall not constitute an Involuntary Employment Action.
     4.3
