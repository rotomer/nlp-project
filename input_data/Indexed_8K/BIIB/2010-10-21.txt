     On October 19, 2010, Biogen Idec Inc. and Genentech, Inc., a wholly owned member of the Roche Group, amended and restated their Amended and Restated Collaboration Agreement dated June 19, 2003 with regard to the development of ocrelizumab, a humanized anti-CD20 antibody, and agreed to terms for the development of GA101, a next-generation anti-CD20 antibody, as summarized below.
     
Ocrelizumab
     Genentech will have responsibility for the further development and commercialization of ocrelizumab in multiple sclerosis and will fund all of the related costs going forward. Biogen Idec will be entitled to receive tiered royalties between 13.5% and 24% on U.S. sales of ocrelizumab. Commercialization of ocrelizumab will not impact Biogen Idec's percentage of the co-promotion profits for RITUXAN (rituximab).
     
GA101
     Biogen Idec will increase its share of the losses and profits related to the development and commercialization of GA101 in the U.S. Biogen Idec will pay 35% of the development and commercialization expenses of GA101 and will receive between 35% and 39% of the profits of GA101 based upon the achievement of certain sales milestones. To date, Biogen Idec had paid 30% of the GA101 development expenses. Biogen Idec will pay approximately $10 million to compensate Genentech for Biogen Idec's increased share of such previously incurred expenses. Commercialization of GA101 will impact Biogen Idec's percentage of the co-promotion profits for RITUXAN, as summarized in the table below.
     
RITUXAN
     Biogen Idec's current pretax co-promotion profit-sharing formula, which resets annually, provides for a 30% share of the first $50 million of co-promotion operating profits for RITUXAN in the U.S. and Canada and a 40% share of such profits in excess of $50 million. Biogen Idec's share of the co-promotion profits for RITUXAN will change, as summarized in the table below, upon the following events:
