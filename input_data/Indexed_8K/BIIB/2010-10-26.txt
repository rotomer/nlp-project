FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Weston, MA, October 26, 2010  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB), a global biotechnology leader in the discovery, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of innovative therapies, today announced its third quarter 2010 results.
Third Quarter 2010 Highlights
 
Page 2 Biogen Idec Reports Third Quarter 2010 Results
As of September 30, 2010, Biogen Idec had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $1.4 billion.
"We had another solid quarter driven primarily by increased AVONEX and TYSABRI revenues," said George A. Scangos, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer, Biogen Idec, "We also continued to demonstrate our leadership position in MS with our strong showing at this year's ECTRIMS Congress, while expanding our neurology foothold with the licensing agreement for KNS-760704 (dexpramipexole) for the treatment of ALS."
Progress on TYSABRI Risk Stratification
The company also announced that it and its partner, Elan Corporation, plc, have made substantial progress on TYSABRI risk stratification efforts. Data presented at the 26th Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) further supported the potential clinical utility of an investigational assay that detects anti-JC virus (JCV) antibodies in human plasma or serum. The detection of anti-JCV antibodies may provide a means to segment, or stratify, multiple sclerosis (MS) patients considering or receiving treatment with TYSABRI and assess their risk for developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare, but serious, brain infection. The companies have also completed preliminary discussions with regulators in the US and Europe about these data and plan to submit labeling changes to both agencies by the first quarter of 2011.
Other Products and Royalties
Revenues from other products in the third quarter of 2010 were $12 million compared to $15 million in the third quarter of 2009.

Royalty revenues were $36 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared to $35 million in the third quarter of 2009.

Share Repurchase Programs
In April 2010, the Board approved a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. During the third quarter of 2010, Biogen Idec completed the program by repurchasing and retiring 9 million shares at a total cost of $468 million. In total, since the beginning of the year, Biogen Idec has purchased 40.3 million shares for a total cost of approximately $2.1 billion. Biogen Idec's fully-diluted weighted average shares outstanding were approximately 242 million for the third quarter.
TYSABRI Patient Growth
Based upon data available to Biogen Idec through the TOUCH prescribing program and other third-party sources, Biogen Idec estimates that as of the end of September 2010 approximately 55,100 patients were on commercial and clinical TYSABRI therapy worldwide, and that cumulatively approximately 75,500 patients have ever been treated with TYSABRI in the post-marketing setting.

An itemized reconciliation between net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. on a GAAP basis and net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. on a non-GAAP basis is as follows:
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our "non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc." and "non-GAAP diluted EPS" financial measures exclude the following items from GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS:
1. Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments.
We exclude certain purchase accounting impacts, such as those related to the 2003 merger between Biogen, Inc. and Idec Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, Conforma Therapeutics and Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, and the consolidation of Knopp, Cardiokine and Neurimmune. These include charges for in-process research and development and the incremental charges related to the amortization of the acquired intangible assets. Excluding these charges provides management and investors with a supplemental measure of performance in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
2. Stock option expense recorded in accordance with the accounting standard for share-based payments.
We believe that excluding the impact of expensing stock options better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our business. We exclude stock option expense from our non-GAAP R&D expenses and SG&A expenses, but include the P&L impact of restricted stock grants and cash incentives in our non-GAAP results.
3. Unusual or non-recurring items.
We evaluate these on an individual basis, and consider both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.
We believe it is important to share these non-GAAP financial measures with shareholders as they better represent the ongoing economics of the business, reflect how we manage the business internally and set operational goals, and form the basis of our management incentive programs. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS.
