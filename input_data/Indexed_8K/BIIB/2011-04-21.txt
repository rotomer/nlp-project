FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Weston, MA, April 21, 2011  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB), a global biotechnology leader in the discovery, development, manufacturing and commercialization of innovative therapies, today announced its first quarter 2011 results.
First Quarter 2011 Highlights:
 
As of March 31, 2011, Biogen Idec had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $2.1 billion.
"We had a very solid first quarter based on the performance of our three blockbuster products," said George A. Scangos, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Biogen Idec. "We continued our transformation into a lean, aggressive and focused company, and the reinvigoration of Research and Development is well underway. We met several exciting pipeline milestones, including the positive Phase III data read-out from the DEFINE trial for BG-12, our oral MS drug candidate, and the enrollment of the first patient in our Phase III EMPOWER trial for dexpramipexole, a potential treatment for ALS. We continue to unlock TYSABRI's potential through cutting edge science and are encouraged by the CHMP's positive opinion to include anti-JC virus antibody status as an additional risk factor for PML in the TYSABRI label. With these successes, we look forward to continue to drive our core business and advance our deep late-stage pipeline."
Share Repurchases
During the first quarter of 2011, Biogen Idec repurchased 2.8 million shares of stock at a total cost of $195 million.
TYSABRI Patient Growth
Based upon data available to us through the TOUCH prescribing program and other third-party sources, as of the end of March 2011, we estimate that approximately 58,400 patients were on commercial and clinical TYSABRI therapy worldwide, and that cumulatively approximately 83,300 patients have ever been treated with TYSABRI in the post-marketing setting.
Other Products and Royalties
Revenues from other products in the first quarter of 2011 were $13 million, the same as in the first quarter of 2010.
Table 4 provides individual product revenues.
Royalties were $26 million in the first quarter of 2011, the same as in the first quarter of 2010.

An itemized reconciliation between net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. on a GAAP basis and net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. on a non-GAAP basis is as follows:
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our "non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc." and "non-GAAP diluted EPS" financial measures exclude the following items from GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS:
.
1. Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments
We exclude certain purchase accounting impacts, such as those related to the 2003 merger between Biogen, Inc. and Idec Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, and Panima Pharmaceuticals AG and the consolidation of Knopp, Cardiokine and Neurimmune. These include charges for in-process research and development and amortization of the acquired intangible assets. Excluding these charges provides management and investors with a supplemental measure of performance in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
.
2. Stock option expense recorded in accordance with the accounting standard for share-based payments
We believe that excluding the impact of expensing stock options better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our business. We exclude stock option expense from our non-GAAP R&D expenses and SG&A expenses, but include the P&L impact of all other share-based awards and cash incentives in our non-GAAP results.
.
3. Unusual or non-recurring items
We evaluate these on an individual basis, and consider both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.
We believe it is important to share these non-GAAP financial measures with shareholders as they better represent the ongoing economics of the business, reflect how we manage the business internally and set operational goals, and form the basis of our management incentive programs. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS.
