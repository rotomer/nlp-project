Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
          On June 1, 2011, the Board of Directors approved the form of indemnification agreement for the directors and executive officers of Biogen Idec Inc. (the "Company"). Each of the Company's directors and executive officers will execute this indemnification agreement, which will supersede any pre-existing indemnification agreements. Under the form of indemnification agreement:
The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of indemnification agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
          At the 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 2, 2011, stockholders approved an amendment to Article VII of the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (Charter Amendment) that declassified the Board of Directors and instituted annual voting for each director beginning with the 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Upon stockholder approval of the Charter Amendment, conforming amendments to the Company's Second Amended and Restated Bylaws (Bylaws) became effective as well. These Bylaw amendments removed references to a classified Board in Sections 2.2, 3.1 and 3.2, and reflect stockholders' ability under Delaware General Corporation Law Section 141(k) to remove directors on a declassified Board with or without cause in Section 3.3.
          On June 1, 2011, the Board of Directors added a new Section 8.8 to the Bylaws to establish the Delaware Court of Chancery as the exclusive forum for resolving derivative actions and claims alleging a violation of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, or breach of fiduciary duties or other violation of Delaware decisional law relating to the internal affairs of the Company.
          The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copy of the Charter Amendment and Bylaw amendments, which are filed as Exhibit 3.1 and Exhibit 3.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Item 5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
          At the 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 2, 2011, the final voting results were as follows:

     The exhibits listed on the Exhibit Index immediately preceding such exhibits are filed as part of this Current Report on Form 8-K.
