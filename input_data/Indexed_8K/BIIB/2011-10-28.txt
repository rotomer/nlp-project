Weston, MA, October 28, 2011  Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB), a global biotechnology leader in the discovery, development, manufacturing and commercialization of innovative therapies, today announced its third quarter 2011 results.
Third Quarter 2011 Highlights:
 
As of September 30, 2011, Biogen Idec had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $2.9 billion.
"This has been a quarter of tremendous accomplishments for Biogen Idec," said George A. Scangos, Ph.D., the company's chief executive officer. "We continued to deliver strong product and financial performance driven by the growth of TYSABRI. The recent positive data readout from the CONFIRM trial of BG-12 is a truly meaningful development for our company and for multiple sclerosis patients, and we are thrilled by it. We now have strong results for BG-12 in two large and robust clinical trials and we anticipate filing for approval in the first half of next year with the intent of bringing this potentially major new therapy to MS patients as soon as possible. We continue to improve the quality of our pipeline by concentrating on cutting-edge science with the greatest potential to help patients and drive growth, and we are focused on excellence in execution as we prepare for the potential of multiple product launches in coming years."
TYSABRI Patient Growth
Based upon data available to us through the TOUCH prescribing program and other third-party sources, as of the end of September 2011, we estimate that approximately 63,500 patients were on commercial and clinical TYSABRI therapy worldwide, and that cumulatively approximately 92,200 patients have ever been treated with TYSABRI in the post-marketing setting.
Other Products and Royalties
Revenues from other products in the third quarter of 2011 were $17 million, compared to $12 million in the third quarter of 2010.

2011 Full Year Guidance GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments
An itemized reconciliation between projected EPS on a GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis is as follows:
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our "non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc." and "non-GAAP diluted EPS" financial measures exclude the following items from GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS:
1. Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments.
We exclude certain purchase accounting impacts, such as those related to the 2003 merger between Biogen, Inc. and Idec Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, Conforma Therapeutics, Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, and Panima Pharmaceuticals AG and the consolidation of Knopp and Cardiokine. These include charges for in-process research and development and amortization of the acquired intangible assets. Excluding these charges provides management and investors with a supplemental measure of performance in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
2. Stock option expense recorded in accordance with the accounting standard for share-based payments.
We believe that excluding the impact of expensing stock options better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our business. We exclude stock option expense from our non-GAAP R&D expenses and SG&A expenses, but include the impact of all other share-based awards and cash incentives in our non-GAAP results.
3. Other items.
We evaluate these on an individual basis, and consider both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.
We believe it is important to share these non-GAAP financial measures with shareholders as they better represent the ongoing economics of the business, reflect how we manage the business internally and set operational goals, and form the basis of our management incentive programs. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. and diluted EPS.
