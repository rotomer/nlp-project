Item 8.01 Other Events
Biogen Idec Inc. has received antitrust clearance from the U.S. Government under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act for its previously announced collaboration with Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to develop and commercialize novel oral Syk inhibitors for the treatment of various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Biogen Idec's agreement with Portola is now effective and Biogen Idec will pay Portola $36 million in cash and will purchase $9 million of Portola equity before the end of the year. Under the terms of its collaboration and license agreement, Biogen Idec may also make additional payments of up to $508.5 million based on the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. Biogen Idec will lead the global development and commercialization efforts for the Syk inhibitor program in major indications such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, while Portola will lead worldwide development and U.S. commercialization efforts for select smaller indications as well as discovery efforts for follow-on Syk inhibitors. Portola retains an option to co-promote alongside Biogen Idec in the United States in major indications. Worldwide costs and profits will be split by Biogen Idec and Portola 75 percent and 25 percent, respectively.
