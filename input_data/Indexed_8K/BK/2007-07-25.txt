On July 19, 2007, the Registrant conducted a conference call and webcast with respect to results of operations for second quarter 2007 for The Bank of New York Company, Inc. ("BNY") and Mellon Financial Corporation ("MFC"). BNY and MFC merged with the Registrant on July 1, 2007, with the Registrant being the surviving entity. In conjunction with the conference call and webcast, the Registrant made available on its website, beginning on July 19, 2007, a Quarterly Earnings Summary. The Quarterly Earnings Summary is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this report, is "furnished" pursuant to General Instruction B.2. of Form 8-K, is not "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is not incorporated by reference into any filings the Registrant has made or may make under the Securities Act of 1933.
 
Exhibit 99.1 to this report contains information which may be considered to constitute "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K. The Registrant's management believes that these measures are useful to the investment community in analyzing the financial results and trends of ongoing operations. Management believes that they facilitate comparisons with prior periods and reflect the principal basis on which management monitors financial performance. Management also believes this presentation allows investors to more appropriately evaluate the impact of revenues from both taxable and tax-exempt sources.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
All narrative comparisons in this Quarterly Earnings Summary are with the second quarter of 2006 and all information is reported on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise noted.
This Quarterly Earnings Summary has been designed to facilitate the understanding of the impact of the merger between The Bank of New York and Mellon which closed subsequent to the end of the second quarter on July 1, 2007. Throughout this Quarterly Earnings Summary, certain measures, which are noted, exclude certain items. We believe these measures are useful to the investment community in analyzing the financial results and trends of ongoing operations. We believe they facilitate comparisons with prior periods and reflect the principal basis on which our management monitors financial performance. Supplemental combined financial results for The Bank of New York Mellon exclude the impact of historical intangible amortization and the pro forma impact of incremental purchase accounting intangibles resulting from the merger.

Investment income - return on seed capital investments
We often invest in our asset management products during the start-up phase of the investments. These investments provide sufficient capital for new products to achieve their stated investment objectives. During the second quarter, The Bank of New York and Mellon's seed capital gains (losses) previously recorded in foreign exchange and other trading activities revenue were reclassified to investment income. This classification better characterizes the revenue relative to the nature of the investments. The impact of the reclassification from foreign exchange and other trading revenue to investment income on Mellon was a decrease of $6 million in the 2Q06 and increases of $3 million in the 3Q06, $14 million in the 4Q06, $5 million in the 1Q07 and $4 million for the first six months of 2006. The impact of the reclassification to investment income on The Bank of New York resulted in no change in the 2Q06, and increases of $1 million in the 3Q06, $2 million in the 4Q06, $1 million in the 1Q07 and $2 million for the first six months of 2006. All prior period amounts have been reclassified and did not affect the results of operations.
Merger and integration expense
Effective with the current disclosure, Mellon's merger and integration charges are reported as a separate line item. In previous disclosures, Mellon reported merger and integration charges in various noninterest expense categories. The impact of the change was to reduce previously reported staff and professional, legal and other purchased services expense for Mellon.
