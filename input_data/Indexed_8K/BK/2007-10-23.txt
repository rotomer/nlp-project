Exhibit 99.1
 
All narrative comparisons in this Quarterly Earnings Summary are with the third quarter of 2006 and all information is reported on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise noted.
This Quarterly Earnings Summary has been designed to facilitate the understanding of the impact of the merger between The Bank of New York and Mellon, which closed on July 1, 2007. Throughout this Quarterly Earnings Summary, certain measures, which are noted, exclude certain items. We believe these measures are useful to the investment community in analyzing the financial results and trends of ongoing operations. We believe they facilitate comparisons with prior periods and reflect the principal basis on which our management monitors financial performance. Pro-forma combined financial results for The Bank of New York Mellon prior to the consummation of the merger exclude the impact of intangible amortization and the pro forma impact of incremental purchase accounting intangibles resulting from the merger.
 
 
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT
A number of statements (i) in this Quarterly Earnings Summary, (ii) in our presentations and (iii) in the responses to questions are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements, which may be expressed in a variety of ways, including the use of future or present tense language, relate to, among other things, the Corporation's future financial goals, including future revenue, expenses and earnings, new business wins, and pipelines for new business and statements with respect to the merger integration; including revenue synergies, expense synergy targets, estimated merger and integration charges, completion date for the bank consolidation, integration completion date and sources of revenue enhancements; as well as BNY Mellon's overall plans, strategies, goals, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions, and are based on assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties and that are subject to change based on various important factors (some of which are beyond BNY Mellon's control). Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of these risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the businesses of Mellon and The Bank of New York may not be integrated successfully or the integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; the combined company may not realize, to the extent or at the time we expect, revenue synergies and cost savings from the transaction; service quality metrics in Asset Servicing may not be attained; revenue following the transaction may be lower than expected as a result of losses of customers or other reasons; deposit attrition, operating costs, customer loss and business disruption following the transaction, including, without limitation, difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, may be greater than expected; changes in political and economic conditions; changes in the relevant benchmark to measure changes in investment management fees; equity, fixed-income and foreign exchange market fluctuations; changes in the mix of assets under management; changes in the mix of deposits; the price of oil; the effects of the adoption of new accounting standards; corporate and personal customers' bankruptcies; market volatility; operational risk; inflation; levels of tax-free income; technological change; success in the timely development of new products and services; competitive product and pricing pressures within the Corporation's markets; consumer spending and savings habits; interest rate fluctuations; geographic sources of income; monetary fluctuations; acquisitions and integrations of acquired businesses; changes in law; changes in fiscal, monetary, regulatory, trade and tax policies and laws; success in gaining regulatory approvals when required; the effects of terrorist acts and the results of the war on terrorism; as well as other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in the filings of the Corporation with the SEC and in The Bank of New York's and Mellon's historical reports (such as Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K) filed with the SEC. Such forward-looking statements speak only as of Oct. 18, 2007, and BNY Mellon undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after that date or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
The results prior to the consummation of the merger on July 1, 2007, reflect the sum of The Bank of New York and Mellon's historical results, but do not include the pro forma impact of purchase accounting adjustments. The business sector combined results for all periods reflect actions taken to report consistent transfer pricing and cost allocation methodologies as well as intercompany eliminations between The Bank of New York and Mellon. As a result of actions taken in the third quarter of 2007, the business sector results for 2006 have been changed from the second quarter of 2007 Combined Quarterly Earnings Summary to reflect consistent reporting.

SUMMARY OF NON-OPERATING ITEMS
 
 
Supplemental information - Earnings Per Share Presented on a GAAP and Non-GAAP basis
In the merger transaction between The Bank of New York and Mellon, The Bank of New York shareholders received .9434 shares of The Bank of New York Mellon common stock for each share of The Bank of New York common stock outstanding on the closing date of the merger. Mellon shareholders received one share of The Bank of New York Mellon common stock for each share of Mellon Financial Corp. common stock outstanding on the closing date of the merger. Historical earnings per share for The Bank of New York are presented in post-merger share count terms in this Quarterly Earnings Summary and the Earnings Release. The table below converts earnings per share for The Bank of New York into post-merger share count terms, for periods prior to July 1, 2007.
Reported amounts are presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that this supplemental non-GAAP information is useful to the investment community in analyzing the financial results and trends of our business. We believe they facilitate comparisons with prior periods and reflect the principal basis on which our management internally monitors financial performance. These non-GAAP items also are excluded from our segment measures used internally to evaluate segment performance in accordance with GAAP because management does not consider them particularly relevant or useful in evaluating the operating performance of our business segments.
