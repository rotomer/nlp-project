Exhibit 99.1
 
 
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) reported fourth quarter income from continuing operations, before extraordinary items, of $700 million and diluted earnings per share of 61 cents, which compares to 60 cents a year ago and 56 cents sequentially. Income from continuing operations was $642 million in the third quarter of 2007, and $427 million in the fourth quarter of 2006.
NEW YORK, January 17, 2008 
Adjusting for the impact of merger and integration expense ($124 million pre-tax), diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2007 were 67 cents, which compares to 61 cents a year ago and 67 cents sequentially. The results of continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2007 include 10 cents per share for the CDO write-down.
"I am pleased with our accomplishments in 2007. We began to successfully merge our two legacy companies and posted terrific fourth quarter results with 17% revenue and 26% earnings per share growth, excluding the CDO write-down. We are fully delivering on our commitments to clients, shareholders, and employees and business momentum remains strong. Our fourth quarter results also include the relative impact of recent market volatility on a small portion of our investment securities portfolio as well as our proactive decision to consolidate a bank-sponsored conduit. These actions are consistent with our strategy of aggressively reducing risk and complexity while exiting those businesses that do not support our global growth opportunities in asset management and securities servicing," said Robert P. Kelly, chief executive officer of The Bank of New York Mellon.
Net income totaled $520 million, or 45 cents per share, in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared with $1.625 billion or $2.27 per share in the fourth quarter of 2006. The fourth quarter of 2007 included an extraordinary charge of $180 million, net of tax, associated with management's decision to restructure and consolidate the assets of the bank-sponsored conduit, Three Rivers Funding Corporation (TRFC). This decision was based on the ongoing disruption in the capital markets impacting the funding costs of conduits which is in sharp contrast to the current level of our own funding costs, together with our continuing efforts to exit non-core activities. The extraordinary loss reflects the impact of a negative mark to market associated with spread widening on the assets consolidated. The securities within this portfolio have strong investment grade ratings and there were no downgrades of TRFC's assets during the fourth quarter. We expect to earn back the mark to market loss over the remaining lives of the assets (which average approximately 4-5 years), based on the credit quality of the assets. Further discussion of the assets consolidated and the related financial impact is provided on page 9.

Income from continuing operations, before extraordinary loss, for the full-year 2007 totaled $2.227 billion, or $2.38 per share, compared with $1.476 billion, or $2.04 per share, in 2006. Adjusting for the impact of merger and integration expense ($404 million pre-tax), and non-operating items detailed on page 11, diluted earnings per share for full-year 2007 were $2.62, compared with $2.14 for full-year 2006. Adjusting for the impact of merger and integration expenses ($404 million pre-tax), intangible amortization ($319 million pre-tax) and non-operating items, diluted earnings per share for full-year 2007 were $2.83 which compares with $2.22 for full-year 2006. Net income for the full-year 2007 totaled $2.039 billion, or $2.18 per share, compared with $2.847 billion, or $3.94 per share, for full-year 2006. Discontinued operations for the fourth quarter and full-year 2006 included a net after-tax gain of $1.217 billion from the sale of our Retail Business.
(Unless otherwise noted, all comments begin with the results of the fourth quarter of 2007. This is followed by commentary that compares the current period to pro forma combined results of the fourth quarter of 2006 unless otherwise noted. The appendix to this release provides the pro forma combined results, without purchase accounting adjustments and assumes that the merger had occurred at the beginning of the third quarter of 2006. Please refer to the Quarterly Earnings Summary Report for detailed business sector information.)

Excluding merger and integration expense, intangible amortization, and non-operating items in the fourth quarter of 2006, detailed in the Quarterly Earnings Summary Report, noninterest expense on a pro forma combined basis increased 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. The results reflect $96 million in expense synergies associated with the merger detailed in the Quarterly Earnings Summary Report.
On a pro forma combined basis, excluding merger and integration expense, intangible amortization expense, the CDO write-down, and non-operating items in the fourth quarter of 2006 and third quarter of 2007 (detailed in the Quarterly Earnings Summary), we generated 1,050 bps of positive operating leverage compared to the prior year and 350 bps sequentially.

Earnings Release Format
Results for the fourth and third quarters of 2007 reflect The Bank of New York and Mellon on a consolidated basis. The results for the 12 months ended December 31, 2007 in this release include 12 months of The Bank of New York and six months for Mellon, which reflect all related purchase accounting adjustments. All periods prior to July 1, 2007 reflect financial results for The Bank of New York only, unless labeled pro forma.
Throughout this earnings release, all information is reported on a continuing operations basis, before extraordinary (loss), unless otherwise noted. Quarterly returns are annualized. Certain amounts are presented on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis. We believe that this presentation provides comparability of amounts arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources, and is consistent with industry practice. The adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income. Where financial measures are presented excluding certain specified amounts, we believe the presentation enhances investor understanding of period-to-period results.

Securities Available for Sale
At Dec. 31, 2007, investment securities totaled $48.7 billion. As of that date, our mortgage and asset-backed securities portfolio of $41.6 billion (excluding TRFC securities) were rated 96% AAA, 3% AA and 1% A. Included in this portfolio were $379 million of collateralized debt obligations (CDO), at par, that contained subprime exposure. Based on deteriorating conditions in the U.S. housing market, we recognized a pre-tax loss of $200 million ($118 million after-tax) for other than temporary impairment related to these securities. The $179 million carrying value of the CDOs at Dec. 31, 2007 was 47% of par.
In the third quarter of 2007, we acquired $375 million of asset-backed securities in a structured investment vehicle (SIV) from a portfolio advised by one of our asset managers. During the fourth quarter of 2007, $75 million of these securities matured and we sold $174 million of these securities,resulting in a pre-tax loss of $8 million. We applied a similar discount to the $126 million of remaining securities resulting in a write-down of $6 million. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we acquired additional SIV securities with a fair market value of $45 million from affiliated funds. The $165 million carrying amount of remaining SIV securities at Dec. 31, 2007 was 88% of par.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2007, we sold other investment securities available for sale, recognizing a pre-tax gain of $23 million.
As of Dec. 31, 2007, within our investment securities portfolio, our mortgage-backed securities with subprime exposure were $1.5 billion (excluding TRFC securities) and asset-backed collateralized debt obligations as described above were $179 million. Ratings on these securities are below:
 
The unrealized net of tax loss on our securities available for sale was $339 million as of Dec. 31, 2007, compared with $250 million at Sept. 30, 2007. At Dec. 31, 2006, the gains and losses on securities available for sale netted to zero.
Nonperforming Loans
Nonperforming loans were $186 million at Dec. 31, 2007, up from $37 million at Dec. 31, 2006 and up from $35 million at Sept. 30, 2007. The increase relates principally to liquidity facilities to two SIVs ($81 million), a related party loan provided to support an investment management product that is currently being unwound and various smaller loans. The SIV exposure added to nonperforming loans represents all of the SIV exposure within our loan portfolio.
Provision and Reserve for Credit Exposure
The provision for credit losses totaled $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared with a credit of $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 and no provision in the third quarter of 2007. In the third quarter of 2007, there was no net provision which was made possible in part by a $15 million release of reserves from the sale of leases. The reserve for loan losses was $327 million at Dec 31, 2007, $332 million at Sept. 30, 2007 and $287 million at Dec. 31, 2006. The reserve for unfunded commitments was $167 million at Dec. 31, 2007, $178 million at Sept. 30, 2007 and $150 million at Dec. 31, 2006.

Consolidation of Three Rivers Funding Corporation (TRFC)
On Dec. 31, 2007 we called the first loss notes of TRFC, making us the primary beneficiary and triggering the consolidation of TRFC. If we had not called the first loss notes, TRFC would not have been consolidated under FIN46R. The consolidation resulted in the recognition of an extraordinary loss (non-cash accounting charge) of $180 million after-tax, or 16 cents per share, representing the current mark to market discount from par associated with spread widening for the assets in TRFC.
Strategically TRFC is not core to our focus on high growth global opportunities in Asset Management and Securities Servicing; it had an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial results, generating only $1 million in fee revenue in the third quarter of 2007. Furthermore, the continuing disruption in the capital markets negatively impacted TRFC funding costs and related returns, which was in sharp contrast to our funding costs and balance sheet strength. This consolidation improves the profitability of this portfolio and eliminates a management distraction.
In addition to the extraordinary loss, the size of the 2007 year-end balance sheet increased by the full amount of third party funding, approximately $4.0 billion. At Dec 31, 2007, we held the remaining funding of $136 million. Our primary capital ratios were affected as follows by the consolidation:
 
Prospectively, based on our excess liquidity, the third party funding for TRFC will be eliminated over the course of the first quarter of 2008, resulting in an expected improvement in our adjusted tangible common equity ratio of approximately 10 bps during the first quarter of 2008.
Also prospectively, the $180 million after-tax mark to market on the TRFC assets is expected to be accreted into income over the remaining lives of the assets, which are projected to average approximately 4-5 years, based on the credit quality of the assets.
The fair value of TRFC's asset-backed securities portfolio totaled approximately $3.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2007. In addition to these securities, TRFC has approximately $400 million of securitizations of client receivables that are structured to meet a credit rating of A. Below are TRFC's asset and mortgage-backed securities by credit rating.
 
We will integrate these securities into our investment securities portfolio in the first quarter of 2008.
Consolidated Net Income Including Discontinued Operations
Net income, including discontinued operations, totaled $520 million, or 45 cents per share, in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared with $1.625 billion, or $2.27 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2006, and $640 million, or 56 cents per share, in the third quarter of 2007. Discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2006 included a net after-tax gain of $1.217 billion from the sale of our Retail Business.

Supplemental InformationReconciliation of Earnings Per Share  GAAP to Non-GAAP
Reported amounts are presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that this supplemental non-GAAP information is useful to the investment community in analyzing the financial results and trends of our business. We believe they facilitate comparisons with prior periods and reflect the principal basis on which our management internally monitors financial performance. These non-GAAP items also are excluded from our segment measures used internally to evaluate segment performance because management does not consider them particularly relevant or useful in evaluating the operating performance of our business segments.
