Exhibit 99.1
 
All narrative comparisons in this Quarterly Earnings Summary are with the first quarter of 2007 and all information is reported on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise noted.
Throughout this Quarterly Earnings Summary, certain measures, which are noted, exclude certain items, including the impact of the extraordinary item in 4Q07. We believe these measures are useful to the investment community in analyzing the financial results and trends of ongoing operations. We believe they facilitate comparisons with prior periods and they reflect the principal basis on which our management internally monitors financial performance. These items are also excluded from our segment measures used internally to evaluate segment performance because management does not consider them particularly relevant or useful in evaluating the operating performance of our business segments. Pro forma combined financial results for The Bank of New York Mellon prior to the consummation of the merger exclude the pro forma impact of incremental purchase accounting including intangible amortization resulting from the merger.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT
A number of statements (i) in this Quarterly Earnings Summary, (ii) in our presentations and (iii) in the responses to questions are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements, which may be expressed in a variety of ways, including the use of future or present tense language, relate to, among other things, the Corporation's future financial goals, including future revenue, expenses and earnings, new business wins, and pipelines for new business; ability and intention to hold certain securities; possible future activities relating to further capital support agreements; statements with respect to the merger integration, including revenue synergies and targeted run rates, expense synergy targets and estimated merger and integration charges; anticipated completion date for the bank consolidation; and impact and anticipated closing date of sale of Mellon 1
st
Business Bank; as well as BNY Mellon's overall plans, strategies, goals, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions, and are based on assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors (some of which are beyond BNY Mellon's control). Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of these risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the businesses of Mellon and The Bank of New York may not be integrated successfully or the integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; the combined company may not realize, to the extent or at the time we expect, revenue synergies and cost savings from the transaction; service quality metrics in Asset Servicing may not be attained; revenue following the merger may be lower than expected as a result of losses of customers or other reasons; deposit attrition, operating costs, customer loss and business disruption following the merger, including, without limitation, difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, may be greater than expected; as well as the risk factors and other uncertainties set forth in BNY Mellon's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 and BNY Mellon's other filings with the SEC. Such forward-looking statements speak only as of April 17, 2008 and BNY Mellon undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after that date or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
The results prior to the consummation of the merger on July 1, 2007, reflect the sum of The Bank of New York and Mellon's historical results, but do not include the pro forma impact of purchase accounting adjustments. The business segment combined results for all periods reflect actions taken to report consistent transfer pricing and cost allocation methodologies as well as intercompany eliminations between The Bank of New York and Mellon.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO
At March 31, 2008, investment securities totaled $45.5 billion, which consists of our core portfolio of $42.6 billion and Three Rivers Funding Corp.'s ("TRFC") portfolio of $2.9 billion. The unrealized net of tax loss on our total securities available for sale portfolio was $1.789 billion at March 31, 2008, which was comprised of $1.523 billion in our core portfolio and $266 million in our TRFC portfolio. The unrealized net of tax loss at Dec. 31, 2007 was $342 million and related entirely to our core portfolio. The increase in the unrealized loss in the first quarter of 2008 compared with the fourth quarter of 2007 was due to spread widening in the fixed income and asset-backed securities markets.
At March 31, 2008, the unrealized loss on our securities available for sale portfolio decreased our adjusted tangible common equity ratio by 90 basis points. Significant dislocation continued in the credit markets, particularly late in the first quarter of 2008. Spreads continued to widen appreciably as there were forced liquidations in the asset and mortgage-backed securities markets. That said, our core asset and mortgage-backed securities portfolio continued to remain highly rated, with 95% of our securities rated AAA, and few downgrades. We continue to have the ability and intent to hold these securities until any temporary impairment is recovered, or until maturity.
Below are the securities in our core portfolio, at fair value, which incorporates our unrealized loss, by credit rating.

We routinely test our investment portfolio securities for other-than-temporary impairment ("OTTI"). In the first quarter of 2008, we recorded a $74 million pre-tax securities loss associated with OTTI comprised of the following:

CAPITAL SUPPORT AGREEMENTS
During the first quarter of 2008, we executed a capital support agreement for a commingled short-term NAV fund ("CNAV Fund"), which is managed by securities lending in the Asset Servicing segment, of $55.5 million covering securities related to Whistle Jacket Capital/White Pine Financial, LLC ("Whistle Jacket"). Subsequently, we executed another capital support agreement for the same CNAV Fund of $30 million covering securities related to Thornburg Mortgage Capital Resources ("Thornburg"). Under these agreements, we will provide capital in specified circumstances to the CNAV Fund until June 30, 2008 in support of Whistle Jacket securities and April 2009 in support of Thornburg securities. Included in other expense during the first quarter of 2008 was $12 million associated with the current estimated fair value of the support agreements. We continue to monitor exposure to SIV senior note investments in the CNAV Funds we manage. On a case-by-case basis, depending on future circumstances, we could enter into further capital support agreements with the funds.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - RECONCILIATION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE  GAAP TO NON-GAAP
Reported amounts are presented in accordance with GAAP.

We believe they facilitate comparisons with prior periods and reflect the principal basis on which our management internally monitors financial performance. These non-GAAP items are also excluded from our segment measures used internally to evaluate segment performance because management does not consider them particularly relevant or useful in evaluating the operating performance of our business segments.
