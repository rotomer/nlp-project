Exhibit 99.1
 
All narrative comparisons in this Quarterly Earnings Summary are with the second quarter of 2007 and all information is reported on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise noted.
Throughout this Quarterly Earnings Summary, certain measures, which are noted, exclude certain items. We believe these measures are useful to the investment community in analyzing the financial results and trends of ongoing operations. We believe they facilitate comparisons with prior periods and they reflect the principal basis on which our management internally monitors financial performance. These items are also excluded from our segment measures used internally to evaluate segment performance because management does not consider them particularly relevant or useful in evaluating the operating performance of our business segments. Pro forma combined financial results for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation prior to the consummation of the merger exclude the pro forma impact of incremental purchase accounting including intangible amortization resulting from the merger.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT
A number of statements (i) in this Quarterly Earnings Summary, (ii) in our presentations and (iii) in the responses to questions are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements, which may be expressed in a variety of ways, including the use of future or present tense language, relate to, among other things, the Company's future financial goals, including future revenue, expenses and earnings, new business wins, and pipelines for new business; ability and intention to hold certain securities; expectations and other matters relating to SILO transactions; ability to achieve plans for revenue and expense synergies and growth in asset management and securities servicing businesses; possible future activities related to further entry into future capital support agreements; statements with respect to the merger integration, including revenue synergies and targeted run rates, expense synergy targets and estimated merger and integration charges; as well as the Company's overall plans, strategies, goals, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions, and are based on assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors (some of which are beyond the Company's control). Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of these risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the businesses of Mellon Financial and The Bank of New York may not be integrated successfully or the integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; the combined company may not realize, to the extent or at the time we expect, revenue synergies and cost savings from the transaction; service quality metrics in Asset Servicing may not be attained; revenue following the merger may be lower than expected as a result of losses of customers or other reasons; deposit attrition, operating costs, customer loss and business disruption following the merger, including, without limitation, difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, may be greater than expected; as well as the risk factors and other uncertainties set forth in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 and the Company's other filings with the SEC. Such forward-looking statements speak only as of July 17, 2008 and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after that date or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
The results prior to the consummation of the merger on July 1, 2007, reflect the sum of The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial's historical results, but do not include the pro forma impact of purchase accounting adjustments. The business segment combined results, for periods prior to the merger, reflect actions taken to report consistent transfer pricing and cost allocation methodologies as well as intercompany eliminations between The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO
At June 30, 2008, investment securities totaled $44.3 billion, which consists of our core portfolio of $41.5 billion and Three Rivers Funding Corp.'s ("TRFC") portfolio of $2.8 billion. TRFC was consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2007. The unrealized net of tax loss on our total securities available for sale portfolio was $1.818 billion at June 30 2008, which was comprised of $1.480 billion in our core portfolio and $338 million in our TRFC portfolio. The unrealized net of tax loss at March 31, 2008 was $1.789 billion, which was comprised of $1.523 billion in our core portfolio and $266 million in our TRFC portfolio. The increase in the unrealized net of tax loss in the second quarter of 2008 compared with the first quarter of 2008 resulted from higher interest rates partially offset by narrower credit spreads.
At June 30, 2008, the unrealized net of tax loss on our securities available for sale portfolio decreased our adjusted tangible common equity to assets ratio by 93 basis points. We continue to have the ability and intent to hold our investment securities until any temporary impairment is recovered, or until maturity. The securities in our core asset and mortgage-backed securities portfolio continued to remain highly rated, with 93% rated AAA.
Below are the securities in our core portfolio, at fair value, which incorporates our unrealized loss, by credit rating.
 
Below are the securities in the TRFC portfolio, at fair value which incorporates our unrealized loss, by credit rating.
 
We routinely test our investment securities for other than temporary impairment ("OTTI"). In the second quarter of 2008, we assumed an additional 17% decline in national home prices over the next two years and estimated the impact it would have on the cash flows underlying the individual securities. As a result, we impaired certain securities and wrote them down to current market value and recorded a $152 million pre-tax securities loss associated with OTTI comprising the following:
 
 
 
Page 9
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 2Q08 Quarterly Earnings Summary
 
 
Our Alt-A portfolio is 99% AAA-rated and 1% AA-rated. At origination, the portfolio's weighted-average FICO score was 716 and its weighted-average LTV was 74%. Approximately 50% of the total portfolio is supported by better performing fixed-rate collateral. Finally, the portfolio's weighted-average current credit enhancement is 13%.
The HELOC securities in the TRFC portfolio are tested for impairment based on the quality of the underlying security and the condition of the monoline insurer providing credit support. Securities were deemed impaired if we expected they would not be repaid in full without the support of the insurer and the insurer was rated below investment grade.
At June 30, 2008, the combined fair value of the core and TRFC subprime mortgage securities portfolios was $1.3 billion with 85% of the portfolios rated AA or higher. The core portfolio is primarily comprised of vintages from 2005 or earlier. The TRFC portfolio is primarily comprised of vintages originated in 2006 and 2007. The weighted-average current credit enhancement on these portfolios was 35% at June 30, 2008.
SILO TRANSACTIONS
In the second quarter of 2008 we recorded a $380 million charge related to sale-in, lease-out (SILO) transactions. This charge includes $237 million, in accordance with FAS 13-2, related to revising the cash flows associated with the Company's SILO transactions, as well as $143 million for establishing interest reserves on associated tax benefits. The charge was prompted by recent federal court decisions in and , where the tax benefits from certain SILO and lease-in, lease-out (LILO) transactions were denied. In the third quarter of 2008, we expect to deposit funds with the IRS to offset the accrual of interest on the disputed SILO transactions. The cost of the deposit, as well as the recalculation of the cash flows associated with the SILO transactions will result in a decrease in earnings per share of approximately $0.02 per share in both the second half of 2008 and full year 2009. We continue to believe our tax treatment of the SILO transactions was proper under the tax law as it existed at the time the tax benefits were reported. We are currently in discussions with the IRS.

AWG Leasing Trust v. United States
CAPITAL SUPPORT AGREEMENTS
During the second quarter of 2008, we executed the following capital support agreements: $28.6 million and $18 million covering securities in two short-term net asset value ("NAV") funds, both in the Asset Management segment. These agreements are in addition to the capital support agreement for the commingled short-term NAV fund ("CNAV fund") of $55.5 million covering securities related to Whistle Jacket Capital/White Pine Financial, LLC, in the Asset Servicing segment. Under these agreements, we could provide capital in specified circumstances in varying maturities through June 2009. A previously disclosed capital support agreement for the CNAV Fund covering securities related to Thornburg Mortgage Capital Resources was canceled during the second quarter of 2008 resulting in a $12 million credit recorded in Other expense, which was partially offset by $8 million of expense related to the current estimated fair value of the remaining capital support agreements. We continue to monitor exposure to NAV and money market funds that we manage. On a case-by-case basis, depending on future circumstances, we could enter into further capital support agreements with the funds.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS
During the second quarter of 2008 we moved the financial results of Mellon 1
St
Business Bank, National Association and Mellon United National Bank to the Other segment from the Wealth Management segment. This change reflects the sale of Mellon 1
st
Business Bank in June 2008, as well as our focus on reducing non-core activities. Historical segment results for Wealth Management and Other have been restated to reflect these changes.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - GAAP TO NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS
Reported amounts are presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that this supplemental non-GAAP information is useful to the investment community in analyzing the financial results and trends of our business. We believe this information facilitates comparisons with prior periods and reflects the principal basis on which our management internally monitors financial performance. These items are also excluded from our segment measures used internally to evaluate segment performance because management does not consider them to be particularly relevant or useful in evaluating the operating performance of our business segments.
 
 
 
SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION  CONVERTED EARNINGS PER SHARE
In the merger transaction between The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial, The Bank of New York shareholders received 0.9434 shares of the Company's common stock for each share of The Bank of New York common stock outstanding on the closing date of the merger. Mellon Financial shareholders received one share of the Company's common stock for each share of Mellon Financial common stock outstanding on the closing date of the merger.
Converting The Bank of New York Company's common stock into post-merger share count terms for the second quarter of 2007 increased diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per share excluding merger and integration expense by $0.03 and increased diluted earnings per share excluding merger and integration expense and intangible amortization by $0.04.

The results prior to the consummation of the merger, reflect the sum of The Bank of New York and Mellon's historical results, but do not include the pro forma impact of purchase accounting adjustments. Combined results for the periods prior to the merger (1Q06 - 2Q07) are presented on a pre-tax basis only. Average common equity and average goodwill/intangibles are not disclosed for the periods prior to the merger due to the impact of the merger on these line items. The business segment results are presented on a pre-tax basis for all periods and reflect actions taken to report consistent transfer pricing and cost allocation methodologies as well as intercompany eliminations between The Bank of New York and Mellon.
Summations may not equal due to rounding. As a result of this rounding convention, immaterial differences may exist between the segment trends data versus the segment trends data filed on Form 10-Q.
