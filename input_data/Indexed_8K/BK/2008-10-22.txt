CAUTIONARY STATEMENT
A number of statements (i) in this Quarterly Earnings Summary, (ii) in our presentations and (iii) in the responses to questions are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements, which may be expressed in a variety of ways, including the use of future or present tense language, relate to, among other things, the Company's future financial goals, including future revenue, expenses and earnings, new business wins, and pipelines for new business; ability and intention to hold certain securities; assumptions regarding additional declines in national home prices and estimated impact of these declines; ability to achieve plans for revenue and expense synergies and growth in asset management and securities servicing businesses; statements with respect to the merger integration, including revenue synergies and targeted run rates, expense synergy targets and estimated merger and integration charges; as well as the Company's overall plans, strategies, goals, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions, and are based on assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors (some of which are beyond the Company's control). Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of these risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the businesses of Mellon Financial and The Bank of New York may not be integrated successfully or the integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; the combined company may not realize, to the extent or at the time we expect, revenue synergies and cost savings from the transaction; service quality metrics in Asset Servicing may not be attained; revenue following the merger may be lower than expected as a result of losses of customers or other reasons; deposit attrition, operating costs, customer loss and business disruption following the merger, including, without limitation, difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, may be greater than expected; as well as the risk factors and other uncertainties set forth in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 and the Company's other filings with the SEC. Such forward-looking statements speak only as of October 16, 2008 and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after that date or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
NON-GAAP MEASURES
Throughout this Quarterly Earnings Summary, certain financial measures, which are noted, exclude or are adjusted for certain items. These adjustments or exclusions can impact revenue, noninterest expense, pre-tax income, net income and earnings per share amounts as well as related ratios and growth rates. We believe this supplemental non-GAAP information is useful to the investment community in analyzing the financial results and trends in our business. We believe this information facilitates comparisons with prior periods and reflects the principal basis on which our management internally monitors financial performance. These items also are excluded from our segment measures used internally to evaluate segment performance because management does not consider them to be particularly relevant or useful in evaluating the operating performance of our business segments. Below is a listing of financial measures which have been impacted by the exclusion and/or adjustment of certain items.
Revenue: SILO/LILO/tax settlement charges and securities losses
Noninterest expense: Support agreement charges, merger & integration and intangible amortization expenses
Earnings per share: SILO/LILO/tax settlement charges, support agreement charges and merger & integration expenses. Earnings per share calculations do not exclude securities losses.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO
At Sept. 30, 2008, our investment securities portfolio totaled $41.6 billion. The unrealized net of tax loss on our total securities portfolio was $2.8 billion at Sept. 30, 2008. The unrealized net of tax loss at June 30, 2008 was $1.8 billion. The increase compared to the prior quarter was primarily driven by wider credit spreads. The securities in our portfolio continued to remain highly rated, with 91% rated AAA/AA.
The following table provides the detail of our total securities portfolio.
 
At Sept. 30, 2008, we assumed an additional decline of approximately 15% in national home prices over the next two years and estimated the impact it would have on the cash flows of the underlying individual securities. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge and wrote down to current market value certain securities, resulting in a $162 million pre-tax securities loss comprised of the following:
 
At the time of purchase, 100% of our Alt-A portfolio was rated AAA. At Sept. 30, 2008, this portfolio had migrated to 74% AAA-rated, 10% AA-rated, 10% A-rated and 6% other. At the time of purchase, the portfolio's weighted-average FICO score was 711 and its weighted-average LTV was 74%. Approximately 50% of the total portfolio is supported by better performing fixed-rate collateral. Finally, the portfolio's weighted-average current credit enhancement is approximately 13%. The unrealized loss on the Alt-A portfolio at Sept. 30, 2008 was $2.3 billion.
At Sept. 30, 2008, the fair value of our total asset-backed securities ("ABS") CDOs was $51 million. The fair value of this portfolio, net of OTTI, was 11% of par at Sept. 30, 2008. At Sept. 30, 2008, $12 million of ABS CDOs are included in trading assets and $39 million are included in securities available-for-sale.

The home equity lines of credit ("HELOC") securities are tested for impairment based on the quality of the underlying security and the condition of the monoline insurer providing credit support. Securities were deemed impaired if we expected they would not be repaid in full without the support of the insurer and the insurer was rated below investment grade. The securities losses in the third quarter of 2008 related to HELOC securities resulted from both a deterioration of specific securities combined with weakening credit support due to below investment grade ratings of certain bond insurers.
At Sept. 30, 2008, the fair value of our subprime mortgage securities portfolio was $1.2 billion with 81% of the portfolio rated AA or higher. The weighted-average current credit enhancement on this portfolio was approximately 35% at Sept. 30, 2008.
SILO/LILO AND TAX SETTLEMENTS
In the third quarter of 2008, we reached a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") to formally close our 1998 through 2002 audit cycle. We also settled our 1994 through 1996 New York State and New York City audits. As part of the IRS settlement, we also accepted the IRS uniform SILO/LILO settlement offer announced on Aug. 6, 2008. The combined after-tax charge of the settlements was $30 million. In the second quarter of 2008 we recorded a $380 million after-tax charge related to the SILO transactions covered by this settlement.
SUPPORT AGREEMENTS
As previously disclosed, BNY Mellon elected to support its clients invested in money market mutual funds, cash sweep funds and similar collective funds impacted by the Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. ("Lehman") bankruptcy filing. The support agreements relate to five commingled cash funds used primarily for overnight custody cash sweeps, four Dreyfus money market funds and various securities lending customers. These agreements are in addition to agreements that existed at June 30, 2008 covering SIV exposure in two short-term net asset value funds and the support agreements covering securities related to Whistle Jacket Capital/White Pine Financial, LLC to a commingled short-term net asset value fund.
During the third quarter of 2008, we also offered to support certain clients holding auction rate securities in the Wealth Management (expense of $15 million) and Treasury Services (expense of $3 million) segments.

BALANCE SHEET
During the recent market turmoil, there was a significant increase in deposits, reflecting client reactions to market volatility. Due to the anticipated short-term nature of these deposits, we have placed them primarily with either the Federal Reserve or in overnight deposits with large global banks. At Sept. 30, 2008, total assets grew to $267.5 billion compared with $201.2 billion at June 30, 2008. Total assets averaged $198.8 billion for the third quarter of 2008, compared with $196.0 billion for the second quarter of 2008. Deposits totaled $174.2 billion at Sept. 30, 2008 and $127.2 billion at June 30, 2008. Total deposits averaged $120.3 billion in the third quarter of 2008 and $119.6 billion in the second quarter of 2008.
The recent market events resulted in a significant increase in our percentage of liquid assets to total assets to 43% at Sept. 30, 2008 from 30% at June 30, 2008. At Sept. 30, 2008, we had approximately $70.9 billion of overnight liquid funds and cash of $45.3 billion (including approximately $37.9 billion on deposit with the Federal Reserve) for a total of approximately $116.2 billion of available funds.
CAPITAL RATIOS
The capital ratios for the third quarter of 2008 reflect the record level of client deposits generated subsequent to the market turmoil that began in mid-September. Noninterest-bearing deposits were $82 billion at Sept. 30, 2008, $31 billion at June 30, 2008 and $27 billion at Sept. 30, 2007. The Company placed an increased level of deposits principally with either the Federal Reserve or in overnight deposits with large global banks. At the end of the third quarter, total assets were $268 billion and averaged $199 billion during the quarter.
The unrealized net of tax loss on our securities portfolio was $2.8 billion at Sept. 30, 2008 compared with $1.8 billion at June 30, 2008. The increase primarily resulted from wider credit spreads.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - EXPLANATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Reported amounts are presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the supplemental non-GAAP information included in this earnings summary is useful to the investment community in analyzing the financial results and trends of our business. This information facilitates comparisons with prior periods and reflects the principal basis on which our management internally monitors financial performance. These items also reflect certain items that are excluded from our segment measures used internally to evaluate segment performance because management does not consider them to be particularly relevant or useful in evaluating the operating performance of our business segments.

Notes:
On July 1, 2007, The Bank of New York Company, Inc. ("The Bank of New York") and Mellon Financial Corporation ("Mellon") merged into The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation ("The Bank of New York Mellon" or " BNY Mellon"), with BNY Mellon being the surviving entity.
The results prior to the consummation of the merger, reflect the sum of The Bank of New York and Mellon's historical results, but do not include the pro forma impact of purchase accounting adjustments. Combined results for the periods prior to the merger (1Q06 - 2Q07) are presented on a pre-tax basis only. Average common equity and average goodwill/intangibles are not disclosed for the periods prior to the merger due to the impact of the merger on these line items. The business segment results are presented on a pre-tax basis for all periods and reflect actions taken to report consistent transfer pricing and cost allocation methodologies as well as intercompany eliminations between The Bank of New York and Mellon.
Summations may not equal due to rounding. As a result of this rounding convention, immaterial differences may exist between the segment trends data versus the segment trends data filed on Form 10-Q.
The following acquisitions/divestitures have impacted the reporting of our results:

In addition, the financial results of Mellon United National Bank (MUNB) have been moved from the Wealth Management segment to the Other segment. Historical segment results have been restated to reflect these changes.
During the first quarter of 2008, we sold the B-Trade and G-Trade execution businesses to BNY ConvergEx Group LLC. We maintain a 35% equity interest in BNY ConvergEx Group LLC. The historical results of the B-Trade and G-Trade businesses are included in the Clearing Services segment.
On December 20, 2007, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in the ABN AMRO Mellon joint venture. The financial results are included in the Asset Servicing segment.
On October 2, 2006, Mellon Financial Corporation completed the acquisition of Walter Scott & Partners. The financial results are included in the Asset Management segment.
On October 1, 2006, The Bank of New York acquired JPMorgan Chase's Corporate Trust business in exchange for our retail and regional middle market banking businesses. Results of the Corporate Trust business are included in the Issuer Services segment.
