The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) today reported fourth quarter income from continuing operations, before an extraordinary item, and after preferred stock dividends, of $53 million, or $0.05 per common share. This compares to income from continuing operations, before an extraordinary item, of $700 million, or $0.61 per common share, in the fourth quarter of 2007 and $305 million, or $0.26 per common share, in the third quarter of 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2008, net income applicable to common stock, including the impact of an extraordinary item, was $28 million, or $0.02 per common share.
NEW YORK, January 20, 2009 
"In an extraordinarily challenging year, we generated profits in every quarter, achieved revenue growth of 9%, gained share in our businesses, outperformed on the merger and integration goals and had top-ranked client service globally. As we enter 2009, our business model works and we continue to maintain the capital strength needed in this uncertain market environment. I want to thank all of our employees, as our success is a reflection of their excellent work," said Robert P. Kelly, chairman and chief executive officer of The Bank of New York Mellon.
"Our operating performance during the fourth quarter includes record revenue from our institutional servicing businesses and well-controlled operating expenses. These results were offset by securities write-downs reflecting their deterioration and enormous liquidity discounts for mortgage-backed securities. We believe that the actual incurred loss will ultimately be materially lower based on current assumptions. We should have the opportunity to earn back a substantial portion of the write-downs over the remaining lives of the securities."
Income from continuing operations, before an extraordinary item, and after preferred stock dividends, for the full-year 2008 totaled $1.409 billion, or $1.22 per common share, compared with $2.227 billion, or $2.38 per common share, before an extraordinary item, in 2007. Net income applicable to common stock for the full-year 2008 totaled $1.386 billion, or $1.20 per common share, compared with $2.039 billion, or $2.18 per common share, for full-year 2007.

Investment Securities Portfolio
At Dec. 31, 2008, our investment securities portfolio totaled $39.4 billion. The unrealized net of tax loss on our total securities portfolio was $4.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2008. The unrealized net of tax loss at Sept. 30, 2008 was $2.8 billion. The increase compared to the prior quarter was primarily driven by wider credit spreads.
The following table provides the detail of our total securities portfolio.
 
Note: The "Watch list" includes those securities we view as having a higher risk of additional impairment charges.
Since the end of the third quarter, the housing market indicators and the broader economy have deteriorated significantly. Therefore, in the fourth quarter of 2008, we adjusted our modeling assumptions to reflect this further deterioration. Accordingly, we changed the modeling assumptions on all Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities ("RMBS") with the primary changes being on the default rates. In addition, to properly reflect the declining value of homes in the current foreclosure environment, we adjusted our RMBS loss severity assumptions to decrease the amount we expect to receive to cover the value of the original loan. As a result of these adjustments to our assumptions, a larger number of securities (primarily Alt-A) generated an expected loss and consequently, we recorded an impairment charge and wrote down to current market value those securities, resulting in a $1.2 billion pre-tax securities loss comprised of the following:
 
At Dec. 31, 2008, the expected incurred loss included in securities write-downs recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 is estimated to be $208 million. The difference between the expected loss and the total impairment charges incurred during the fourth quarter of 2008 is largely driven by the market illiquidity relating to mortgage-backed securities. The underlying market discount rate rose throughout 2008, particularly during the fourth quarter, and accounted for the gap between the expected loss and the impairment charges. The expected loss to be incurred is determined based on a projected principal write-down of a mortgage-backed security that occurs when the losses on the underlying mortgage pool are expected to be large enough to cause a reduction in the total contractual amount of principal that we are entitled to receive pursuant to the terms of the security.

At the time of purchase, the Alt-A portfolio's weighted-average FICO score was 715 and its weighted-average LTV was 74%. Approximately 50% of the total portfolio is supported by better-performing fixed-rate collateral. Finally, the portfolio's weighted-average current credit enhancement is approximately 13%. The unrealized loss on the Alt-A portfolio at Dec. 31, 2008 was $2.8 billion.
The home equity lines of credit ("HELOC") securities are tested for impairment based on the quality of the underlying security and the condition of the monoline insurer providing credit support. Securities were deemed impaired if we expected they would not be repaid in full without the support of the insurer and the insurer was rated below investment grade. The securities write-downs in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to HELOC securities resulted from both a deterioration of specific securities combined with weak credit support due to below investment grade ratings of certain bond insurers.
Restructuring Charge
In November 2008, the Company announced that due to weakness in the global economy it would reduce its workforce by approximately 4%, or 1,800 positions. The goals of this workforce reduction are to reduce expense growth and further improve the efficiency of the organization. This program is expected to result in annualized savings of $160-170 million.
In December 2008, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $181 million or $0.09 per common share. This charge was comprised of $166 million for severance costs, $9 million of expense from stock-based award acceleration, $5 million of other compensation costs and $1 million of non-personnel expenses directly related to the workforce reduction. The restructuring charge is recorded as a separate line on the income statement. The Company also expects to record an additional related charge of approximately $20-25 million, pre-tax, of restructuring expense in the first half of 2009, primarily related to severance and accruals for vacant space.
Extraordinary Loss on Consolidation of Commercial Paper Conduit
On Dec. 30, 2008, we voluntarily called the first loss notes of Old Slip Funding LLC ("Old Slip"), making us the primary beneficiary and triggering the consolidation of Old Slip (approximately $125 million in assets). The consolidation resulted in the recognition of an extraordinary loss (non-cash accounting charge) of $26 million after tax, or $0.02 per common share, representing the current mark-to-market discount from par associated with spread-widening for the assets in Old Slip.
Series B-Perpetual Preferred Stock
On Oct. 28, 2008, we issued $3 billion of securities to the U.S. Department of the Treasury comprised of Series B preferred stock ($2.779 billion) and a warrant for common stock ($221 million) as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program ("TARP") Capital Purchase Program authorized under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. The preferred dividends and the amortization of the discount on the Series B preferred stock reduced net income applicable to common stock by $33 million, or $ 0.03 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2008 and are expected to reduce earnings per share by approximately $0.16 per common share in 2009.
The proceeds from the Series B preferred stock have been utilized to improve the flow of funds in the financial markets. Specifically we have:
 
All of these efforts address the need to improve liquidity in the financial system and are consistent with our business model which is focused on institutional clients.

Nonperforming Assets
 
Consolidated Net Income Applicable to Common Stock, Including Discontinued Operations
Net income applicable to common stock, including discontinued operations, totaled $28 million, or $0.02 per common share, in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with $303 million, or $0.26 per common share, in the third quarter of 2008 and $520 million, or $0.45 per common share, in the fourth quarter of 2007.
