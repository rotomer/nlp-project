CAUTIONARY STATEMENT
A number of statements (i) in this Quarterly Earnings Review, (ii) in our presentations and (iii) in the responses to questions are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements, which may be expressed in a variety of ways, including the use of future or present tense language, relate to, among other things, expectations with respect to workforce reduction program, including annualized savings and additional pre-tax charge; actual incurred losses on securities portfolio and the ability to earn back a substantial portion of the write-downs over the remaining lives of the securities; anticipated expenses in connection with participation in FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program; impact of preferred stock dividends and amortization of discount on earnings per share; estimated impact of varying scenarios on capital ratios and proforma capital ratios; impact of institutional credit strategy; asset servicing goals; statements with respect to the merger integration, including revenue synergies and targeted run rates, expense synergy targets and estimated merger and integration charges; as well as the Company's overall plans, strategies, goals, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions, and are based on assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors (some of which are beyond the Company's control). Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of these risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risk factors and other uncertainties set forth in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2007 , the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2008, and the Company's other filings with the SEC. Such forward-looking statements speak only as of Jan. 20, 2009 and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after that date or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
NON-GAAP MEASURES
Throughout this Quarterly Earnings Review, certain financial measures, which are noted, exclude or are adjusted for certain items. These adjustments or exclusions can impact revenue, noninterest expense, pre-tax income, net income and earnings per share amounts as well as related ratios and growth rates. We believe this supplemental non-GAAP information is useful to the investment community in analyzing the financial results and trends in our business. We believe this information facilitates comparisons with prior periods and reflects the principal basis on which our management internally monitors financial performance. These items also are excluded from our segment measures used internally to evaluate segment performance because management does not consider them to be particularly relevant or useful in evaluating the operating performance of our business segments. Below is a listing of certain financial measures which have been impacted by the exclusion and/or adjustment of certain items.
Revenue: SILO/LILO/tax settlement charges and securities write-downs
Noninterest expense: Support agreement and restructuring charges, merger & integration and intangible amortization expenses
Earnings per share: SILO/LILO/tax settlement charges, securities write-downs, support agreement and restructuring charges, merger & integration and intangible amortization expenses.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO
At Dec. 31, 2008, our investment securities portfolio totaled $39.4 billion. The unrealized net of tax loss on our total securities portfolio was $4.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2008. The unrealized net of tax loss at Sept. 30, 2008 was $2.8 billion. The increase compared to the prior quarter was primarily driven by wider credit spreads.
The following table provides the detail of our total securities portfolio.
 
Note: The "Watch List" includes those securities we view as having a higher risk of additional impairment charges.
Since the end of the third quarter, the housing market indicators and the broader economy have deteriorated significantly. Therefore, in the fourth quarter of 2008, we adjusted our modeling assumptions to reflect this further deterioration. Accordingly, we changed the modeling assumptions on all Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS) with the primary changes being on the default rates. In addition, to properly reflect the declining value of homes in the current foreclosure environment, the Company adjusted its RMBS loss severity assumptions to decrease the amount it expects to receive to cover the value of the original loan. As a result of these adjustments to our assumptions, a larger number of securities (primarily Alt-A) generated an expected loss and consequently, we recorded an impairment charge and wrote down to current market value those securities, resulting in a $1.2 billion pre-tax securities loss comprised of the following:
 
At Dec. 31, 2008, the expected loss included in securities write-downs recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 is estimated to be $208 million. The difference between the expected loss and the total impairment charges incurred during the fourth quarter of 2008 is large driven by the market illiquidity relating to mortgage-backed securities. The underlying market discount rate rose throughout 2008, particularly during the fourth quarter, and accounted for the gap between the expected loss and the impairment charges. The expected loss is determined based on a projected principal write-down of a mortgage-backed security that occurs when the losses on the underlying
 
 
Page 9

mortgage pool are expected to be large enough to cause a reduction in the total contractual amount of principal that the Company is entitled to receive pursuant to the terms of the security.
At the time of purchase, the Alt-A portfolio's weighted-average FICO score was 715 and its weighted-average LTV was 74%. Approximately 50% of the total portfolio is supported by better performing fixed-rate collateral. Finally, the portfolio's weighted-average current credit enhancement is approximately 13%. The unrealized loss on the Alt-A portfolio at Dec. 31, 2008 was $2.8 billion.
The home equity lines of credit ("HELOC") securities are tested for impairment based on the quality of the underlying security and the condition of the monoline insurer providing credit support. Securities were deemed impaired if we expected they would not be repaid in full without the support of the insurer and the insurer was rated below investment grade. The securities write-downs in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to HELOC securities resulted from both a deterioration of specific securities combined with weakening credit support due to below investment grade ratings of certain bond insurers.
RESTRUCTURING CHARGE
In November 2008, the Company announced that due to weakness in the global economy it would reduce its workforce by approximately 4%, or 1,800 positions. The goals of this workforce reduction are to reduce expense growth and further improve the efficiency of the organization. This program is expected to result in annualized savings of $160-170 million.
In December 2008, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $181 million or $0.09 per common share. This charge was comprised of $166 million for severance costs, $9 million of expense from stock-based award acceleration, $5 million of other compensation costs and $1 million of non-personnel expenses directly related to the workforce reduction. The restructuring charge is recorded as a separate line on the income statement. The Company also expects to record an additional related charge of approximately $20-25 million, pre-tax, of restructuring expense in the first half of 2009, primarily related to severance and accruals for vacant space.
EXTRAORDINARY LOSS ON CONSOLIDATION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUIT
On Dec. 30, 2008, we voluntarily called the first loss notes of Old Slip Funding LLC ("Old Slip"), making us the primary beneficiary and triggering the consolidation of Old Slip (approximately $125 million in assets). The consolidation resulted in the recognition of an extraordinary loss (non-cash accounting charge) of $26 million after tax, or $0.02 per common share, representing the current mark-to-market discount from par associated with spread-widening for the assets in Old Slip.
BALANCE SHEET
The balance sheet at the end of the fourth quarter of 2008 totaled $237 billion compared to $198 billion at Dec. 31, 2007 and $268 billion at Sept. 30, 2008. We continued to benefit from an above trend level of client deposits, particularly noninterest-bearing client deposits. In addition, at year end, we maintained $53 billion in deposits with the Federal Reserve.

SERIES B-PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK
On Oct. 28, 2008, we issued $3 billion of securities to the U.S. Department of the Treasury comprised of Series B preferred stock ($2.779 billion) and a warrant for common stock ($221 million) as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program ("TARP") Capital Purchase Program authorized under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. The preferred dividends and the amortization of the discount on the Series B preferred stock reduced net income applicable to common stock by $33 million, or $ 0.03 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2008 and are expected to reduce earnings per share by approximately $0.16 per common share in 2009.
The proceeds from the Series B preferred stock have been utilized to improve the flow of funds in the financial markets. Specifically we have:
 
All of these efforts address the need to improve liquidity in the financial system and are consistent with our business model which is focused on institutional clients.
CAPITAL RATIOS
The capital ratios at Dec. 31, 2008 compared with Sept. 30, 2008 reflect the benefit we received from the $3 billion of Series B preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury in October of 2008 and a lower level of risk adjusted assets.

STRESS TESTING CAPITAL RATIOS FOR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO VALUATION DECLINES
We routinely stress test the adequacy of our capital base by modeling the impact to our Tier 1 capital and tangible capital ratios for impairments and valuation declines related to our investment securities portfolio.
The table below provides pro forma estimates of the Tier 1, tangible and adjusted tangible capital ratios, utilizing ratios at Dec. 31, 2008 as the base, adjusted for the estimated impact of varying levels of 2009 First Call earnings estimates, and stress tested at increasing levels of impairments and valuation declines.
