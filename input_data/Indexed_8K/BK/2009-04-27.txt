CAUTIONARY STATEMENT
A number of statements (i) in this Quarterly Earnings Review, (ii) in our presentations and (iii) in the responses to questions may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements, which may be expressed in a variety of ways, including the use of future or present tense language, relate to, among other things, investments in assets subsequent to the end of first quarter of 2009; FDIC deposit assessments; expectations with respect to service quality; expectations with respect to the timing and amount of future dividends and growth; repayment of the TARP investment; and expected losses on the securities portfolio; as well as the Company's overall plans, strategies, goals, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions. These statements are based upon current beliefs and expectations and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Company's control). Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of these risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risk factors and other uncertainties set forth in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2008 and the Company's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements in this earnings review speak only as of April 21, 2009 and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after that date or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
NON-GAAP MEASURES
Throughout this Quarterly Earnings Review, certain financial measures, which are noted, exclude and/or are adjusted for certain items. These adjustments or exclusions can impact revenue, noninterest expense, pre-tax income, net income and earnings per share amounts as well as related ratios and growth rates. We believe this supplemental non-GAAP information is useful to the investment community in analyzing the financial results and trends in our business. We believe this information facilitates comparisons with prior periods and reflects the principal basis on which our management internally monitors financial performance. These items also are excluded from our segment measures used internally to evaluate segment performance because management does not consider them to be particularly relevant or useful in evaluating the operating performance of our business segments. Below is a listing of certain financial measures which have been impacted by the exclusion and/or adjustment of certain items.
Revenue: Investment write-downs and SILO/LILO charges.
Noninterest expense: Support agreement and restructuring charges, merger & integration ("M&I") expenses; intangible amortization expense and goodwill impairment.
Earnings per share: Investment write-downs, SILO/LILO/tax settlement charges, support agreement and restructuring charges, M&I expenses, intangible amortization expense and goodwill impairment.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO
At March 31, 2009, the fair value of our investment securities portfolio totaled $36.6 billion. The unrealized net of tax loss on our available for sale securities portfolio was $4.5 billion at March 31, 2009. The unrealized net of tax loss at Dec. 31, 2008 was $4.1 billion.
The following table provides the detail of our total securities portfolio.
 
Since the end of the fourth quarter, the housing market indicators and the broader economy continued to deteriorate. To reflect the declining value of homes in the current environment, we adjusted our non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") loss severity assumptions to decrease the amount we expect to receive to cover the value of the original loan. These adjustments to our assumptions, along with projected defaults, generated a loss in our Alt-A securities portfolio of $125 million in the first quarter of 2009.
The following table provides the detail of securities portfolio losses for the first quarter of 2009.
 
Effective March 31, 2009, the Company adopted FAS 115-2 "Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment (OTTI)" which changes the accounting for OTTI. As a result, in the first quarter of 2009, the expected loss component of $295 million was recorded as a securities loss in earnings and the non-credit related component of $1.290 billion remains in accumulated OCI.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - EXPLANATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Reported amounts are presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the supplemental non-GAAP information is useful to the investment community in analyzing the financial results and trends of our business. We believe they facilitate comparisons with prior periods and reflect the principal basis on which our management internally monitors financial performance. These non-GAAP items are also excluded from our segment measures used internally to evaluate segment performance because management does not consider them to be particularly relevant or useful in evaluating the operating performance of our business segments.

Exhibit 99.2
 
Notes:
On July 1, 2007, The Bank of New York Company, Inc. ("The Bank of New York") and Mellon Financial Corporation ("Mellon") merged into The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation ("The Bank of New York Mellon" or "BNY Mellon"), with BNY Mellon being the surviving entity.
The results prior to the consummation of the merger, reflect the sum of The Bank of New York and Mellon's historical results, but do not include the pro forma impact of purchase accounting adjustments. Combined results for the periods prior to the merger (2006, 1Q07, 2Q07) are presented on a pre-tax basis only. Average common equity and average goodwill/intangibles are not disclosed for the periods prior to the merger due to the impact of the merger on these line items. The business segment results are presented on a pre-tax basis for all periods and reflect actions taken to report consistent transfer pricing and cost allocation methodologies as well as intercompany eliminations between The Bank of New York and Mellon.
Summations may not equal due to rounding. As a result of this rounding convention, immaterial differences may exist between the segment trends data versus the segment trends data filed on Form 10-Q.
The following transactions have impacted the reporting of our results:
On Jan. 1, 2009, we adopted FAS 160 which resulted in a reclassification of Minority Interest, to equity from other liabilities on the balance sheet and to noncontrolling interest from other expense on the income statement.
During the first quarter of 2009, we moved the financial results of the Execution business from the Clearing Services segment to the Other segment. Historical segment results have been restated to reflect these changes.
On June 3, 2008, we completed the sale of Mellon 1st Business Bank, National Association (N.A.). The financial results have been moved from the Wealth Management segment to the Other segment. In addition, the financial results of Mellon United National Bank (MUNB) have been moved from the Wealth Management segment to the Other segment. Historical segment results have been restated to reflect these changes.
On December 20, 2007, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in the ABN AMRO Mellon joint venture. The financial results are included in the Asset Servicing segment.
On October 1, 2006, The Bank of New York acquired JPMorgan Chase's Corporate Trust business in exchange for our retail and regional middle market banking businesses. Results of the Corporate Trust business are included in the Issuer Services segment.
The following transactions have impacted the reporting of our results:
Investment Write-downs  Impacted total revenue levels in the fourth quarter of 2007 and full year of 2008, and the first quarter of 2009.
Restructuring charge  Recorded charges in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009 related to the 4% global workforce reduction.
SILO/LILO/Tax settlement charges  Incurred charges in the second and third quarters of 2008.
Merger & integration/Intangible amortization expenses  Both expense categories increased beginning in the second/third quarters of 2007 as a result of The Bank of New York/Mellon merger.
Support agreement charges  Recorded a $163 million pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2008 and a $726 million pre-tax charge in the third quarter of 2008 (minor amounts recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007, first and second quarters of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009).
Goodwill impairment  Recorded a $50 million pre-tax charge in the first quarter of 2009 related to the Mellon United National Bank subsidiary.
All of these items are detailed in the trends that follow. In addition, page 15 provides additional details on the impact of the applicable items on total revenue as well the impact on Continuing operations fully diluted earnings per share.
Discontinued Operations Accounting:
The income/(loss) and average assets from discontinued operations accounting have not been allocated to any segment.
Average Assets:
Where average deposits in a business segment are greater than average loans, average assets include an allocation of investment securities equal to the difference. Consolidated average assets include average assets of discontinued operations.
Return on Common and Tangible Common Equity/Pretax Operating Margin:
Ratios are presented for continuing operations basis only. Quarterly return on common and tangible common equity ratios are annualized.
