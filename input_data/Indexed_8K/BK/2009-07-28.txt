Exhibit 99.1
 
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 2Q09 Quarterly Earnings Review
 
 
NON-GAAP MEASURES
The Company has included in this review certain Non-GAAP measures based upon tangible common shareholders' equity. The Company believes that the ratio of tangible common shareholders' equity to tangible assets, is a measure of capital strength that adds additional useful information to investors, supplementing the Tier 1 capital ratio which is utilized by regulatory authorities. Unlike the Tier 1 ratio, the tangible common shareholders' equity ratio fully incorporates those changes in securities valuations which are reflected in shareholders' equity. In addition, this ratio is expressed as a percentage of the actual book value of assets, as opposed to a percentage of a risk-based reduced value established in accordance with regulatory requirements, although the Company in its calculation has excluded certain assets which are given a zero percent risk weighting for regulatory purposes. This ratio is also informative to investors in the Company's common stock because, unlike the Tier 1 capital ratio, it excludes preferred stock and trust preferred securities issued by the Company. Further, the Company believes that the return on tangible common equity measure, which excludes goodwill and intangible assets net of deferred tax liability, is a useful additional measure for investors because it presents a measure of the Company's performance in reference to those assets which are productive in generating income.
The Company has also provided the measure of tangible book value per share which it believes provides additional useful information as to the level of such assets in relation to shares of common stock outstanding. The Company has presented revenue measures which exclude the effect of investment write-downs and a SILO charge; expense measures which exclude M&I expenses, intangible amortization expenses, the FDIC special assessment; and measures which utilize net income excluding tax items such as the benefit of tax settlements. Return on equity measures and operating margin measures which exclude some or all of these items are also presented. The Company believes that these measures are useful to investors because they permit a focus on period to period comparisons which relate to the ability of the Company to enhance revenues and limit expenses in circumstances where such matters are within the Company's control. The excluded items in general relate to situations where accounting rules require certain ongoing charges as a result of prior transactions, or where valuation or other accounting/regulatory requirements require charges unrelated to operational initiatives. The SILO charges relate to a one-time settlement with the IRS of tax structured lease transactions in 2008. We also present earnings information excluding the TARP dividend and redemption premium, so as to provide investors with a better understanding of operational results. In this earnings review, certain amounts are presented on an FTE basis. We believe that this presentation provides comparability of amounts arising from both taxable and tax exempt sources, and is consistent with industry practice. The adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income.
Each of these measures as described above is used by management to monitor financial performance, both on a Company-wide and on a business segment basis. Below is a listing of certain financial measures which have been impacted by the exclusion and/or adjustment of certain items.
Revenue: Investment write-downs and SILO charges.
Noninterest expense: Merger & integration ("M&I") expenses; intangible amortization expense and FDIC special assessment.
Earnings per share: Investment write-downs, M&I expenses, FDIC special assessment, intangible amortization expense, SILO charges, the benefit of tax settlements and the TARP redemption premium and dividend.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
On June 30, 2009, we adopted discontinued operations accounting for Mellon United National Bank located in Florida. It was determined that this business no longer fits our strategic focus on our asset management and securities servicing businesses. Accordingly, the income statements for all periods in this Earnings Review have been restated. The restatement resulted in a reduction to previously reported levels of net interest revenue and the net interest margin; a slight reduction in treasury services and other fee revenue; a reduction in the provision for credit losses; a reduction in noninterest expense; and a change in continuing earnings per share. This business was formerly included in the Other segment.

BALANCE SHEET
During the second quarter of 2009, the Company's average balance sheet decreased to $209 billion from $220 billion in the first quarter. The decrease was largely driven by a $13 billion reduction in deposits reflecting the continued roll off of client cash that sought a safe haven during the credit crisis. The offsetting reduction in assets was primarily due to a reduction in cash held at central banks. During the quarter, the Company also further reduced cash held at central banks and invested in securities issued by government-sponsored and guaranteed entities.
INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO
At June 30, 2009, the fair value of our investment securities portfolio totaled $48.2 billion. The unrealized net of tax loss on our securities portfolio recorded in OCI was $4.4 billion at June 30, 2009 compared with $4.5 billion at March 31, 2009. The improvement in the net of tax loss on our securities portfolio reflects the tightening of spreads, partially offset by higher interest rates and the impact of FAS 157-4.
As a result of adopting FAS 157-4, the unrealized pre-tax loss decreased by approximately $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2009, reflecting the price at which the securities would sell in a more orderly market. As the credit markets improved and became more orderly during the second quarter of 2009, the FAS 157-4 related unrealized pre-tax loss declined to approximately $400 million at June 30, 2009. Excluding the impact of FAS 157-4, the unrealized pre-tax loss on the securities portfolio would have decreased by approximately $1.0 billion (pre-tax) at June 30, 2009, and the fair value of the portfolio would have been $400 million (pre-tax) less than the current fair value.
The following table provides the detail of our total securities portfolio.
 
In the second quarter of 2009, housing market indicators and the broader economy continued to deteriorate. To reflect the continued declining value of homes, we adjusted our non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") loss severity assumptions to decrease the amount we expect to receive to cover the value of the original loan. In the second quarter of 2009, we reclassified the European Floating Rate Notes to the Watch List category. These securities are very highly rated (100% are included in the AAA/AA category) and well seasoned, but given the deterioration in the European housing market and the impairment of a small number of these securities, we determined a reclassification to the Watch List category was appropriate.

CAPITAL
On June 30, 2009, the Company submitted to the U.S. Treasury notice of our intention to repurchase the warrant which we issued to the Treasury in connection with the TARP Capital Purchase Program. The Company and the Treasury are currently discussing the terms of the proposed repurchase of the warrant.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
On June 30, 2009, we adopted discontinued operations accounting for Mellon United National Bank located in Florida. It was determined that this business no longer fits our strategic focus on our asset management and securities servicing businesses. This business was formerly included in the Other segment. In the second quarter of 2009, we recorded an after-tax loss on discontinued operations of $91 million primarily related to the write-down of goodwill and an increase in the provision for credit losses. The after-tax loss of $41 million in the first quarter of 2009 primarily resulted from a goodwill impairment charge.
The income statements for all periods in this Earnings Review have been restated. The restatement resulted in a reduction to previously reported levels of net interest revenue and the net interest margin; a slight reduction in treasury services and other fee revenue; a reduction in the provision for credit losses; a reduction in noninterest expense; and a change in continuing earnings per share.

Exhibit 99.2
 
Notes:
On July 1, 2007, The Bank of New York Company, Inc. ("The Bank of New York") and Mellon Financial Corporation ("Mellon") merged into The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation ("The Bank of New York Mellon" or "BNY Mellon"), with BNY Mellon being the surviving entity.
The results prior to the consummation of the merger, reflect the sum of The Bank of New York and Mellon's historical results, but do not include the pro forma impact of purchase accounting adjustments. Combined results for the periods prior to the merger (2006, 1Q07, 2Q07) are presented on a pre-tax basis only. Average common equity and average goodwill/intangibles are not disclosed for the periods prior to the merger due to the impact of the merger on these line items. The business segment results are presented on a pre-tax basis for all periods and reflect actions taken to report consistent transfer pricing and cost allocation methodologies as well as intercompany eliminations between The Bank of New York and Mellon.
Summations may not equal due to rounding. As a result of this rounding convention, immaterial differences may exist between the segment trends data versus the segment trends data filed on Form 10-Q.
The following transactions/changes have impacted the reporting of our results:
On June 30, 2009, we adopted discontinued operations accounting for Mellon United National Bank (MUNB) located in Miami, Florida. Previously, the financial results were included in the Other segment. Only the financial results for all periods of 2008 and 2009 have been restated.
On January 1, 2009, we adopted FAS 160, which resulted in a reclassification of minority interest to equity from other liabilities on the balance sheet and to noncontrolling interest from other expense on the income statement.
During the first quarter of 2009, we moved the financial results of the Execution business from the Clearing Services segment to the Other segment. Historical segment results have been restated to reflect these changes.
On June 3, 2008, we completed the sale of Mellon 1st Business Bank, National Association (N.A.). We moved the financial results from the Wealth Management segment to the Other segment. Historical segment results have been restated to reflect these changes.
On December 20, 2007, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in the ABN AMRO Mellon joint venture. The financial results are included in the Asset Servicing segment.
On October 1, 2006, The Bank of New York acquired the JPMorgan Chase Corporate Trust business in exchange for our retail and regional middle market banking businesses. Results of the Corporate Trust business are included in the Issuer Services segment.
The following items have impacted the reporting of our results:
Investment Write-downs  Impacted total revenue levels in the fourth quarter of 2007, full year of 2008, and the first and second quarters of 2009.

Support agreement charges  Recorded a $163 million pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2008 and a $726 million pre-tax charge in the third quarter of 2008 (minor amounts recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007, first and second quarters of 2008 and the first and second quarters of 2009).
All of these items are detailed in the trends that follow.
