Exhibit 99.1
 
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 3Q09 Quarterly Earnings Review
 
 
NON-GAAP MEASURES
BNY Mellon has included in this review certain Non-GAAP measures based upon tangible common shareholders' equity. BNY Mellon believes that the ratio of tangible common shareholders' equity to tangible assets, is a measure of capital strength that adds additional useful information to investors, supplementing the Tier 1 capital ratio which is utilized by regulatory authorities. Unlike the Tier 1 ratio, the tangible common shareholders' equity ratio fully incorporates those changes in investment securities valuations which are reflected in shareholders' equity. In addition, this ratio is expressed as a percentage of the actual book value of assets, as opposed to a percentage of a risk-based reduced value established in accordance with regulatory requirements, although BNY Mellon in its calculation has excluded certain assets which are given a zero percent risk-weighting for regulatory purposes. This ratio is also informative to investors in BNY Mellon's common stock because, unlike the Tier 1 capital ratio, it excludes preferred stock and trust preferred securities issued by BNY Mellon. Further, BNY Mellon believes that the return on tangible common equity measure, which excludes goodwill and intangible assets net of deferred tax liabilities, is a useful additional measure for investors because it presents a measure of BNY Mellon's performance in reference to those assets which are productive in generating income.
BNY Mellon has provided the measure of tangible book value per share, which it believes provides additional useful information as to the level of such assets in relation to shares of common stock outstanding. BNY Mellon has presented revenue and earnings measures which exclude the effect of investment securities losses and SILO/LILO charges; expense measures which exclude merger and integration ("M&I") expenses, intangible amortization expenses, support agreement charges, asset-based taxes, the FDIC special assessment; and measures which utilize net income excluding tax items such as the benefit of tax settlements. Return on equity measures and operating margin measures which exclude some or all of these items are also presented. We also present the aggregate unrealized investment securities losses excluding the impact of FAS 157-4 to provide investors with the impact disorderly markets had on the investment securities portfolio and the subsequent conversion to an orderly market. BNY Mellon believes that these measures are useful to investors because they permit a focus on period to period comparisons which relate to the ability of BNY Mellon to enhance revenues and limit expenses in circumstances where such matters are within BNY Mellon's control. The excluded items in general relate to situations where accounting rules require certain ongoing charges as a result of prior transactions, or where valuation or other accounting/regulatory requirements require charges unrelated to operational initiatives. M&I expense relates to our Corporate Trust acquisition in 2006 and to the merger with Mellon Financial Corporation in 2007. M&I expenses generally continue for approximately three years after the transaction, and can vary on a year-to-year basis depending on the stage of the transaction. BNY Mellon believes that the exclusion of M&I expenses provides investors with a focus on BNY Mellon's business as it would appear on a consolidated going-forward basis, after such M&I expenses have ceased, typically after approximately three years. Future periods will not reflect such M&I expenses, and thus may be more easily compared to our current results if M&I expenses are excluded. With regards to the exclusion of investment securities losses, BNY Mellon's primary businesses are Asset and Wealth Management and Institutional Services. The management of these sectors is evaluated on the basis of the ability of these businesses to generate fee and net interest revenue and to control expenses, and not on the results of BNY Mellon's investment securities portfolio. Management of the investment securities portfolio is a shared service contained in the Other segment. The primary objective of the investment securities portfolio is to generate net interest revenue from the liquidity generated by BNY Mellon's processing businesses. BNY Mellon does not generally originate or trade the securities in the investment securities portfolio. As a result, BNY Mellon believes that presenting measures which exclude investment securities losses from its results, as a supplement to GAAP information, gives investors a clearer picture of the results of its primary businesses.
The SILO/LILO charges relate to a one-time settlement with the IRS of tax structured lease transactions in 2008. We also present earnings information excluding the TARP redemption premium and dividend, so as to provide investors with a better understanding of operational results. In this earnings review, certain amounts are presented on an FTE basis. We believe that this presentation provides comparability of amounts arising from both taxable and tax exempt sources, and is consistent with industry practice. The adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income.
Each of these measures as described above is used by management to monitor financial performance, both on a company-wide and on a business segment basis. Below is a listing of certain financial measures which have been impacted by the exclusion and/or adjustment of certain items.
Revenue: Investment securities losses and SILO/LILO charges.
Noninterest expense: M&I expenses; intangible amortization expense, support agreement charges, FDIC special assessment and restructuring charge.
Earnings per share: Investment securities losses, M&I expenses, FDIC special assessment, support agreement charges, intangible amortization expense, SILO/LILO/tax settlement, the benefit of tax settlements and the TARP redemption premium and dividend.

Investment securities portfolio restructuring
Consistent with our ongoing strategy to reduce risk from the balance sheet, and reflecting the recent improvement in the fixed income markets, we have sold or are in the process of restructuring the watch list portion of our investment securities portfolio.
The restructuring impacts approximately $12.1 billion (pre-restructuring amortized cost) of investment securities. As a result of investment securities sales and restructuring in the third quarter of 2009, we recognized a charge of $4.8 billion (pre-tax). Subsequent to Sept. 30, 2009, approximately $2.1 billion (pre-restructuring amortized cost of $3.6 billion) of the lowest quality securities were sold at fair value. The majority of the remaining restructured investment securities are expected to be retained on the balance sheet. Approximately 50% of the charge relates to investment securities that we plan to retain an interest in and for which we expect to recover a portion of the loss over time. In the fourth quarter of 2009, any declines in the fair value of these investment securities will be reflected in our net income until the restructuring is complete.
The restructuring charge had a minimal impact on the tangible capital ratio, as 90% of the charge had previously been reflected in tangible capital.
As a result of the restructuring, we expect net interest revenue to be positively impacted by approximately $125-$175 million in 2010.
The fair value of the investment securities portfolio at Sept. 30, 2009 was $54.1 billion. On a pro forma basis, reflecting the subsequent sale of investment securities, the fair value at Sept. 30, 2009 was $52.0 billion. The unrealized loss on the portfolio was $1.4 billion at Sept. 30, 2009 compared with $7.7 billion at June 30, 2009. The improvement reflects $4.8 billion related to the restructuring and $1.5 billion ($1.8 billion without the FAS 157-4 adjustment) resulting from the improvement in the fixed income markets.

NONPERFORMING ASSETS
 
Nonperforming assets increased $182 million compared with June 30, 2009, reflecting downgrades, primarily in the insurance and media portfolios. The increase in nonperforming assets in the third quarter of 2009 resulted from $137 million in the insurance portfolio, $25 million in the media portfolio and a $21 million net increase in other residential mortgages.
ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PROVISION AND NET CHARGE-OFFS
 
The provision for credit losses was $147 million in 3Q09 compared with $61 million in 2Q09. The increase primarily relates to downgrades in the insurance and media portfolios. BNY Mellon expects the provision to decline in the fourth quarter of 2009. During the third quarter of 2009, the total allowance for credit losses increased $70 million and net charge-offs totaled $77 million.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In the second quarter of 2009, we adopted discontinued operations accounting for Mellon United National Bank located in Florida. It was determined that this business no longer fits our strategic focus on our asset management and securities servicing businesses. In July 2009, we signed a definitive agreement to sell Mellon United National Bank. Subject to regulatory approval, the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2010. This business was formerly included in the Other segment. In the third quarter of 2009, we recorded an after-tax loss on discontinued operations of $19 million primarily related to additional provision for credit losses resulting from the further deterioration of the South Florida real estate market. The after-tax loss of $151 million in the first nine months of 2009 primarily reflects the impairment and write-down of goodwill and an increase in the provision for credit losses.

Financial Trends
Notes:
On July 1, 2007, The Bank of New York Company, Inc. ("The Bank of New York") and Mellon Financial Corporation ("Mellon") merged with and into The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation ("The Bank of New York Mellon" or " BNY Mellon"), with BNY Mellon being the surviving entity ("the merger").
The results prior to the consummation of the merger reflect the sum of The Bank of New York and Mellon's historical results, but do not include the pro forma impact of purchase accounting adjustments. Combined results for the periods prior to the merger (2006, 1Q07, 2Q07) are presented on a pre-tax basis only. Average common equity and average goodwill/intangibles are not disclosed for the periods prior to the merger due to the impact of the merger on these line items. The business segment results are presented on a pre-tax basis for all periods and reflect actions taken to report consistent transfer pricing and cost allocation methodologies as well as intercompany eliminations between The Bank of New York and Mellon.
Summations may not equal due to rounding. As a result of this rounding convention, immaterial differences may exist between the segment trends data versus the segment trends data filed on Form 10-Q.
The following transactions/changes have impacted the reporting of our results:
On June 30, 2009, we adopted discontinued operations accounting for Mellon United National Bank (MUNB) located in Miami, Florida. Previously, the financial results were included in the Other segment. Only the financial results for all periods of 2007, 2008 and 2009 have been restated.
On January 1, 2009, we adopted FAS 160, which resulted in a reclassification of minority interest to equity from other liabilities on the balance sheet and to noncontrolling interest from other expense on the income statement.
During the first quarter of 2009, we moved the financial results of the Execution business from the Clearing Services segment to the Other segment. Historical segment results have been restated to reflect these changes.
On June 3, 2008, we completed the sale of Mellon 1st Business Bank, National Association (N.A.). We moved the financial results from the Wealth Management segment to the Other segment. Historical segment results have been restated to reflect these changes.
On December 20, 2007, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in the ABN AMRO Mellon joint venture. The financial results are included in the Asset Servicing segment.
On October 1, 2006, The Bank of New York acquired the JPMorgan Chase Corporate Trust business in exchange for our retail and regional middle market banking businesses. Results of the Corporate Trust business are included in the Issuer Services segment.
The following items have impacted the reporting of our results:
Investment Securities Portfolio restructuring/ Investment Write-downs  Impacted total revenue levels in the fourth quarter of 2007, full year of 2008, and the first, second and third quarters of 2009.
The TARP preferred dividends and related redemption premium impacted the fourth quarter of 2008, and the first and second quarters of 2009.
The FDIC Special Assessment of all depository institutions impacted the second quarter of 2009.
Workforce reduction restructuring charge  Recorded charges in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first and second quarters of 2009 related to the 4% global workforce reduction.
SILO/LILO/Tax settlement charges  Incurred charges in the second and third quarters of 2008, while the second quarter of 2009 contains the benefit of final tax settlements.
Merger & integration/Intangible amortization expenses  Both expense categories increased beginning in the second/third quarters of 2007 as a result of the merger.
Support agreement charges  Recorded a $163 million pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2008 and a $726 million pre-tax charge in the third quarter of 2008 (minor amounts recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007, first and second quarters of 2008 and the first and second quarters of 2009).
All of these items are detailed in the trends that follow.
Discontinued Operations Accounting:
The income/(loss) and average assets from discontinued operations accounting have not been allocated to any segment.
Average Assets:
In business segments where average deposits are greater than average loans, average assets include an allocation of investment securities equal to the difference. Consolidated average assets include average assets of discontinued operations.
Return on Common and Tangible Common Equity/Pretax Operating Margin:
Ratios are presented for continuing operations basis only. Quarterly return on common and tangible common equity ratios are annualized.
Non-GAAP Measures:
Certain Non-GAAP measures are included in the following schedules. These measures are used by management to monitor financial performance, both on a company-wide and on a business segment basis.
