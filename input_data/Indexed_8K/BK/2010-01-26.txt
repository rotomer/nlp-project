The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 4Q09 Quarterly Earnings Review
 
NON-GAAP MEASURES
BNY Mellon has included in this review certain Non-GAAP measures based upon tangible common shareholders' equity. BNY Mellon believes that the ratio of tangible common shareholders' equity to tangible assets, is a measure of capital strength that adds additional useful information to investors, supplementing the Tier 1 capital ratio which is utilized by regulatory authorities. Unlike the Tier 1 ratio, the tangible common shareholders' equity ratio fully incorporates those changes in investment securities valuations which are reflected in shareholders' equity. In addition, this ratio is expressed as a percentage of the actual book value of assets, as opposed to a percentage of a risk-based reduced value established in accordance with regulatory requirements, although BNY Mellon in its calculation has excluded certain assets which are given a zero percent risk-weighting for regulatory purposes. This ratio is also informative to investors in BNY Mellon's common stock because, unlike the Tier 1 capital ratio, it excludes preferred stock and trust preferred securities issued by BNY Mellon. Further, BNY Mellon believes that the return on tangible common equity measure, which excludes goodwill and intangible assets net of deferred tax liabilities, is a useful additional measure for investors because it presents a measure of BNY Mellon's performance in reference to those assets which are productive in generating income.
BNY Mellon has provided the measure of tangible book value per share, which it believes provides additional useful information as to the level of such assets in relation to shares of common stock outstanding. BNY Mellon has presented revenue measures which exclude the effect of investment securities gains (losses) and expense, pre-tax income and net income measures excluding items, such as merger and integration ("M&I") expenses, intangible amortization expenses, support agreement charges, asset-based taxes, the FDIC special assessment, investment securities gains (losses), discrete tax benefits and the benefit of tax settlements. Return on equity measures and operating margin measures which exclude some or all of these items are also presented. BNY Mellon believes that these measures are useful to investors because they permit a focus on period to period comparisons which relate to the ability of BNY Mellon to enhance revenues and limit expenses in circumstances where such matters are within BNY Mellon's control. The excluded items in general relate to situations where accounting rules require certain ongoing charges as a result of prior transactions, or where valuation or other accounting/regulatory requirements require charges unrelated to operational initiatives. M&I expenses relate to our Corporate Trust acquisition in 2006 and to the merger with Mellon Financial Corporation in 2007. M&I expenses generally continue for approximately three years after the transaction, and can vary on a year-to-year basis depending on the stage of the integration. BNY Mellon believes that the exclusion of M&I expenses provides investors with a focus on BNY Mellon's business as it would appear on a consolidated going-forward basis, after such M&I expenses have ceased, typically after approximately three years. Future periods will not reflect such M&I expenses, and thus may be more easily compared to our current results if M&I expenses are excluded. With regards to the exclusion of investment securities losses, BNY Mellon's primary businesses are Asset and Wealth Management and Institutional Services. The management of these sectors is evaluated on the basis of the ability of these businesses to generate fee and net interest revenue and to control expenses, and not on the results of BNY Mellon's investment securities portfolio. Management of the investment securities portfolio is a shared service contained in the Other segment. The primary objective of the investment securities portfolio is to generate net interest revenue from the liquidity generated by BNY Mellon's processing businesses. BNY Mellon does not generally originate or trade the securities in the investment securities portfolio. As a result, BNY Mellon believes that presenting measures which exclude investment securities losses from its results, as a supplement to GAAP information, gives investors a clearer picture of the results of its primary businesses. Restructuring charges relate to migrating positions to global growth centers and the elimination of certain positions. Discrete tax benefits relate to a tax loss on mortgages. Excluding these benefits permits investors to calculate the tax impact for BNY Mellon's primary businesses.
In this earnings review, certain amounts are presented on an FTE basis. We believe that this presentation provides comparability of amounts arising from both taxable and tax exempt sources, and is consistent with industry practice. The adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income.
Each of these measures as described above is used by management to monitor financial performance, both on a company-wide and on a business segment basis. Below is a listing of certain financial measures which have been impacted by the exclusion and/or adjustment of certain items.
Revenue: Investment securities gains (losses).
Noninterest expense: M&I expenses; intangible amortization expense, support agreement charges, FDIC special assessment and restructuring charges.
Earnings per share: Investment securities gains (losses), M&I expenses, restructuring charges, FDIC special assessment, support agreement charges, intangible amortization expense, discrete tax benefits and the benefit of tax settlements.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO
At Dec. 31, 2009, the fair value of our investment securities portfolio totaled $55.9 billion. The unrealized pre-tax loss on our securities portfolio was $1.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2009 compared with $1.4 billion at Sept. 30, 2009 and $7.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2008.
In the fourth quarter of 2009, we securitized $5.0 billion, fair value, of our investment securities portfolio into a Grantor Trust. The Grantor Trust contains Alt-A, prime and subprime RMBS which were previously written down to fair value as part of the 3Q09 restructuring of the investment securities portfolio. As a result of this transaction, we received $771 million in cash for a Class A senior tranche that was sold to third parties and retained Class B certificates with a fair value of $4.2 billion, which is included in the tables below. The transaction resulted in a $39 million net loss in the fourth quarter of 2009, which was offset by $54 million of net gains on the sale of $3.6 billion of investment securities. The following table presents the fourth quarter 2009 activity related to restructuring and reducing risk in the investment securities portfolio.

RESTRUCTURING CHARGE
As part of an ongoing effort to improve efficiency and develop a global operating model that provides the highest quality of service to our clients, BNY Mellon continues to execute its global location strategy. This strategy includes migrating positions to our global growth centers and the elimination of certain positions.
In December 2009, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $139 million, or $0.07 per common share. This charge was comprised of $102 million for severance costs and $37 million for asset write-offs and other costs. The restructuring charge is recorded as a separate line on the income statement.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND OTHER TRADING ACTIVITIES REVENUE
 
 
CAPITAL
 
NONPERFORMING ASSETS
 
Nonperforming assets decreased $10 million compared with Sept. 30, 2009. The decrease primarily resulted from repayments and charge-offs, partially offset by additions of $14 million to a metal fabricating company and $9 million from residential mortgages.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PROVISION AND NET CHARGE-OFFS
 
The provision for credit losses was $65 million in 4Q09 compared with $147 million in 3Q09. The decrease in the provision reflects a lower number of downgrades in the fourth quarter of 2009. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the total allowance for credit losses increased $32 million and net charge-offs totaled $33 million.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In the second quarter of 2009, we adopted discontinued operations accounting for Mellon United National Bank located in Florida. It was determined that this business no longer fit our strategic focus on our asset management and securities servicing businesses. In July 2009, we signed a definitive agreement to sell Mellon United National Bank. The transaction was completed on Jan. 15, 2010. This business was formerly included in the Other segment. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded an after-tax loss on discontinued operations of $119 million largely related to additional write-downs primarily for retained South Florida real estate loans. The value of these loans, which are carried at the lower of cost or market, was $383 million (face value $635 million) at Dec. 31, 2009. The after-tax loss of $270 million for the full-year of 2009 primarily reflects the loan write-downs and the elimination of $82 million of goodwill recorded in the second quarter of 2009.

Financial Trends
Notes:
On July 1, 2007, The Bank of New York Company, Inc. ("The Bank of New York") and Mellon Financial Corporation ("Mellon") merged with and into The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation ("The Bank of New York Mellon" or " BNY Mellon"), with BNY Mellon being the surviving entity ("the merger").
The results prior to the consummation of the merger reflect the sum of The Bank of New York and Mellon's historical results, but do not include the pro forma impact of purchase accounting adjustments. Combined results for the periods prior to the merger (1Q07, 2Q07) are presented on a pre-tax basis only. Average common equity and average goodwill/intangibles are not disclosed for the periods prior to the merger due to the impact of the merger on these line items. The business segment results are presented on a pre-tax basis for all periods and reflect actions taken to report consistent transfer pricing and cost allocation methodologies as well as intercompany eliminations between The Bank of New York and Mellon.
Summations may not equal due to rounding. As a result of this rounding convention, immaterial differences may exist between the segment trends data versus segment data on the Form 10-K for the quarter ended December 31, 2009.
The following transactions/changes have impacted the reporting of our results:
On November 2, 2009, we completed the acquisition of Insight Asset Management ("Insight") based in London. The financial results for Insight are included in the fourth quarter 2009 results of the Asset Management segment.
On June 30, 2009, we adopted discontinued operations accounting for Mellon United National Bank (MUNB) located in Miami, Florida. Previously, the financial results were included in the Other segment. The financial results for all periods were restated.
On January 1, 2009, we adopted FAS 160, which resulted in a reclassification of minority interest to equity from other liabilities on the balance sheet and to noncontrolling interest from other expense on the income statement.
During the first quarter of 2009, we moved the financial results of the Execution business from the Clearing Services segment to the Other segment. Historical segment results have been restated to reflect these changes.
On June 3, 2008, we completed the sale of Mellon 1st Business Bank, National Association (N.A.). We moved the financial results from the Wealth Management segment to the Other segment. Historical segment results have been restated to reflect these changes.
On December 20, 2007, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in the ABN AMRO Mellon joint venture. The financial results are included in the Asset Servicing segment.
The following items have impacted the reporting of our results:
Investment Securities Portfolio restructuring/ Investment Write-downs  Impacted total revenue levels in the fourth quarter of 2007, full year of 2008, and full year of 2009.
The TARP preferred dividends and related redemption premium impacted the fourth quarter of 2008, and the first and second quarters of 2009.
The FDIC Special Assessment of all depository institutions impacted the second quarter of 2009.
Global efficiency restructuring charges  Recorded charges in the fourth quarters of 2008 and 2009.
SILO/LILO/Tax settlement charges  Incurred charges in the second and third quarters of 2008, while the second quarter of 2009 contains the benefit of final tax settlements.
Merger & integration/Intangible amortization expenses  Both expense categories increased beginning in the second/third quarters of 2007 as a result of the merger.
Support agreement charges  Recorded a $163 million pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2008 and a $726 million pre-tax charge in the third quarter of 2008 (minor amounts recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007, first and second quarters of 2008 and full year of 2009).
All of these items are detailed in the trends that follow.
Discontinued Operations Accounting:
The income/(loss) and average assets from discontinued operations accounting have not been allocated to any segment.
Average Assets:
In business segments where average deposits are greater than average loans, average assets include an allocation of investment securities equal to the difference. Consolidated average assets include average assets of discontinued operations.
Return on Common and Tangible Common Equity/Pretax Operating Margin:
Ratios are presented for continuing operations basis only. Quarterly return on common and tangible common equity ratios are annualized.
Non-GAAP Measures:
Certain Non-GAAP measures are included in the following schedules. These measures are used by management to monitor financial performance, both on a company-wide and on a business segment basis.
