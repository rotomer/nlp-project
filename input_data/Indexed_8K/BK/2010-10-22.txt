Exhibit 99.1
 
BNY Mellon 3Q10 Quarterly Earnings Review
 
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
BNY Mellon has included in this Earnings Review certain Non-GAAP measures based upon tangible common shareholders' equity. BNY Mellon believes that the ratio of tangible common shareholders' equity to tangible assets of operations, is a measure of capital strength that adds additional useful information to investors, supplementing the Tier 1 capital ratio which is utilized by regulatory authorities. Unlike the Tier 1 capital ratio, the tangible common shareholders' equity ratio fully incorporates those changes in investment securities valuations which are reflected in shareholders' equity. In addition, this ratio is expressed as a percentage of the actual book value of assets, as opposed to a percentage of a risk-based reduced value established in accordance with regulatory requirements, although BNY Mellon in its calculation has excluded certain assets which are given a zero percent risk-weighting for regulatory purposes. This ratio is also informative to investors in BNY Mellon's common stock because, unlike the Tier 1 capital ratio, it excludes trust preferred securities issued by BNY Mellon. Further, BNY Mellon believes that the return on tangible common equity measure, which excludes goodwill and intangible assets net of deferred tax liabilities, is a useful additional measure for investors because it presents a measure of BNY Mellon's performance in reference to those assets which are productive in generating income.
BNY Mellon has provided the measure of tangible book value per share, which it believes provides additional useful information as to the level of such assets in relation to shares of common stock outstanding. BNY Mellon has presented revenue measures which exclude the effect of net securities gains (losses) and noncontrolling interests related to consolidated asset management funds and expense measures excluding items, such as merger and integration ("M&I") expenses, intangible amortization expenses, special litigation reserves taken in the first quarter of 2010; and measures which utilize net income excluding tax items such as the discrete tax benefits related to a tax loss on mortgages and the benefit of tax settlements. Return on equity measures and operating margin measures which exclude some or all of these items are also presented. BNY Mellon believes that these measures are useful to investors because they permit a focus on period to period comparisons which relate to the ability of BNY Mellon to enhance revenues and limit expenses in circumstances where such matters are within BNY Mellon's control. The excluded items in general relate to situations where accounting rules require certain ongoing charges as a result of prior transactions, or where valuation or other accounting/regulatory requirements require charges unrelated to operational initiatives. M&I expenses primarily relate to the acquisitions of GIS and BAS in the third quarter of 2010 and the merger with Mellon Financial Corporation in 2007. M&I expenses generally continue for approximately three years after the transaction, and can vary on a year-to-year basis depending on the stage of the integration. BNY Mellon believes that the exclusion of M&I expenses provides investors with a focus on BNY Mellon's business as it would appear on a consolidated going-forward basis, after such M&I expenses have ceased, typically after approximately three years. Future periods will not reflect such M&I expenses, and thus may be more easily compared to our current results if M&I expenses are excluded. With regards to the exclusion of net investment securities gains (losses), BNY Mellon's primary businesses are Asset and Wealth Management and Institutional Services. The management of these businesses is evaluated on the basis of the ability of these businesses to generate fee and net interest revenue and to control expenses, and not on the results of BNY Mellon's investment securities portfolio. The investment securities portfolio is managed within the Other group of businesses. The primary objective of the investment securities portfolio is to generate net interest revenue from the liquidity generated by BNY Mellon's processing businesses. BNY Mellon does not generally originate or trade the securities in the investment securities portfolio. With regards to higher yields related to the restructured investment securities portfolio, client deposits serve as the primary funding source for our investment securities portfolio and we typically allocate all interest revenue to the businesses generating the deposits. Accordingly, the higher yield related to the restructured investment securities portfolio has been included in the results of our businesses. The presentation of financial measures excluding special litigation reserves taken in the first quarter of 2010 provides investors the ability to view performance metrics on the basis that management views results. The presentation of income of consolidated asset management funds, net of noncontrolling interest related to the consolidation of certain assets management funds permits investors to view revenue on a basis consistent with prior periods. Restructuring charges relate to migrating positions to global growth centers and the elimination of certain positions. Excluding the discrete tax benefits related to a tax loss on mortgages permits investors to calculate the tax impact of BNY Mellon's primary businesses. BNY Mellon believes that these presentations, as a supplement to GAAP information, gives investors a clearer picture of the results of its primary businesses.
In this Earnings Review, certain amounts are presented on an FTE basis. We believe that this presentation provides comparability of amounts arising from both taxable and tax exempt sources, and is consistent with industry practice. The adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income.
Each of these measures as described above is used by management to monitor financial performance, both on a company-wide and on a business-level basis. Below is a listing of certain financial measures which have been impacted by the exclusion and/or adjustment of certain items.

OPERATIONS OF CONSOLIDATED ASSET MANAGEMENT FUNDS
On Jan. 1, 2010, we adopted ASC 810 (SFAS No. 167). Adoption of this standard resulted in an increase in consolidated total assets on our balance sheet at Sept. 30, 2010 of $14.5 billion, or approximately 7% from Dec. 31, 2009.
We also separately disclosed the following on the income statement.
 
These line items were previously disclosed on the income statement as:

INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO
At Sept. 30, 2010, the fair value of our investment securities portfolio totaled $62 billion. The unrealized pre-tax gain on our total securities portfolio was $643 million at Sept. 30, 2010 compared with $292 million at June 30, 2010 and an unrealized pre-tax loss of $1.4 billion at Sept. 30, 2009.
The following table shows the distribution of our investment securities portfolio.

CAPITAL
 
The sequential decrease in the capital ratios primarily resulted from the Acquisitions, partially offset by the issuance of $677 million (25.9 million shares) of common equity via a forward sale agreement that settled in mid-September 2010 and earnings retention. The Acquisitions, net of the equity raise, reduced the Tier 1 and Tier 1 common ratios by approximately 185 basis points and the tangible common shareholders' equity ratio by approximately 100 basis points.
NONPERFORMING ASSETS

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PROVISION AND NET CHARGE-OFFS
 
The provision for credit losses was a credit of $22 million in the third quarter of 2010 compared with a charge of $20 million in the second quarter of 2010 and a charge of $147 million in the third quarter of 2009. The decrease in the provision year-over-year and sequentially reflects a decline of 26% in criticized assets during the third quarter of 2010. During the third quarter of 2010, the total allowance for credit losses decreased $37 million and net charge-offs totaled $15 million.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
On Jan. 15, 2010, BNY Mellon sold Mellon United National Bank ("MUNB"), its national bank subsidiary located in Florida. We have applied discontinued operations accounting to this business. The income statements for all periods in this Earnings Review are presented on a continuing operations basis. In the third quarter of 2010, we recorded an after-tax loss on discontinued operations of $3 million primarily reflecting lower of cost or market write-downs on the retained loans held for sale.
REVIEW OF BUSINESSES
See BNY Mellon's 2009 Annual Report for information on the accounting principles of our businesses. In addition, client deposits serve as the primary funding source for our investment securities portfolio and we typically allocate all interest revenue to the businesses generating the deposits. Accordingly, the higher yield related to the restructured investment securities portfolio has been included in the results of our businesses.

Financial Trends
Notes:
On July 1, 2007, The Bank of New York Company, Inc. ("The Bank of New York") and Mellon Financial Corporation ("Mellon") merged with and into The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation ("The Bank of New York Mellon" or " BNY Mellon"), with BNY Mellon being the surviving entity ("the merger").
The results prior to the consummation of the merger reflect the sum of The Bank of New York and Mellon's historical results, but do not include the pro forma impact of purchase accounting adjustments. Combined results for the periods prior to the merger (1Q07, 2Q07) are presented on a pre-tax basis only. Average common equity and average goodwill/intangibles are not disclosed for the periods prior to the merger due to the impact of the merger on these line items. The business results are presented on a pre-tax basis for all periods and reflect actions taken to report consistent transfer pricing and cost allocation methodologies as well as intercompany eliminations between The Bank of New York and Mellon.
Summations may not equal due to rounding. As a result of this rounding convention, immaterial differences may exist between the business trends data versus business data on the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2010.
Certain immaterial reclassifications have been made to prior periods to place them on a basis comparable with the current periods presentation.
The following transactions/changes have impacted the reporting of our results:
On July 1, 2010 and August 2, 2010 we completed the acquisitions of Global Investment Servicing ("GIS") and BHF Asset Servicing GmbH ("BAS"). The financial results for GIS are included in the Asset Servicing, Clearing Services and Treasury Services businesses. The financial results for BAS are included in the Asset Servicing business.
On Jan. 1, 2010, we adopted SFAS No. 167, "Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46 (R)." Certain asset management funds and seed capital investments are now disclosed separately on our balance sheet and securitizations are included in available for sale securities. The income statement separately discloses the operations of consolidated asset management funds and the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated asset management funds; previously these were disclosed as asset and wealth management revenue and investment income.
On November 2, 2009, we completed the acquisition of Insight Asset Management ("Insight") based in London. The financial results for Insight are included in the Asset Management business.
On June 30, 2009, we adopted discontinued operations accounting for Mellon United National Bank (MUNB) located in Miami, Florida. Previously, the financial results were included in the Other business. On January 15, 2010, we completed the sale of MUNB. The financial results for all periods were restated.
On January 1, 2009, we adopted FAS 160, which resulted in a reclassification of minority interest to equity from other liabilities on the balance sheet and to noncontrolling interest from other expense on the income statement.
During the first quarter of 2009, we moved the financial results of the Execution business from the Clearing Services business to the Other business. Historical business results have been restated to reflect these changes.
On June 3, 2008, we completed the sale of Mellon 1st Business Bank, National Association (N.A.). We moved the financial results from the Wealth Management business to the Other business. Historical results have been restated to reflect these changes.
On December 20, 2007, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in the ABN AMRO Mellon joint venture. The financial results are included in the Asset Servicing business.
The following items have impacted the reporting of our results:
Results for the first quarter of 2010 include a charge related to special litigation reserves.
Investment Securities Portfolio restructuring/ Investment Write-downs  Impacted total revenue levels in the fourth quarter of 2007, full year of 2008, and full year of 2009.
