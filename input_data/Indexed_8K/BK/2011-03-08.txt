(e) On March 2, 2011, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (the "Corporation") and Mr. Robert P. Kelly, the Corporation's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, agreed to freeze the level of Mr. Kelly's supplemental executive retirement plan benefits. As amended, the benefits Mr. Kelly may receive under the supplemental plan will be limited to the amount calculated on the basis of his employment through 2012; accordingly, Mr. Kelly will not receive credit for service under the plan after 2012. Furthermore, the Corporation and Mr. Kelly agreed that the total amount of benefits that Mr. Kelly would receive under the plan would be reduced by 5%, assuming benefits commence on or after age 60, which is the earliest age at which unreduced benefits are payable. The actual amounts payable will depend on a number of factors, including Mr. Kelly's future salary and bonus amounts through 2012 and his future service with the Corporation.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
