With respect to management proposal 3, the advisory (non-binding) vote regarding the frequency of a stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation, one year received the favorable majority of the votes cast. Stockholder proposal 7 was not approved. The proposals below are described in detail in BNY Mellon's Proxy Statement, dated March 11, 2011 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
