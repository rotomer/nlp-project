BNY Mellon 1Q11 Quarterly Earnings Review
 
 
ORGANIZATION OF OUR BUSINESSES
In the first quarter of 2011, BNY Mellon realigned its internal reporting structure and business presentation to focus on its two principal businesses, Investment Management and Investment Services. The realignment reflects management's current approach to assessing performance and decisions regarding resource allocations. Investment Management includes the former Asset Management and Wealth Management businesses. Investment Services includes the former Asset Servicing, Issuer Services and Clearing Services businesses as well as the Cash Management business previously included in the Treasury Services business. The credit-related activities previously included in the Treasury Services business, are now included in the Other segment. Accordingly, the income statement has been changed to reflect this realignment. The following are the changes to the income statement:
 
 
All prior periods have been reclassified. The reclassifications did not affect the results of operations.
Also, in the first quarter of 2011, we revised the net interest revenue for our businesses to reflect a new approach to transfer pricing domestic deposits. All prior period business results have been restated to reflect this revision. This revision did not impact the consolidated results.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO
At March 31, 2011, the fair value of our investment securities portfolio totaled $66.4 billion. The unrealized pre-tax net gain on our total securities portfolio was $569 million at March 31, 2011 compared with a pre-tax net gain of $353 million at Dec. 31, 2010 and an unrealized pre-tax net loss of $247 million at March 31, 2010. The investment securities previously included in the former Grantor Trust were marked down to approximately 60% of face value in 2009. At March 31, 2011, these securities were trading above adjusted amortized cost with a total unrealized pre-tax gain of $823 million.
The following table shows the distribution of our investment securities portfolio.
 
CAPITAL
 
We continued our strong capital generation in 1Q11. Our Tier 1 common equity increased $798 million, or 7%, compared with Dec. 31, 2010, primarily driven by earnings retention.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION  EXPLANATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
BNY Mellon has included in this Earnings Review certain Non-GAAP measures based upon tangible common shareholders' equity. BNY Mellon believes that the ratio of tangible common shareholders' equity to tangible assets of operations is a measure of capital strength that adds additional useful information to investors, supplementing the Tier 1 and Total capital ratios which are utilized by regulatory authorities. Unlike the Tier 1 capital ratio, the tangible common shareholders' equity ratio fully incorporates those changes in investment securities valuations which are reflected in shareholders' equity. In addition, this ratio is expressed as a percentage of the actual book value of assets, as opposed to a percentage of a risk-based reduced value established in accordance with regulatory requirements, although BNY Mellon in its calculation has excluded certain assets which are given a zero percent risk-weighting for regulatory purposes. This ratio is also informative to investors in BNY Mellon's common stock because, unlike the Tier 1 capital ratio, it excludes trust preferred securities issued by BNY Mellon. Further, BNY Mellon believes that the return on tangible common equity measure, which excludes goodwill and intangible assets net of deferred tax liabilities, is a useful additional measure for investors because it presents a measure of BNY Mellon's performance in reference to those assets which are productive in generating income.
BNY Mellon has provided the measure of tangible book value per share, which it believes provides additional useful information as to the level of such assets in relation to shares of common stock outstanding. BNY Mellon has presented revenue measures which exclude the effect of net securities gains and expense measures excluding items, such as merger and integration ("M&I") expenses, amortization of intangible assets expenses and special litigation reserves taken in the first quarter of 2010. Return on equity measures and operating margin measures which exclude some or all of these items are also presented. The presentation of financial measures excluding special litigation reserves taken in the first quarter of 2010 provides investors the ability to view performance metrics on the basis that management views results. The presentation of income of consolidated investment management funds, net of noncontrolling interest related to the consolidation of certain asset management funds permits investors to view revenue on a basis consistent with prior periods. BNY Mellon believes that these measures are useful to investors because they permit a focus on period to period comparisons which relate to the ability of BNY Mellon to enhance revenues and limit expenses in circumstances where such matters are within BNY Mellon's control. The excluded items in general relate to situations where accounting rules require certain ongoing charges as a result of prior transactions, or where we have incurred charges unrelated to operational initiatives. M&I expenses primarily relate to the Acquisitions which were consummated in the third quarter of 2010 and the merger with Mellon Financial Corporation in 2007. M&I expenses generally continue for approximately three years after the transaction, and can vary on a year-to-year basis depending on the stage of the integration. BNY Mellon believes that the exclusion of M&I expenses provides investors with a focus on BNY Mellon's business as it would appear on a consolidated going-forward basis, after such M&I expenses have ceased, typically after approximately three years. Future periods will not reflect such M&I expenses, and thus may be more easily compared to our current results if M&I expenses are excluded. With regards to the exclusion of net securities gains, BNY Mellon's primary businesses are Investment Management and Investment Services. The management of these businesses is evaluated on the basis of the ability of these businesses to generate fee and net interest revenue and to control expenses, and not on the results of BNY Mellon's investment securities portfolio. The investment securities portfolio is managed within the Other group of businesses. The primary objective of the investment securities portfolio is to generate net interest revenue from the liquidity generated by BNY Mellon's processing businesses. BNY Mellon does not generally originate or trade the securities in the investment securities portfolio. With regards to higher yields related to the restructured investment securities portfolio, client deposits serve as the primary funding source for our investment securities portfolio and we typically allocate all interest revenue to the businesses generating the deposits. Accordingly, the higher yield related to the restructured investment securities portfolio has been included in the results of our businesses. The presentation of financial measures excluding special litigation reserves taken in the first quarter of 2010 provides investors the ability to view performance metrics on the basis that management views results. The presentation of income of consolidated investment management funds, net of noncontrolling interest related to the consolidation of certain assets management funds permits investors to view revenue on a basis consistent with prior periods. Restructuring charges relate to migrating positions to global growth centers and the elimination of certain positions. Excluding these charges permits investors to view expenses on a basis consistent with prior

periods. BNY Mellon believes that these presentations, as a supplement to GAAP information, gives investors a clearer picture of the results of its primary businesses.
In this Earnings Review, certain amounts are presented on an FTE basis. We believe that this presentation provides comparability of amounts arising from both taxable and tax exempt sources, and is consistent with industry practice. The adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income.
Each of these measures as described above is used by management to monitor financial performance, both on a company-wide and on a business-level basis.

Financial Trends
Notes:
The following transactions/changes have impacted the reporting of our results:
On July 1, 2010 and August 2, 2010 we completed the acquisitions of Global Investment Servicing ("GIS") and BHF Asset Servicing GmbH ("BAS"). The financial results for GIS are included in the Investment Services and Other businesses. The financial results for BAS are included in the Investment Services business.
On Jan. 1, 2010, we adopted SFAS No. 167, "Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46 (R)." Certain asset management funds and seed capital investments are now disclosed separately on our balance sheet and securitizations are included in available for sale securities. The income statement separately discloses the operations of consolidated asset management funds and the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated asset management funds; previously these were disclosed as asset and wealth management revenue and investment and other income.
On November 2, 2009, we completed the acquisition of Insight Asset Management ("Insight") based in London. The financial results for Insight are included in the Investment Management business.
On January 1, 2009, we adopted FAS 160, which resulted in a reclassification of minority interest to equity from other liabilities on the balance sheet and to noncontrolling interest from other expense on the income statement.
In the first quarter of 2011, we realigned our internal reporting structure and business presentation to focus on two principal businesses, Investment Management and Investment Services. Investment Management includes the former Asset Management and Wealth Management businesses. Investment Services includes the former Asset Servicing, Issuer Services and Clearing Services businesses as well as the Cash Management business previously included in the Treasury Services business. The credit-related activities previously included in Treasury Services business, are now included in the Other segment. Accordingly, the income statement has been changed to reflect this realignment. Investment management and performance fees consist of the former asset and wealth management fee revenue and Investment services fees consist of the former securities servicing fees, including asset servicing, issuer services, clearing services, as well as treasury services fee revenue. All prior periods have been reclassified. The reclassifications did not affect the results of operations.
In the first quarter of 2011, we revised the net interest revenue for our businesses to reflect a new approach to transfer pricing domestic deposits. All prior period business results have been restated to reflect this revision. The revision did not impact consolidated results.
The following items have impacted the comparability of our results:
Results for the first quarter of 2010 include a charge related to special litigation reserves.
Investment Securities Portfolio restructuring/Investment Write-downs  Impacted total revenue levels in the full year of 2008 and full year of 2009.
The TARP preferred dividends and related redemption premium impacted the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first and second quarters of 2009.
The FDIC Special Assessment of all depository institutions impacted the second quarter of 2009.
Global efficiency restructuring charges  Recorded charges in the fourth quarters of 2008 and 2009 and third quarter of 2010.
All of these items are detailed in the trends that follow.
Summations may not equal due to rounding. As a result of this rounding convention, immaterial differences may exist between the business trends data versus business data on the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to place them on a basis comparable with the current periods presentation.
Discontinued Operations Accounting:
The income/(loss) and average assets from discontinued operations accounting have not been allocated to any business.
Average Assets:
In businesses where average deposits are greater than average loans, average assets include an allocation of investment securities equal to the difference. Consolidated average assets include average assets of discontinued operations.
Return on Common and Tangible Common Equity/Pretax Operating Margin:
Ratios are presented for continuing operations basis only. Quarterly return on common and tangible common equity ratios are annualized.
Non-GAAP Measures:
Certain Non-GAAP measures are included in the following schedules. These measures are used by management to monitor financial performance, both on a company-wide and on a business basis. These Non-GAAP measures impact certain revenue/expense categories, percentages and ratios by the exclusion and/or adjustment of items listed above and described in footnotes. For further information, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures' and Supplemental Information  Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures' in The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Quarterly Earnings Review dated April 19th, 2011, furnished as an exhibit to the Report on Form 8-K to which these Financial Trends are furnished as an exhibit.
