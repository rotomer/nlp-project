BNY MELLON REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS OF $735 MILLION OR $0.59 PER SHARE
VERSUS SECOND QUARTER 2010:
 
 
 
GENERATED $803 MILLION OF TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY IN 2Q11
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation ("BNY Mellon") (NYSE:BK) today reported second quarter net income applicable to common shareholders of $735 million, or $0.59 per common share, compared with net income applicable to common shareholders of $658 million, or $0.54 per common share, in the second quarter of 2010 and net income applicable to common shareholders of $625 million, or $0.50 per common share, in the first quarter of 2011.
NEW YORK, July 19, 2011 
"Fees and net interest revenue grew nicely over both the prior year and quarter, leading to EPS growth of 9% and 18%, respectively. Expense growth remained high due in part to legal and regulatory costs. We are taking additional actions to reduce expenses," said Robert P. Kelly, chairman and chief executive officer of BNY Mellon.
"Our balance sheet remains very strong, deposits grew substantially and our capital ratios rose after our dividend increase and stock repurchases," added Mr. Kelly.

The lower tax rate in the second quarter of 2011 was due primarily to the impact of the consolidated investment management funds. Adjusted for the impact of the consolidated investment management funds, the effective tax rate on an operating basis (non-GAAP) was 30.0% in the second quarter of 2011, compared with 30.8% in the second quarter of 2010 and 30.2% in the first quarter of 2011.

We generated $803 million of Basel I Tier 1 common equity in the second quarter of 2011, primarily driven by earnings retention.
In the second quarter of 2011, we increased our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio by approximately 45 basis points, reflecting our strong capital generation and improving risk-weighted assets mix. Given the strength of our balance sheet and ability to rapidly grow capital, we do not anticipate accelerating our timeline to meet the proposed Basel III capital guidelines.
 On July 19, 2011, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.13 per common share. This cash dividend is payable on Aug. 9, 2011 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on July 29, 2011.

Supplemental information  Explanation of Non-GAAP financial measures
BNY Mellon has included in this release certain Non-GAAP financial measures based upon tangible common shareholders' equity. BNY Mellon believes that the ratio of tangible common shareholders' equity to tangible assets of operations is a measure of capital strength that provides additional useful information to investors, supplementing the Tier 1 and Total capital ratios which are utilized by regulatory authorities. Unlike the Tier 1 and Total capital ratios, the tangible common shareholders' equity ratio fully incorporates those changes in investment securities valuations which are reflected in total shareholders' equity. In addition, this ratio is expressed as a percentage of the actual book value of assets, as opposed to a percentage of a risk-based reduced value established in accordance with regulatory requirements, although BNY Mellon in its calculation has excluded certain assets which are given a zero percent risk-weighting for regulatory purposes. This ratio is also informative to investors in BNY Mellon's common stock because, unlike the Tier 1 capital ratio, it excludes trust preferred securities issued by BNY Mellon. Further, BNY Mellon believes that the return on tangible common equity measure, which excludes goodwill and intangible assets net of deferred tax liabilities, is a useful additional measure for investors because it presents a measure of BNY Mellon's performance in reference to those assets which are productive in generating income. BNY Mellon has presented its estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio on a basis that is representative of how it currently understands the Basel III rules. Management views the Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio as a key measure in monitoring BNY Mellon's capital position. Additionally, the presentation of the Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio permits investors the ability to compare BNY Mellon's Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio with estimates presented by other companies.
BNY Mellon has provided a measure of tangible book value per share, which it believes provides additional useful information as to the level of such assets in relation to shares of common stock outstanding. BNY Mellon has presented revenue measures which exclude the effect of net securities gains; and expense measures which exclude special litigation reserves taken in the first quarter of 2010, restructuring charges, M&I expenses and amortization of intangible assets expenses. Operating margin measures, which exclude some or all of these items, are also presented. Operating margin measures also exclude noncontrolling interests related to consolidated investment management funds. BNY Mellon believes that these measures are useful to investors because they permit a focus on period to period comparisons which relate to the ability of BNY Mellon to enhance revenues and limit expenses in circumstances where such matters are within BNY Mellon's control. The excluded items in general relate to situations where accounting rules require certain ongoing charges as a result of prior transactions, or where we have incurred charges unrelated to operational initiatives. M&I expenses primarily relate to the Acquisitions in 2010 and the merger with Mellon Financial Corporation in 2007. M&I expenses generally continue for approximately three years after the transaction and can vary on a year-to-year basis depending on the stage of the integration. BNY Mellon believes that the exclusion of M&I expenses provides investors with a focus on BNY Mellon's business as it would appear on a consolidated going-forward basis, after such M&I expenses have ceased, typically after approximately three years. Future periods will not reflect such M&I expenses, and thus may be more easily compared to our current results if M&I expenses are excluded. With regards to the exclusion of net securities gains, BNY Mellon's primary businesses are Investment Management and Investment Services. The management of these businesses is evaluated on the basis of the ability of these businesses to generate fee and net interest revenue and to control expenses, and not on the results of BNY Mellon's investment securities portfolio. The investment securities portfolio is managed within the Other segment. The primary objective of the investment securities portfolio is to generate net interest revenue from the liquidity generated by BNY Mellon's processing businesses. BNY Mellon does not generally originate or trade the securities in the investment securities portfolio. The presentation of financial measures excluding special litigation reserves taken in the first quarter of 2010 provides investors the ability to view performance metrics on the basis that management views results. The presentation of income of consolidated investment management funds, net of noncontrolling interest related to the consolidation of certain investment management funds, permits
 
investors to view revenue on a basis consistent with how management views the business. Restructuring charges relate to migrating positions to global growth centers and the elimination of certain positions. Excluding these charges permits investors to view expenses on a basis consistent with how management views the business. BNY Mellon believes that these presentations, as a supplement to GAAP information, give investors a clearer picture of the results of its primary businesses.
In this Earnings Release, certain amounts are presented on an FTE basis. We believe that this presentation provides comparability of amounts arising from both taxable and tax exempt sources, and is consistent with industry practice. The adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income.
Each of these measures as described above is used by management to monitor financial performance, both on a company-wide and business-level basis.
