ITEM 5.07. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.
At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation ("BNY Mellon") on April 10, 2012, each nominee for director was elected by a majority of votes cast. Management proposals 2 and 3 were approved. Stockholder proposals 4 and 5 were not approved. The proposals below are described in detail in BNY Mellon's definitive proxy statement, dated March 9, 2012, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Abstentions and broker non-votes were counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum was present, but were not treated as votes cast on a proposal. Therefore, broker non-votes and abstentions did not have the effect of a vote for or against the proposal and were not counted in determining the number of votes required for approval.
The results are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
* Abstentions and broker non-votes are not counted as votes cast.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
