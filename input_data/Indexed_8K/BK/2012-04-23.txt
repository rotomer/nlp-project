On April 18, 2012, the Registrant conducted a conference call and webcast with respect to results of operations for first quarter 2012 for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation. In conjunction with the conference call and webcast, the Registrant made available on its website, beginning on April 18, 2012, a Quarterly Earnings Review and Financial Trends information. The Quarterly Earnings Review is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and the Financial Trends information is included as Exhibit 99.2 to this report. Both exhibits are "furnished" pursuant to General Instruction B.2. of Form 8-K and are not "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not incorporated by reference into any filings the Registrant has made or may make under the Securities Act of 1933.
 
Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 to this report contain information which may be considered to constitute "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K. The Registrant's management believes that these measures are useful to the investment community in analyzing the financial results and trends of ongoing operations. Management believes that they facilitate comparisons with prior periods and reflect the principal basis on which management monitors financial performance. Management also believes this presentation allows investors to more appropriately evaluate the impact of revenues from both taxable and tax-exempt sources.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

Foreign exchange and other trading revenue totaled $191 million compared with $198 million in the first quarter of 2011 and $228 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. In the first quarter of 2012, foreign exchange revenue totaled $136 million, a decrease of 21% year-over-year and 26% (unannualized) sequentially. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower volumes and volatility, while sequentially, volumes were unchanged and volatility decreased 20%. Other trading revenue was $55 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared with $25 million in the first quarter of 2011 and $45 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Both increases were primarily driven by higher fixed income trading.

CAPITAL
 
We generated $680 million of gross Basel I Tier 1 common equity in the first quarter of 2012.
Our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio  Non-GAAP was 7.6% at March 31, 2012 compared with 7.1% at Dec. 31, 2011 and 6.1% at March 31, 2011. The sequential improvement in the ratio was driven by an increase in the value of our investment securities portfolio, earnings retention and lower risk-weighted assets, partially offset by share repurchases.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION  EXPLANATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
BNY Mellon has included in this Earnings Review certain Non-GAAP financial measures based upon tangible common shareholders' equity. BNY Mellon believes that the ratio of Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets and the ratio of tangible common shareholders' equity to tangible assets of operations are measures of capital strength that provide additional useful information to investors, supplementing the Tier 1 and Total capital ratios which are utilized by regulatory authorities. The ratio of Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets excludes trust preferred securities, which will be phased out of Tier 1 regulatory capital beginning in 2013. Unlike the Tier 1 and Total capital ratios, the tangible common shareholders' equity ratio fully incorporates those changes in investment securities valuations which are reflected in total shareholders' equity. In addition, this ratio is expressed as a percentage of the actual book value of assets, as opposed to a percentage of a risk-based reduced value established in accordance with regulatory requirements, although BNY Mellon in its calculation has excluded certain assets which are given a zero percent risk-weighting for regulatory purposes. Further, BNY Mellon believes that the return on tangible common equity measure, which excludes goodwill and intangible assets net of deferred tax liabilities, is a useful additional measure for investors because it presents a measure of BNY Mellon's performance in reference to those assets which are productive in generating income. BNY Mellon has presented its estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio on a basis that is representative of how it currently understands the Basel III rules. Management views the Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio as a key measure in monitoring BNY Mellon's capital position. Additionally, the presentation of the Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio allows investors to compare BNY Mellon's Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio with estimates presented by other companies.
BNY Mellon has provided a measure of tangible book value per share, which it believes provides additional useful information as to the level of such assets in relation to shares of common stock outstanding. BNY Mellon has presented revenue measures which exclude the effect of net securities gains (losses) and noncontrolling interests related to consolidated investment management funds; and expense measures which exclude restructuring charges, M&I expenses and amortization of intangible assets expenses. Return on equity and operating margin measures, which exclude some or all of these items, are also presented. Operating margin measures also exclude noncontrolling interests related to consolidated investment management funds. BNY Mellon believes that these measures are useful to investors because they permit a focus on period to period comparisons which relate to the ability of BNY Mellon to enhance revenues and limit expenses in circumstances where such matters are within BNY Mellon's control. The excluded items in general relate to certain ongoing charges as a result of prior transactions, or where we have incurred charges unrelated to operational initiatives. M&I expenses primarily relate to the acquisitions of Global Investment Servicing on July 1, 2010 and BHF Asset Servicing GmbH on Aug. 2, 2010. M&I expenses generally continue for approximately three years after the transaction and can vary on a year-to-year basis depending on the stage of the integration. BNY Mellon believes that the exclusion of M&I expenses provides investors with a focus on BNY Mellon's business as it would appear on a consolidated going-forward basis, after such M&I expenses have ceased. Future periods will not reflect such M&I expenses, and thus may be more easily compared to our current results if M&I expenses are excluded. With regards to the exclusion of net securities gains (losses), BNY Mellon's primary businesses are Investment Management and Investment Services. The management of these businesses is evaluated on the basis of the ability of these businesses to generate fee and net interest revenue and to control expenses, and not on the results of BNY Mellon's investment securities portfolio. The investment securities portfolio is managed within the Other segment. The primary objective of the investment securities portfolio is to generate net interest revenue from the liquidity generated by BNY Mellon's processing businesses. BNY Mellon does not generally originate or trade the securities in the investment securities portfolio. Restructuring charges relate to our operational excellence initiatives and migrating positions to global growth centers. Excluding these charges permits investors to view expenses on a basis consistent with how management views the business.
The presentation of income (loss) of consolidated investment management funds, net of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest related to the consolidation of certain investment management funds permits investors to view revenue on a basis consistent with prior periods. BNY Mellon believes that these presentations, as a supplement to GAAP information, give investors a clearer picture of the results of its primary businesses.

In this Earnings Review, the net interest margin is presented on an FTE basis. We believe that this presentation provides comparability of amounts arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources, and is consistent with industry practice.
