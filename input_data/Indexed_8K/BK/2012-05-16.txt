Ladies and Gentlemen:
In connection with the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), of $500,100,000 aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2017 (the "Notes") of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), to be issued pursuant to an Indenture dated as of July 18, 1991, as amended by a Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 29, 2007 (so amended, the "Indenture"), between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (formerly known as Bankers Trust Company), as Trustee, and to be sold by the several selling securityholders (the "Selling Securityholders") named in a Securities Purchase and Registration Rights Agreement, dated May 10, 2012 (the "Purchase Agreement"), among the Company and the Selling Securityholders, in accordance with the Purchase Agreement, I, as counsel for the Company, have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
Upon the basis of such examination, it is my opinion that the Notes have been duly authorized and established by the Company in conformity with the Indenture, and, when the Notes have been duly prepared, executed, authenticated and issued in accordance with the Indenture and delivered against delivery by the Selling Securityholders of $500,100,000 principal amount of Remarketable 6.044% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2043 of the Company in accordance with the Purchase Agreement, the Notes will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
The foregoing opinion is limited to the federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and I am expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
I have relied as to certain matters on information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and other sources believed by me to be responsible, and I have assumed that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee, and that the signatures on all documents examined by me are genuine, assumptions which I have not independently verified.
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation
This opinion letter has been prepared to be filed by the Company as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K (the "Form 8-K"). The Form 8-K will be incorporated by reference in the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (333-167832). I assume no obligation to advise you of any changes in the foregoing subsequent to the delivery of this opinion letter.
I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion letter as Exhibit 5.1 to the Form 8-K and to the use of my name therein and in the Prospectus dated June 28, 2010, as supplemented by a Prospectus Supplement dated May 10, 2012 under the captions "Validity of the Notes" and "Validity of Securities." By giving such consent, I do not hereby admit that I am within the category of persons whose consents are required under Section 7 of the Act.

This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Selling Securityholder may otherwise have.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability except to the extent that it has been prejudiced in any material respect by such failure or from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 5 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Selling Securityholder on the other from the offering of the Senior Notes. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c)
 
above and such indemnifying party was prejudiced in a material respect by such failure, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits referred to in the immediately preceding sentence but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Selling Securityholder on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Selling Securityholder on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Selling Securityholder on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), the Selling Securityholder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the difference between the aggregate proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes sold by it and the purchase price paid by such Selling Securityholder for the Junior Notes tendered in exchange for such Senior Notes in accordance with Section 1 of the Senior Notes Purchase Agreement. The Company and the Selling Securityholder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), the Selling Securityholder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total public offering price at which the Senior Notes offered by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which the Selling Securityholder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 5 shall be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls the Selling Securityholder within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Selling Securityholder, under this Section 5 shall be in addition to any liability that the Selling Securityholder may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
6.  The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the Selling Securityholder, as set forth herein or made by them pursuant hereto, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of the Selling Securityholder or any controlling person of the Selling Securityholder, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive the resale of the Senior Notes. The provisions of Sections 4 and 5 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Annex A.

Parties to Agreement. 
 
and 6 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or the Selling Securityholder, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Annex. No purchaser of any of the Senior Notes from the Selling Securityholder shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
8. As used herein, the term "SEC business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is normally open for business, and the term "business day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday or other day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close.
