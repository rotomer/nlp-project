Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On July 18, 2012, the Registrant conducted a conference call and webcast with respect to results of operations for second quarter 2012 for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation. In conjunction with the conference call and webcast, the Registrant made available on its website, beginning on July 18, 2012, a Quarterly Earnings Review and Financial Trends information. The Quarterly Earnings Review is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and the Financial Trends information is included as Exhibit 99.2 to this report. Both exhibits are "furnished" pursuant to General Instruction B.2. of Form 8-K and are not "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not incorporated by reference into any filings the Registrant has made or may make under the Securities Act of 1933.
 
Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 to this report contain information which may be considered to constitute "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K. The Registrant's management believes that these measures are useful to the investment community in analyzing the financial results and trends of ongoing operations. Management believes that they facilitate comparisons with prior periods and reflect the principal basis on which management monitors financial performance. Management also believes this presentation allows investors to more appropriately evaluate the impact of revenues from both taxable and tax-exempt sources.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

Foreign exchange and other trading revenue totaled $180 million compared with $222 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $191 million in the first quarter of 2012. In the second quarter of 2012, foreign exchange revenue totaled $157 million, a decrease of 15% year-over-year and an increase of 15% (unannualized) sequentially. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower volatility and volumes, while the sequential increase primarily resulted from higher volumes. Other trading revenue was $23 million in the second quarter of 2012 compared with $38 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $55 million in the first quarter of 2012. Both decreases were primarily driven by lower fixed income trading.
 
 
Investment and other income totaled $48 million compared with $145 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $139 million in the first quarter of 2012. The year-over-year decrease primarily resulted from lower asset-related gains and equity investment revenue. Sequentially, the decline primarily resulted from lower leasing gains, seed capital gains and equity investment revenue.

The following table presents the calculation of our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio on a fully-phased-in basis.
 
 
We generated $527 million of gross Basel I Tier 1 common equity in the second quarter of 2012.
Our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio was 8.7% at June 30, 2012 based on the NPRs and final market risk rule. The increase in the ratio from 7.6% at March 31, 2012, which was calculated under prior Basel III guidance and the proposed market risk rule, was primarily due to the reduction in risk-weighted assets related to treatment of sub-investment grade securities. This benefit was partially offset by the treatment of investment grade securitizations and financial institution exposure, as well as balance sheet growth in the second quarter.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO
At June 30, 2012, the fair value of our investment securities portfolio totaled $93.0 billion. The unrealized pre-tax net gain on our total securities portfolio was $1.4 billion at June 30, 2012 compared with $1.2 billion at March 31, 2012. During the second quarter of 2012, we received $246 million of paydowns and sold approximately $24 million of sub-investment grade securities.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PROVISION AND NET CHARGE-OFFS
 
The provision for credit losses was a credit of $19 million in the second quarter of 2012 primarily resulting from a decline in the expected loss related to a broker-dealer customer that previously filed for bankruptcy, as well as improvements in the mortgage portfolio. There was no provision in the second quarter of 2011 and a charge of $5 million in the first quarter of 2012.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION  EXPLANATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
BNY Mellon has included in this Earnings Review certain Non-GAAP financial measures based upon tangible common shareholders' equity. BNY Mellon believes that the return on tangible common equity measure, which excludes goodwill and intangible assets net of deferred tax liabilities, is a useful additional measure for investors because it presents a measure of BNY Mellon's performance in reference to those assets which are productive in generating income. The tangible common shareholders' equity ratio is expressed as a percentage of the actual book value of assets, as opposed to a percentage of a risk-based reduced value established in accordance with regulatory requirements, although BNY Mellon in its calculation has excluded certain assets which are given a zero percent risk-weighting for regulatory purposes. BNY Mellon has provided a measure of tangible book value per share, which it believes provides additional useful information as to the level of such assets in relation to shares of common stock outstanding.
BNY Mellon has presented revenue measures which exclude the effect of noncontrolling interests related to consolidated investment management funds and other revenue related to the Shareowner Services business, which was sold on Dec. 31 201l; and expense measures which exclude M&I expenses, litigation charges, restructuring charges and amortization of intangible assets and direct expense related to the Shareowner Services business. Return on equity measures and operating margin measures, which exclude some or all of these items, are also presented. BNY Mellon believes that these measures are useful to investors because they permit a focus on period-to-period comparisons which relate to the ability of BNY Mellon to enhance revenues and limit expenses in circumstances where such matters are within BNY Mellon's control. The excluded items in general relate to certain ongoing charges as a result of prior transactions or where we have incurred charges. M&I expenses primarily relate to the acquisitions of Global Investment Servicing on July 1, 2010 and BHF Asset Servicing GmbH on Aug. 2, 2010. M&I expenses generally continue for approximately three years after the transaction and can vary on a year-to-year basis depending on the stage of the integration. BNY Mellon believes that the exclusion of M&I expenses provides investors with a focus on BNY Mellon's business as it would appear on a consolidated going-forward basis, after such M&I expenses have ceased. Future periods will not reflect such M&I expenses, and thus may be more easily compared to our current results if M&I expenses are excluded. Litigation charges represent accruals for loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable, but exclude standard business-related legal fees. Restructuring charges relate to our operational excellence initiatives and migrating positions to global delivery centers. Excluding these charges permits investors to view expenses on a basis consistent with how management views the business. BNY Mellon also presents revenue and noninterest expense results relating to the Shareowner Services business so that an investor may compare those results with other periods, which do not include the Shareowner Services business.
The presentation of income (loss) from consolidated investment management funds, net of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest related to the consolidation of certain investment management funds permits investors to view revenue on a basis consistent with prior periods. BNY Mellon believes that these presentations, as a supplement to GAAP information, give investors a clearer picture of the results of its primary businesses.
In this Earnings Review, the net interest margin is presented on an FTE basis. We believe that this presentation provides comparability of amounts arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources, and is consistent with industry practice.
Each of these measures as described above is used by management to monitor financial performance, both on a company-wide and on a business-level basis.

Financial Trends
Notes:
The following transactions/changes have impacted the reporting of our results:
On December 31, 2011, BNY Mellon sold its Shareowner Services business. In the first quarter of 2012, we reclassified the results of the Shareowner Services business from the Investment Services business to the Other segment. The reclassification did not impact the consolidated results. All prior periods have been restated.
On July 1, 2010 and August 2, 2010 we completed the acquisitions of Global Investment Servicing ("GIS") and BHF Asset Servicing GmbH ("BAS"). The financial results for GIS are included in the Investment Services and Other businesses. The financial results for BAS are included in the Investment Services business.
On January 1, 2010, we adopted SFAS No. 167, "Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46 (R)." Certain investment management funds are disclosed separately on our balance sheet and securitizations are included in available-for-sale securities. The income statement separately discloses the operations of consolidated asset management funds and the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated investment management funds; previously these were disclosed as investment management and performance fees revenue and investment and other income.
The following items have impacted the comparability of our results:
Results for the first quarter of 2010 include a charge related to special litigation reserves.
Expense efficiency restructuring charges - Recorded charges in 2010 and 2011
All of these items are detailed in the trends that follow.
Certain immaterial reclassifications have been made to prior periods to place them on a basis comparable with the current period's presentation.
Discontinued Operations Accounting:
The income/(loss) and average assets from discontinued operations accounting have not been allocated to any business.
Average Assets:
In businesses where average deposits are greater than average loans, average assets include an allocation of investment securities equal to the difference. Consolidated average assets include average assets of discontinued operations.
Return on Common and Tangible Common Equity/Pretax Operating Margin:
Ratios are presented for continuing operations basis only. Quarterly return on common and tangible common equity ratios are annualized.
Non-GAAP Measures:
Certain Non-GAAP measures are included in the following schedules. These measures are used by management to monitor financial performance, both on a company-wide and on a business basis. These Non-GAAP measures impact certain revenue/expense categories, percentages and ratios by the exclusion and/or adjustment of items listed above and described in footnotes. For further information, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures' and Supplemental Information - Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures' in The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Quarterly Earnings Review dated July 18, 2012, furnished as an exhibit to the Report on Form 8-K to which these Financial Trends are furnished as an exhibit.
Summations may not equal due to rounding. As a result of this rounding convention, immaterial differences may exist between the business trends data versus business data on the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.
