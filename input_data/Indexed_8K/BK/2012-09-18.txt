Indemnification and Contribution
provided

(b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which such Underwriter may otherwise have.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability except to the extent that it has been prejudiced in any material respect by such failure or from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then
 
each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other, from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above and such indemnifying party was prejudiced in a material respect by such failure, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Underwriters, in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total commissions or discounts received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company or the Underwriters shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as a single entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total public offering price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters, under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability that the Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
 
10. . (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder at a Time of Delivery, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for them or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 10 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
Underwriter Defaults
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate number of all the Securities to be purchased at the Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of shares which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder at the Time of Delivery and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the number of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate number of all the Securities to be purchased at the Time of Delivery, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for its default.
 
11. . The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
Survival
12. . If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, any Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with the Transaction Documents and the offering of Securities contemplated hereby, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
Liabilities Upon Termination
13. . In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representatives.
Notices, etc
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile transmission to the Representatives; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; , , that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request.

The Corporation acknowledges that the bank accounts maintained by the Depositary in connection with the services provided under this Deposit Agreement will be in the Depositary's name and that the Depositary may receive investment earnings in connection with the investment at the Depositary's risk and for its benefit of funds held in those accounts from time to time. Neither the Corporation nor the record holders will receive interest on any deposits or funds held by the Depositary hereunder.
Section 4.2. Distributions Other than Cash, Rights, Preferences or Privileges.
Whenever the Depositary shall receive any distribution other than cash, rights, preferences or privileges upon the Series C Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall, subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, distribute to Record Holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.4 such amounts of the securities or property received by it as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipts held by such Holders, in any manner that the Depositary may deem equitable and practicable for accomplishing such distribution. If in the opinion of the Depositary such distribution cannot be made proportionately among such Record Holders, or if for any other reason (including any requirement that the Corporation or the Depositary withhold an amount on account of taxes or charges) the Depositary deems, after consultation with the Corporation, such distribution not to be feasible, the Depositary may, with the approval of the Corporation, adopt such method as it deems equitable and practicable for the purpose of effecting such distribution, including the sale (at public or private sale) of the securities or property thus received, or any part thereof, in a commercially reasonable manner. The net proceeds of any such sale shall, subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, be distributed or made available for distribution, as the case may be, by the Depositary to Record Holders of Receipts as provided by Section 4.1 in the case of a distribution received in cash. The Corporation shall not make any distribution of such securities or property to the Depositary and the Depositary shall not make any distribution of such securities or property to the Holders of Receipts unless the Corporation shall have provided an opinion of counsel stating that such securities or property have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered in connection with such distributions.
Section 4.3. Subscription Rights, Preferences or Privileges.
If the Corporation shall at any time offer or cause to be offered to the Persons in whose names shares of the Series C Preferred Stock is recorded on the books of the Corporation any rights, preferences or privileges to subscribe for or to purchase any securities or any rights,
 
preferences or privileges of any other nature, such rights, preferences or privileges shall in each such instance be communicated to the Depositary and made available by the Depositary to the Record Holders of Receipts in such manner as the Corporation shall direct and the Depositary shall agree, either by the issue to such Record Holders of warrants representing such rights, preferences or privileges or by such other method as may be approved by the Corporation in its discretion with the acknowledgement of the Depositary; , , that (i) if at the time of issue or offer of any such rights, preferences or privileges the Corporation determines that it is not lawful or (after consultation with the Depositary) not feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges available to Holders of Receipts by the issue of warrants or otherwise, or (ii) if and to the extent so instructed by Holders of Receipts who do not desire to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges, then the Corporation, in its discretion (with acknowledgement of the Depositary, in any case where the Corporation has determined that it is not feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges available), may, if applicable laws or the terms of such rights, preferences or privileges permit such transfer, sell such rights, preferences or privileges at public or private sale, at such place or places and upon such terms as it may deem proper. The net proceeds of any such sale shall be delivered to the Depositary and, if received, in accordance with the written instructions of the Corporation and, subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, be distributed by the Depositary to the Record Holders of Receipts entitled thereto as provided by Section 4.1 in the case of a distribution received in cash.
provided
however
The Corporation shall notify the Depositary whether registration under the Securities Act of the securities to which any rights, preferences or privileges relate is required in order for Holders of Receipts to be offered or sold the securities to which such rights, preferences or privileges relate, and the Corporation agrees with the Depositary that it will file promptly a registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act with respect to such rights, preferences or privileges and securities and use its best efforts and take all steps available to it to cause such registration statement to become effective sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such Holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges. In no event shall the Depositary make available to the Holders of Receipts any right, preference or privilege to subscribe for or to purchase any securities unless and until such registration statement shall have become effective, or the Corporation shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel to the effect that the offering and sale of such securities to the Holders are exempt from registration under the provisions of the Securities Act.
The Corporation shall notify the Depositary whether any other action under the laws of any jurisdiction or any governmental or administrative authorization, consent or permit is required in order for such rights, preferences or privileges to be made available to Holders of Receipts, and the Corporation agrees with the Depositary that the Corporation will use its reasonable best efforts to take such action or obtain such authorization, consent or permit sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such Holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges.
 
Section 4.4. Notice of Dividends, etc.; Fixing Record Date for Holders of Receipts.
Whenever any cash dividend or other cash distribution shall become payable or any distribution other than cash shall be made, or if rights, preferences or privileges shall at any time be offered, with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock, or whenever the Depositary shall receive notice of any meeting at which holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to vote or of which holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to notice, or whenever the Depositary and the Corporation shall decide it is appropriate, the Depositary shall in each such instance fix a record date (which shall be the same date as the record date fixed by the Corporation with respect to or otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Series C Preferred Stock) for the determination of the Holders of Receipts who shall be entitled to receive such dividend, distribution, rights, preferences or privileges or the net proceeds of the sale thereof, or to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at any such meeting, or who shall be entitled to notice of such meeting or for any other appropriate reasons.
Section 4.5. Voting Rights.
Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Designations, upon receipt of notice from the Corporation of any meeting at which the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the Depositary shall, if requested in writing and provided with all necessary information and documents, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail or transmit by such other method approved by the Depositary, in its reasonable discretion, to the Record Holders of Receipts, as determined on the record date set forth in Section 4.4, a notice prepared by the Corporation which shall contain (i) such information as is contained in such notice of meeting, (ii) a statement that the Holders of Receipts at the close of business on a specified record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.4 may, subject to any applicable restrictions, instruct the Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock represented by their respective Depositary Shares (including an express indication that instructions may be given to the Depositary to give a discretionary proxy to a Person designated by the Corporation), and (iii) a brief statement as to the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of the Holders of Receipts on the relevant record date, the Depositary shall endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such requests, the maximum number of whole shares of the Series C Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by all Receipts as to which any particular voting instructions are received. The Corporation hereby agrees to take all reasonable action which may be deemed necessary by the Depositary in order to enable the Depositary to vote such shares of the Series C Preferred Stock or cause such shares to be voted. In the absence of specific instructions from Holders of Receipts, the Depositary will not vote (but, at its discretion, may appear at any meeting with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock unless directed to the contrary by the Holders of all the Receipts) to the extent of the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipts. The Depositary shall not be required to exercise discretion in voting any Series C Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt.
Section 4.6. Changes Affecting Deposited Securities and Reclassifications, Recapitalizations, etc.
Upon any change in par or stated value, split-up, combination or any other reclassification of the Series C Preferred Stock, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Designations, or upon any recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation affecting the Corporation or to which it is a party, the Depositary shall, upon the written instructions of the
 
Corporation setting forth any adjustment, (i) make such adjustments as are certified by the Corporation in (a) the fraction of an interest represented by one Depositary Share in one share of the Series C Preferred Stock and (b) the ratio of the redemption price per Depositary Share to the redemption price per share of the Series C Preferred Stock, in each case as stated in such instructions and (ii) treat any securities or property (including cash) which shall be received by the Depositary in exchange for or upon conversion of or in respect of the Series C Preferred Stock as new deposited property so received in exchange for or upon conversion or in respect of such Series C Preferred Stock. In any such case, the Depositary shall, upon receipt of written instructions of the Corporation, execute and deliver additional Receipts or may call for the surrender of all outstanding Receipts to be exchanged for new Receipts specifically describing such new deposited property. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, Holders of Receipts shall have the right from and after the effective date of any such change in par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of the Series C Preferred Stock or any such recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation to surrender such Receipts to the Depositary with instructions to convert, exchange or surrender the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock represented thereby only into or for, as the case may be, the kind and amount of shares and other securities and property and cash into which the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock represented by such Receipts might have been converted or for which such shares might have been exchanged or surrendered immediately prior to the effective date of such transaction.
Section 4.7. Delivery of Reports.
The Depositary shall make available for inspection by Holders of Receipts at the Depositary's Office and at such other places as it may from time to time deem advisable during normal business hours any reports and communications received from the Corporation that are both received by the Depositary as the holder of the Deposited Shares and which the Corporation is required to furnish to the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock. In addition, the Depositary shall transmit, upon written request by the Corporation, certain notices and reports to the Holders of Receipts as provided in Section 5.5.
Section 4.8. Lists of Receipt Holders.
Promptly upon request from time to time by the Corporation, the Registrar shall furnish to it a list, as of the most recent practicable date, of the names, addresses and holdings of Depositary Shares of all registered Holders of Receipts.
Section 4.9. Withholding.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Deposit Agreement, in the event that the Depositary determines that any distribution in property is subject to any tax or other charge that the Depositary is obligated by law to withhold, the Depositary may dispose of, by public or private sale, all or a portion of such property in such amounts and in such manner as the Depositary deems necessary and practicable to pay such taxes or charges, and the Depositary shall distribute the net proceeds of any such sale or the balance of any such property after deduction of such taxes or charges to the Holders of Receipts entitled thereto in proportion to the number of Depositary Shares held by them, respectively; provided, however, that in the event the Depositary determines that such distribution of property is subject to withholding tax only with
 
respect to some but not all Holders of Receipts, the Depositary will use its best efforts (i) to sell only that portion of such property distributable to such holders that is required to generate sufficient proceeds to pay such withholding tax and (ii) to effect any such sale in such a manner so as to avoid affecting the rights of any other Holders of Receipts to receive such distribution in property.
Section 5.1. Maintenance of Offices, Agencies and Transfer Books by the Depositary; Registrar.
Upon execution of this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary shall maintain at the Depositary's Office, facilities for the execution and delivery, registration and registration of transfer, surrender and exchange of Receipts, and at the offices of the Depositary's Agents, if any, facilities for the delivery, registration of transfer, surrender and exchange of Receipts, all in accordance with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement.
The Depositary shall keep books at the Depositary's Office for the registration and registration of transfer of Receipts. Upon direction by the Corporation and with reasonable notice to the Depositary, the Registrar shall open its books for inspection by the Record Holders of Receipts as directed by the Corporation; that any record Holder shall be granted such right by the Corporation only after certifying that such inspection shall be for a proper purpose reasonably related to such Person's interest as an owner of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts.
provided
The Depositary or Registrar may close such books, at any time or from time to time, when deemed necessary or advisable by the Depositary, the Registrar, any Depositary's Agent or the Corporation because of any requirement of law or of any government, governmental body or commission, stock exchange or any applicable self-regulatory body.
If the Receipts or the Depositary Shares evidenced thereby or the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Shares shall be listed on one or more national securities exchanges, the Depositary may, with the written approval of the Corporation, appoint a Registrar (acceptable to the Corporation) for registration of the Receipts or Depositary Shares in accordance with any requirements of such exchange. Such Registrar (which may be the Depositary if so permitted by the requirements of any such exchange) may be removed and a substitute Registrar appointed by the Depositary upon the written request or with the written approval of the Corporation. If the Receipts, such Depositary Shares or the Series C Preferred Stock are listed on one or more other securities exchanges, the Depositary will, at the written request and expense of the Corporation, arrange such facilities for the delivery, registration, registration of transfer, surrender and exchange of such Receipts, such Depositary Shares or the Series C Preferred Stock as may be required by law or applicable securities exchange regulation.
 
Section 5.2. Prevention of or Delay in Performance by the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar or the Corporation.
Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Corporation, as the case may be, shall incur any liability to any Holder of Receipt if by reason of any provision of any present or future law, or regulation thereunder, of the United States of America or of any other governmental authority or, in the case of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent or the Registrar, as the case may be, by reason of any provision, present or future, of the Corporation's Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including the Certificate of Designations) or by reason of any act of God or war or other circumstance beyond the control of the relevant party, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, the Registrar or the Corporation, as the case may be, shall be prevented or forbidden from, or subjected to any penalty on account of, doing or performing any act or thing which the terms of this Deposit Agreement provide shall be done or performed; nor shall the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or the Corporation, as the case may be, incur liability to any Holder of a Receipt (i) by reason of any nonperformance or delay, caused as aforesaid, in the performance of any act or thing which the terms of this Deposit Agreement shall provide shall or may be done or performed, or (ii) by reason of any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any discretion provided for in this Deposit Agreement except as otherwise explicitly set forth in this Deposit Agreement.
Section 5.3. Obligations of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar, Transfer Agent and the Corporation.
Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar, any Transfer Agent nor the Corporation, as the case may be, assumes any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement to Holders of Receipts or to any other Person other than for its gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or fraud (each as finally determined by a non-appealable judgment, order, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction, an arbitral award or an agreement with the Corporation). Notwithstanding anything in this Deposit Agreement to the contrary, neither the Depositary, nor the Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor any Transfer Agent nor the Corporation, as the case may be, shall be liable in any event for special, punitive, incidental, indirect or consequential losses or damages of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if they have been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action. Any liability of Depositary, any Depositary's Agent or the Registrar or Transfer Agent, as the case may be, under this Deposit Agreement will be limited in the aggregate to an amount equal to the annual fees paid by the Corporation to such Person, but not including reimbursable expenses; provided, however, that in the event that such liability arises as a result of misappropriation of funds by the Depositary, any of the Depositary's Agents (except for such Depositary's Agents which are not employees of the Depositary), any Registrar or any Transfer Agent, as the case may be, through fraud or willful misconduct on the part of such Person (as determined by a non-appealable judgment, order, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction, an arbitral award or an agreement with the Corporation), such limit shall not apply and such liability hereunder shall be instead limited to the amount of such misappropriated funds or the liability resulting from such fraud or willful misconduct. Solely with respect to those matters covered by Section 7.12(l), Section 7.12(l) shall prevail over anything to the contrary stated in this paragraph.
Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor any Transfer Agent nor the Corporation, as the case may be, shall be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any action, suit or other proceeding in respect of the Series C Preferred Stock, the Depositary Shares or the Receipts which in its opinion may involve it in expense or liability unless indemnity satisfactory to it against all expense and liability be furnished as often as may be required.
 
Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor any Transfer Agent nor the Corporation, as the case may be, shall be liable for any action or any failure to act by it in reliance upon the written advice of legal counsel or accountants, or information from any Person presenting the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock for deposit, any Holder of a Receipt or any other Person believed by it to be competent to give such information. The Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar, any Transfer Agent and the Corporation, as the case may be, may each rely and shall each be protected in acting upon or omitting to act upon any written notice, request, direction or other document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
The Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, any Transfer Agent or Registrar, as the case may be, shall not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instruction to vote any of the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock or for the manner or effect of any such vote made, as long as any such action or non-action is not taken in bad faith, fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence (each as finally determined by a non-appealable judgment, order, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction, an arbitral award or an agreement with the Corporation). The Depositary undertakes, and any Depositary's Agent, Registrar and any Transfer Agent, as the case may be, shall be required to undertake, to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Deposit Agreement, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Deposit Agreement against the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, Registrar or any Transfer Agent.
The Depositary, its parent, Affiliate, or subsidiaries, any Depositary's Agents, and any Transfer Agent and any Registrar, as the case may be, may own and deal in any class of securities of the Corporation and its Affiliates and in Receipts or Depositary Shares or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Corporation or its Affiliates may be interested or contract with or lend money to or otherwise act as fully or as freely as if it were not the Depositary, the parent, Affiliate or subsidiary of the Depositary or the Depositary's Agent or Transfer Agent or Registrar hereunder. The Depositary may also act as transfer agent, trustee or registrar of any of the securities of the Corporation and its Affiliates or act in any other capacity for the Corporation or its Affiliates.
The Depositary shall not be under any liability for interest on any monies at any time received by it pursuant to any of the provisions of this Deposit Agreement or of the Receipts, the Depositary Shares or the Series C Preferred Stock nor shall it be obligated to segregate such monies from other monies held by it, except as required by law. The Depositary shall not be responsible for advancing funds on behalf of the Corporation and shall have no duty or obligation to make any payments if it has not timely received sufficient funds to make timely payments.
In the event the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, any Transfer Agent or Registrar, as the case may be, believes any ambiguity or uncertainty exists hereunder or in any notice, instruction, direction, request or other communication, paper or document received by the
 
Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, any Transfer Agent or Registrar hereunder, or in the administration of any of the provisions of this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, any Transfer Agent or Registrar shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, omitting or suffering to take any action hereunder, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, any Transfer Agent or Registrar may, in its sole discretion upon providing written notice to the Corporation, refrain from taking any action and the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, any Transfer Agent or Registrar shall be fully protected and shall not be liable in any way to the Corporation, any Holders of Receipts or any other Person or entity for refraining from taking such action, unless the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, any Transfer Agent or Registrar receives written instructions or a certificate of the Corporation which eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, any Transfer Agent or Registrar or which proves or establishes the applicable matter to the satisfaction of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, any Transfer Agent or Registrar. Such written instructions shall be full and complete authorization to the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, any Transfer Agent or Registrar, as the case may be, and the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, any Transfer Agent or Registrar shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this Deposit Agreement in reliance upon such written instructions.
In the event the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, the Registrar or the Transfer Agent, as the case may be, shall receive conflicting claims, requests or instructions from any Holders of Receipts, on the one hand, and the Corporation, on the other hand, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, the Registrar or the Transfer Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to act on such claims, requests or instructions received from the Corporation, and shall incur no liability and shall be entitled to the full indemnification set forth in Section 5.6 hereof in connection with any action so taken.
It is intended that the Depositary shall not be deemed to be an "issuer" of the securities under the federal securities laws or applicable state securities laws, it being expressly understood and agreed that the Depositary is acting only in a ministerial capacity as Depositary for the deposited Series C Preferred Stock. The Depositary will not be under any duty or responsibility to ensure compliance with any applicable federal or state securities laws in connection with the issuance, transfer or exchange of the Receipts, the shares of Series C Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares.
Neither the Depositary (or its officers, directors, employees or agents), any Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar or any Transfer Agent makes any representation or has any responsibility as to the validity of any registration statement pursuant to which the Depositary Shares may be registered under the Securities Act, the deposited Preferred Shares, the Depositary Shares, the Receipts (except its countersignature thereon) or any instruments referred to therein or herein, or as to the correctness of any statement made in any such registration statement or herein.
The Depositary assumes no responsibility for the correctness of the description that appears in the Receipts. Notwithstanding any other provision herein or in the Receipts, the Depositary makes no warranties or representations as to the validity or genuineness of any shares of Series C Preferred Stock at any time deposited with the Depositary hereunder or of the
 
Depositary Shares, as to the validity or sufficiency of this Deposit Agreement, as to the value of the Depositary Shares or as to any right, title or interest of the record holders of Receipts in and to the Depositary Shares. The Depositary shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Corporation of the Depositary Shares or the Receipts or the proceeds thereof.
The Depositary, Depositary's Agent, any Registrar, and any Transfer Agent hereunder:
(i) shall have no duties or obligations other than those specifically set forth herein (and no implied duties or obligations), or as may subsequently be agreed to in writing by the parties;
(ii) shall have no obligation to make payment hereunder unless the Corporation shall have provided the necessary federal or other immediately available funds or securities or property, as the case may be, to pay in full amounts due and payable with respect thereto;
(iii) shall not be obligated to prosecute or defend any litigation or other proceeding hereunder; if, however, the Depositary determines to prosecute or defend any litigation or other proceeding hereunder, and, where the taking of such action might in the Depositary's judgment subject or expose it to any expense or liability, the Depositary shall not be required to act unless it shall have been furnished with an indemnity satisfactory to it;
(iv) may rely on and shall be authorized and protected in acting or failing to act upon any certificate, instrument, opinion, notice, letter, telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or other document or security delivered to the Depositary and believed by the Depositary to be genuine and to have been signed by the proper party or parties, and shall have no responsibility for determining the accuracy thereof;
(v) may rely on and shall be authorized and protected in acting or failing to act upon the written, telephonic, electronic and oral instructions, with respect to any matter relating to the Depositary's actions as Depositary covered by this Deposit Agreement (or supplementing or qualifying any such actions) of officers of the Corporation;
(vi) may consult counsel satisfactory to it, and the written advice of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by the Depositary hereunder in accordance with the advice of such counsel;
(vii) except as specifically set forth herein, shall not be called upon at any time to advise any Person with respect to the shares of Series C Preferred Stock or Receipts;
(viii) shall not be liable in any respect on account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties (other than with respect to the Depositary) executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Deposit Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for under this Deposit Agreement; and
 
(ix) shall not be liable for any failures, delays or losses, arising directly or indirectly out of conditions beyond their reasonable control, including, but not limited to, (i) work stoppages or labor disputes, electrical or mechanical failure or computer hardware or software failure, in each case other than of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, the Registrar or the Transfer Agent, as the case may be, or (ii) acts of government, exchange or market ruling, suspension of trading, civil disobedience, riots, rebellions, communications facilities failures including telephone failure, war, terrorism, insurrection, fires, earthquakes, storms, floods, acts of God or similar occurrences.
The obligations of the Corporation set forth in this Section 5.3 shall survive the replacement, removal or resignation of the Depositary, Registrar, Transfer Agent or Depositary's Agent or termination of this Deposit Agreement.
Section 5.4. Resignation and Removal of the Depositary; Appointment of Successor Depositary.
The Depositary may at any time resign as Depositary hereunder by delivering notice of its election to do so to the Corporation, such resignation to take effect upon the appointment of a successor Depositary and its acceptance of such appointment as hereinafter provided.
The Depositary may at any time be removed by the Corporation by notice of such removal delivered to the Depositary, such removal to take effect upon the appointment of a successor Depositary hereunder and its acceptance of such appointment as hereinafter provided.
In case at any time the Depositary acting hereunder shall resign or be removed, the Corporation shall, within sixty (60) days after the delivery of the notice of resignation or removal, as the case may be, appoint a successor Depositary, which shall be (i) a Person having its principal office in the United States of America and having a combined capital and surplus, along with its Affiliates, of at least $50,000,000 or (ii) an Affiliate of any such Person. In the event of such removal or resignation, the Corporation will appoint a successor depositary and inform the Depositary of the name and address of any successor depositary so appointed, provided that no failure by the Corporation to appoint such a successor depositary shall affect the termination of this Deposit Agreement or the discharge of the Corporation and the Depositary as depositary hereunder. Upon payment of all outstanding fees and expenses hereunder, the Depositary shall promptly forward to the successor depositary or its designee any shares of stock held by it and any certificates, letters, notices and other document that the Depositary may receive after its appointment has so terminated.
If no successor Depositary shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment within sixty (60) days after delivery of such notice, the resigning or removed Depositary may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Depositary. Every successor Depositary shall execute and deliver to its predecessor and to the Corporation an instrument in writing accepting its appointment hereunder, and thereupon such successor Depositary, without any further act or deed, shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor and for all purposes shall be the Depositary under this Deposit Agreement, and such predecessor, upon payment of all sums due it
 
and on the written request of the Corporation, shall promptly execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor all rights and powers of such predecessor hereunder, shall duly assign, transfer and deliver all right, title and interest in the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock and any moneys or property held hereunder to such successor, and shall deliver to such successor a list of the Record Holders of all outstanding Receipts and such records, books and other information in its possession relating thereto. Any successor Depositary shall promptly mail or transmit by such other method approved by such successor Depositary, in its reasonable discretion, notice of its appointment to the Record Holders of Receipts.
Any Person into or with which the Depositary may be merged, consolidated or converted, or any Person to which all or a substantial part of the assets of the Depositary may be transferred or which succeeds to the shareholder services business of the Depositary shall be the successor of the Depositary without the execution or filing of any document or any further act, and notice thereof shall not be required hereunder. Such successor Depositary may authenticate the Receipts in the name of the predecessor Depositary or its own name as successor Depositary.
The removal or resignation of the Depositary shall automatically be deemed to be a removal of the Depositary as Registrar and Transfer Agent herein without any further act or deed.
Section 5.5. Corporate Notices and Reports.
The Corporation agrees that it will deliver to the Depositary, and the Depositary will, promptly after receipt of all necessary information and documents, transmit to the Record Holders of Receipts, in each case at the addresses recorded in the Depositary's or Registrar's books, copies of all notices and reports (including without limitation financial statements) required by law, by the rules of any national securities exchange upon which the Series C Preferred Stock, the Depositary Shares or the Receipts are listed or by the Corporation's Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including the Certificate of Designations), to be furnished to the Record Holders of Receipts. Such transmission will be at the Corporation's expense and the Corporation will provide the Depositary with such number of copies of such documents as the Depositary may reasonably request. In addition, the Depositary will transmit to the Record Holders of Receipts at the Corporation's expense such other documents as may be requested in writing by the Corporation.
Section 5.6. Indemnification by the Corporation.
Notwithstanding Section 5.3 to the contrary, the Corporation shall indemnify the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar and any Transfer Agent (including each of their officers, directors, agents and employees) against, and hold each of them harmless from and against, any fee, loss, damage, cost, penalty, fine, judgment, liability or expense (including the reasonable costs and expenses of its legal counsel) which may arise out of acts performed, taken or omitted to be taken in connection with its acting as Depositary, Depositary's Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent, respectively, under this Deposit Agreement (including, without limitation, the enforcement by the Depositary, Depositary's Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent, as the case may be, of this Deposit Agreement) and the Receipts by the Depositary, any Registrar or any of their respective agents (including any Depositary's Agent) and any transactions or documents
 
contemplated hereby, except for any liability arising out of negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or fraud (each as finally determined by a non-appealable judgment, order, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction, an arbitral award or an agreement with the Corporation) on the respective parts of any such Person or Persons. The obligations of the Corporation set forth in this Section 5.6 shall survive any succession of any Depositary, Registrar, Transfer Agent or Depositary's Agent or termination of this Deposit Agreement.
Section 5.7. Fees, Charges and Expenses.
The Corporation agrees promptly to pay the Depositary the compensation, as set forth in Exhibit D hereto or, if thereafter separately agreed upon with the Corporation, in accordance with such subsequent agreed upon terms, for all services rendered by the Depositary, Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent and Registrar hereunder and to reimburse the Depositary for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Depositary, Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent and Registrar without gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or fraud on its part (each as finally determined by a non-appealable judgment, order, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction, an arbitral award or an agreement with the Corporation) in connection with the services rendered by it (or any agent of the Depositary) hereunder. The Corporation shall pay all charges of the Depositary in connection with the initial deposit of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock and the initial issuance of the Depositary Shares, all withdrawals of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock by owners of Depositary Shares, and any redemption or exchange of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock at the option of the Corporation.

confidentiality of the Personal Information, (ii) protect against any foreseeable threats or hazards to the security or integrity of Personal Information, (iii) protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information, and (iv) ensure secure and appropriate disposal of the Personal Information.

(j) Computershare shall return to the Corporation or, with the Corporation's permission, destroy all Personal Information and other confidential information of the Corporation in any form in Computershare's possession or in the possession of Computershare's agents or subcontractors in accordance with Computershare's records retention and destruction policies, and retain no copies thereof.

Computershare will upon request review its records retention and destruction policies with the Corporation.
(k) Computershare shall upon request from time to time provide the Corporation with a list of all subcontractors (including affiliates of Computershare) who have access to Personal Information. In addition, Computershare shall notify the Corporation in writing in advance of entering into a new agreement with any subcontractor that will have access to Personal Information. In the event that the Corporation objects to any new or existing subcontractor having access to Personal Information, Computershare shall work with the Corporation to resolve the Corporation's concerns. Computershare shall use appropriate diligence and care in selecting its subcontractors. Computershare agrees to include in written agreements with any agent or subcontractor to whom it provides access to Personal Information, confidentiality and security obligations with respect to such Information that are at least as restrictive as those that apply to Computershare hereunder, and to require the subcontractor to comply with such provisions and with Computershare's obligations under Section 7.12(e) above with respect to subcontractors; provided, however, that to the extent that Computershare's existing agreements with its agents and subcontractors do not require its agents and subcontractors to comply with Computershare's obligations under Section 7.12(e) above, Computershare shall by June 30, 2013 amend such agreements to require such compliance. Prior to June 30, 2013, Computershare shall not be deemed in breach of its obligations under Section 7.12 (e) above to arrange for the Corporation to conduct site visits of a subcontractor or requiring a subcontractor to complete the Corporation's questionnaires, if Computershare's agreement with such subcontractor does not enable Computershare to require such subcontractor to comply. Computershare shall enforce its agreements with its agents and subcontractors. Computershare shall be responsible for the acts and omissions of its agents and subcontractors to the same extent as if such acts and omissions were those of Computershare.
(l) Without regard to any limitation of liability in this or any other agreement, Computershare shall indemnify and hold the Corporation harmless for all costs, losses, fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees), claims, investigations, damages and expenses, including but not limited to monetary penalties, incurred by the Corporation or any of its affiliates as a result of a breach of Computershare's obligations under this Section 7.12; provided, however, that such obligation to indemnify and hold the Corporation harmless is subject to a monetary limit of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) per calendar year, except that there shall be no
 
monetary limit in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct. In addition to any other rights the Corporation may have under this Deposit Agreement or at law, since unauthorized use or disclosure of Personal Information or other confidential information may result in immediate and irreparable injury to the Corporation for which monetary damages may not be adequate, in the event that Computershare or any officer, director, employee, agent, or subcontractor of Computershare uses or discloses, or in the Corporation's sole opinion is likely to use or disclose, Personal Information or other confidential information in breach of Computershare's obligations hereunder, the Corporation shall be entitled to equitable relief, including temporary and permanent injunctive relief and specific performance. The Corporation shall also be entitled to the recovery of any pecuniary gain realized by Computershare from the unauthorized use or disclosure of Personal Information or confidential information. In no event will any payments paid or payable under this Section 7.12(l) be included in the amount of damages or losses that are subject to any limitation of liability in any other provision of this Deposit Agreement or in any other agreement.
(m) The provisions of this Section 7.12 shall survive expiration or termination of this Deposit Agreement for any reason.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation and the Depositary have duly executed this Deposit Agreement as of the day and year first above set forth, and all Holders of Receipts shall become parties hereto by and upon acceptance by them of delivery of Receipts issued in accordance with the terms hereof.

In connection with the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), of up to 25,300,000 depositary shares (the "Depositary Shares"), each representing a 1/4,000th interest in a share of Series C Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, liquidation preference of $100,000 per share, $0.01 par value per share (the "Series C Preferred Stock"), of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and evidenced by a depositary receipt (the "Depositary Receipt") to be issued pursuant to a Deposit Agreement, dated as of September 17, 2012 (the "Deposit Agreement"), among the Company, Computershare Shareowner Services LLC, as depositary (the "Depositary"), and the holders from time to time of the Depositary Receipt described therein, I, as counsel for the Company, have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
Upon the basis of such examination, it is my opinion that, (1) when (i) issued as contemplated by the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-167832) (the "Registration Statement") and deposited by the Company with the Depositary in accordance with the terms of the Deposit Agreement, and (ii) paid for in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, dated September 12, 2012 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC, as Representatives of the several Underwriters named therein, the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock to be deposited with the Depositary pursuant to the Deposit Agreement relating to the Depositary Shares (the "Series C Preferred Shares") will have been validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, (2) upon due issuance by the Depositary of the Depositary Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares against the deposit of the Series C Preferred Shares in accordance with the terms of the Deposit Agreement and payment therefor in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement, the Depositary Shares will have been validly issued, and (3) when (x) the Series C Preferred Shares have been issued as contemplated by the Registration Statement and deposited by the Company with the Depositary in accordance with the terms of the Deposit Agreement and (y) the Depositary
 
 
Receipt have been issued in accordance with the terms of the Deposit Agreement, the Depositary Receipt will constitute a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company and entitle the holder thereof to the rights specified in the Depositary Receipt and the Deposit Agreement, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
The foregoing opinion is limited to the Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and I am expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
I have relied as to certain matters on factual information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and other sources believed by me to be responsible, and I have assumed that the Series C Preferred Shares will have been deposited with the Depositary in accordance with the Deposit Agreement, that the Deposit Agreement will have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Depositary, that the certificates evidencing the Series C Preferred Shares and the Depositary Receipt will conform to the respective specimens thereof examined by me, that the certificate evidencing the Depositary Receipt will have been duly executed and delivered by one of the Depositary's authorized officers and, if executed in facsimile by the Depositary, will have been duly signed by a registrar of the Depositary Receipt, that the certificate for the Series C Preferred Shares will have been duly countersigned and registered by the registrar and transfer agent of the Series C Preferred Shares, and that the signatures on all documents examined by me are genuine, assumptions which I have not independently verified.
I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion letter as Exhibit 5.1 to the Form 8-K and to the use of my name therein and in the Prospectus Supplement, dated September 12, 2012, under the caption "Validity of Securities", which supplements the Prospectus, dated June 28, 2010. By giving such consent, I do not hereby admit that I am within the category of persons whose consents are required under Section 7 of the Act.
