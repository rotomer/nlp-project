On October 17, 2012, the Registrant conducted a conference call and webcast with respect to results of operations for third quarter 2012 for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation. In conjunction with the conference call and webcast, the Registrant made available on its website, beginning on October 17, 2012, a Quarterly Earnings Review and Financial Trends information. The Quarterly Earnings Review is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and the Financial Trends information is included as Exhibit 99.2 to this report. Both exhibits are "furnished" pursuant to General Instruction B.2. of Form 8-K and are not "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not incorporated by reference into any filings the Registrant has made or may make under the Securities Act of 1933.
 
Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 to this report contain information which may be considered to constitute "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K.

Management believes that they facilitate comparisons with prior periods and reflect the principal basis on which management monitors financial performance. Management also believes this presentation allows investors to more appropriately evaluate the impact of revenues from both taxable and tax-exempt sources.

Foreign exchange and other trading revenue totaled $182 million compared with $200 million in the third quarter of 2011 and $180 million in the second quarter of 2012. In the third quarter of 2012, foreign exchange revenue totaled $121 million, a decrease of 45% year-over-year and 23% sequentially. Both decreases reflect lower volatility and volumes. Other trading revenue was $61 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared with a loss of $21 million in the third quarter of 2011 and revenue of $23 million in the second quarter of 2012. The increases compared with both prior periods reflect improved fixed income trading.
 
 
Investment and other income totaled $124 million compared with $83 million in the third quarter of 2011 and $48 million in the second quarter of 2012. The year-over-year increase primarily resulted from higher seed capital gains. Sequentially, the increase primarily resulted from seed capital gains, higher equity investment revenue and higher asset-related gains.

CAPITAL
The following table presents our Basel I Tier 1 common equity generated.
 
We generated $780 million of gross Basel I Tier 1 common equity in the third quarter of 2012.
The following table presents our capital ratios.
 
 
Our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio  Non-GAAP was 9.3% at Sept. 30, 2012 compared with 8.7% at June 30, 2012. The increase was primarily due to earnings retention and an increase in the value of the investment portfolio, partially offset by higher risk-weighted assets.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO
At Sept. 30, 2012, the fair value of our investment securities portfolio totaled $103.6 billion. The unrealized pre-tax net gain on our total securities portfolio was $2.5 billion at Sept. 30, 2012 compared with $1.4 billion at June 30, 2012.

NONPERFORMING ASSETS
 
 
Nonperforming other residential mortgage loans decreased $62 million from Sept. 30, 2011 to $166 million at Sept. 30, 2012. The decrease primarily resulted from paydowns, sales, returns to accrual status and charge-offs.
ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PROVISION AND NET CHARGE-OFFS
 
The provision for credit losses was a credit of $5 million in 3Q12 primarily resulting from loan sales and repayments. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $22 million in 3Q11 and a credit of $19 million in 2Q12.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION  EXPLANATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
BNY Mellon has included in this Earnings Review certain Non-GAAP financial measures based upon tangible common shareholders' equity. BNY Mellon believes that the ratio of Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets and the ratio of tangible common shareholders' equity to tangible assets of operations are measures of capital strength that provide additional useful information to investors, supplementing the Tier 1 and Total capital ratios which are utilized by regulatory authorities. The ratio of Basel I Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets excludes preferred stock, as well as the trust preferred securities which will be phased out of Basel I Tier 1 regulatory capital beginning in 2013. Unlike the Basel I Tier 1 and Total capital ratios, the tangible common shareholders' equity ratio fully incorporates those changes in investment securities valuations which are reflected in total shareholders' equity. In addition, this ratio is expressed as a percentage of the actual book value of assets, as opposed to a percentage of a risk-based reduced value established in accordance with regulatory requirements, although BNY Mellon in its calculation has excluded certain assets which are given a zero percent risk-weighting for regulatory purposes. Further, BNY Mellon believes that the return on tangible common equity measure, which excludes goodwill and intangible assets net of deferred tax liabilities, is a useful additional measure for investors because it presents a measure of BNY Mellon's performance in reference to those assets which are productive in generating income. BNY Mellon has presented its estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio on a basis that is representative of how it currently understands the Basel III rules. Management views the Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio as a key measure in monitoring BNY Mellon's capital position. The presentation of the Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio allows investors to compare BNY Mellon's Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio with estimates presented by other companies. Additionally, BNY Mellon has provided a measure of tangible book value per share, which it believes provides additional useful information as to the level of such assets in relation to shares of common stock outstanding.
BNY Mellon has presented revenue measures which exclude the effect of noncontrolling interests related to consolidated investment management funds and other revenue related to the Shareowner Services business, which was sold on Dec. 31, 2011; and expense measures which exclude M&I expenses, litigation charges, restructuring charges, amortization of intangible assets and direct expenses related to the Shareowner Services business. Return on equity measures and operating margin measures, which exclude some or all of these items, are also presented. BNY Mellon believes that these measures are useful to investors because they permit a focus on period-to-period comparisons which relate to the ability of BNY Mellon to enhance revenues and limit expenses in circumstances where such matters are within BNY Mellon's control. The excluded items in general relate to certain ongoing charges as a result of prior transactions or where we have incurred charges. M&I expenses primarily relate to the acquisitions of Global Investment Servicing on July 1, 2010 and BHF Asset Servicing GmbH on Aug. 2, 2010. M&I expenses generally continue for approximately three years after the transaction and can vary on a year-to-year basis depending on the stage of the integration. BNY Mellon believes that the exclusion of M&I expenses provides investors with a focus on BNY Mellon's business as it would appear on a consolidated going-forward basis, after such M&I expenses have ceased. Future periods will not reflect such M&I expenses, and thus may be more easily compared to our current results if M&I expenses are excluded. Litigation charges represent accruals for loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable, but exclude standard business-related legal fees. Restructuring charges relate to our operational excellence initiatives and migrating positions to global delivery centers. Excluding these charges permits investors to view expenses on a basis consistent with how management views the business. BNY Mellon also presents revenue and noninterest expense results relating to the Shareowner Services business so that an investor may compare those results with other periods, which do not include the Shareowner Services business.
The presentation of income (loss) from consolidated investment management funds, net of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest related to the consolidation of certain investment management funds permits investors to view revenue on a basis consistent with prior periods. BNY Mellon believes that these presentations, as a supplement to GAAP information, give investors a clearer picture of the results of its primary businesses.
In this Earnings Review, the net interest margin is presented on an FTE basis. We believe that this presentation provides comparability of amounts arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources, and is consistent with industry practice.

On December 31, 2011, BNY Mellon sold its Shareowner Services business. In the first quarter of 2012, we reclassified the results of the Shareowner Services business from the Investment Services business to the Other segment. The reclassification did not impact the consolidated results. All prior periods have been restated.

The financial results for GIS are included in the Investment Services and Other businesses. The financial results for BAS are included in the Investment Services business.
On January 1, 2010, we adopted SFAS No. 167, "Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46 (R)." Certain investment management funds are disclosed separately on our balance sheet and securitizations are included in available-for-sale securities. The income statement separately discloses the operations of consolidated asset management funds and the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated investment management funds; previously these were disclosed as investment management and performance fees revenue and investment and other income.
The following items have impacted the comparability of our results:
Results for the first quarter of 2010 include a charge related to special litigation reserves.
