Item 4.02(a) Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review
On August 9, 2007, the management of BlackRock, Inc. ("BlackRock") determined that the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows included in the financial statements of BlackRock as of and for the three-months ended March 31, 2007 included in BlackRock's Form 10-Q for that period should no longer be relied upon with respect to the matters discussed below. BlackRock determined that approximately $190 million of cash flows related to non-controlling interests of consolidated investment funds (which primarily reflect funds acquired in the MLIM Transaction) had been erroneously classified as cash flows from operating activities instead of cash flows from financing activities on its Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the interim period ended March 31, 2007. This error had no effect on BlackRock's financial condition, results of operations or margins.
Management has discussed this matter with Deloitte & Touche LLP, its independent registered public accounting firm.
BlackRock intends to file an amended Form 10-Q for the interim period ended March 31, 2007 as soon as practicable.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
