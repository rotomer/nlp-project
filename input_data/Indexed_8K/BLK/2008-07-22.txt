Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the parties agree to establish a committee composed of two BlackRock managers and one Merrill Lynch manager to consider cases in which it would be acceptable and appropriate to allow Merrill Lynch and its Affiliates to engage on a limited, case-by-case basis, in Merrill Lynch Restricted Activities.  In particular, if Merrill Lynch or its Affiliates determine that (1) there is customer demand for a product that BlackRock does not provide, or desire to provide on commercially reasonable terms, and (2) Merrill Lynch and/or its Affiliates has made a reasonable exploration for alternative providers, then the committee will consider and decide in good faith, in the discretion of a majority of the committee members, whether to permit Merrill Lynch or an Affiliate to provide such product notwithstanding that to do so Merrill Lynch or such Affiliate would be engaged in Merrill Lynch Restricted Activities.
 
Furthermore, Merrill Lynch hereby agrees, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary other than as an incidental effect of the exceptions to the definitions of Fund and Separately Managed Account set forth below, that neither IQ Investment Advisors nor any other investment advisor controlled by Merrill Lynch during the term of this Agreement will (i) directly or through one or more sub-advisers create a family of open-end funds for the purpose of replicating that portion of the asset management business of BlackRock or establishing a direct competitive threat to BlackRock, or (ii) create an open-end fund or family of open-end funds for the purpose of replicating the MLIM FDP platform or establishing a direct competitive threat to MLIM FDP.

Merrill Lynch nor any Affiliate will be deemed to be acting as an Asset Manager in instances where it serves as an investment adviser with responsibilities for manager selection and asset allocation (or other overlay functions) that delegates primary day-to-day selection of underlying securities or other assets to a sub-adviser that is not under the control of Merrill Lynch (it being agreed that BlackRock is not under the control of Merrill Lynch for this purpose) and provided further, that Merrill Lynch will not be deemed to be acting as an Asset Manager to new financial technology, the primary purpose of which is not to provide active asset management services to third party investors.
 
For purposes of this section, "Fund" shall mean any collective investment fund, wherever domiciled.
 
For purposes of this provision, "Separately Managed Account" shall mean an account established in the name of and for the exclusive benefit of any person that is not a Fund pursuant to which such person receives investment advisory services; provided, however, Separately Managed Account shall not include an account of a customer or client of a retail broker, retail financial advisor, private wealth advisor or other retail sales person ("Retail Sales Person") for which (1) a Retail Salesperson acts as portfolio manager, or (2) a Merrill Lynch affiliated bank or trust company acts as trustee or investment advisor but qualifies for exclusion from acting as an Asset Manager pursuant to the first proviso to the definition thereof or supervises asset management services by the Retail Sales Person or an unaffiliated third party manager.

For purposes of this section, a "Structured Finance Vehicle" is any collective investment vehicle that relies on a trust, commodity pool, depositary facility or other collective investment entity that has the primary purpose of aggregating securities, commodities or other financial instruments for the purpose of (i) repackaging illiquid instruments or derivatives, or (ii) tranching or aggregating financial instruments to change their tax, cost, accounting, yield, credit, leverage, ERISA or risk characteristics,
 
 
 
Nothing herein shall prohibit Merrill Lynch or any of its Affiliates from engaging in any business activities of any kind or nature currently engaged in by Merrill Lynch or any of its Affiliates as of the date of the Transaction Agreement or this Agreement; provided, however, that the acquisition and holding of an Affiliate pursuant to Section 5.1(b)(i)(C) or (D) after the date of the Transaction Agreement shall not give rise to any rights on the part of Merrill Lynch or any other Affiliate of Merrill Lynch to engage in any business activities under this sentence.
 
(ii)
  
As used in this Section 5.1, the term "BlackRock Restricted Activities" means engaging, whether directly or indirectly through ownership of any interest in or consensual arrangements relating to another Person that is directly or indirectly engaged, in the retail securities brokerage business; , , that the term "BlackRock Restricted Activities" shall in no event include acting as the distributor of publicly offered Funds primarily through third party sales forces or acting as a placement agent for privately offered Funds.
