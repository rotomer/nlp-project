Item 1.01          Entry into Material Definitive Agreement
 
On September 25, 2008, BlackRock, Inc. ("BlackRock") entered into a consent and waiver (the "Consent") with Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. ("Merrill Lynch") under the Amended and Restated Stockholder Agreement (the "Stockholder Agreement"), dated as of July 16, 2008, between Merrill Lynch and BlackRock. The Consent was granted in connection with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's (the "Federal Reserve") recent expansion of eligible collateral under the Primary Dealer Credit Facility Program.
 
In the Consent, BlackRock consented to Merrill Lynch entering into one or more repurchase agreements (each, a "Repurchase Agreement") with the Federal Reserve for all or a part of the shares of BlackRock common stock (collectively, the "BlackRock Securities") owned by Merrill Lynch. The Consent does not modify any of Merrill Lynch's economic or voting interests in BlackRock or its other obligations under the Stockholder Agreement. Upon termination of a Repurchase Agreement, Merrill Lynch will continue to have all rights and obligations regarding the BlackRock Securities under the Stockholder Agreement. The Consent expires upon, and any Repurchase Agreements must be terminated no later than, consummation of Merrill Lynchs proposed merger with Bank of America.  If Merrill Lynch does not meet its obligations under a Repurchase Agreement, neither the Federal Reserve nor any subsequent owner of the BlackRock Securities will be subject to any of the terms or provisions of the Stockholder Agreement.  In that case, Merrill Lynch will remain subject to all applicable terms of the Stockholder Agreement.
