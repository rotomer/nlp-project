Barclays Purchase Agreement
 
On June 16, 2009, BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock) announced that Barclays PLC accepted its offer to acquire Barclays Global Investors (BGI).  On June 16, 2009, BlackRock entered into a definitive purchase agreement (the Barclays Purchase Agreement) to acquire BGI from Barclays Bank PLC (Barclays).
 
Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Barclays Purchase Agreement, BlackRock will acquire (the Acquisition) from Barclays all of the outstanding equity interests of subsidiaries of Barclays conducting the business of BGI in exchange for an aggregate of approximately 37.8 million shares of BlackRock common stock and participating preferred stock, subject to certain adjustments, and $6.6 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments. The shares of common stock issued pursuant to the Acquisition will represent approximately 4.9% of the outstanding shares of common stock of BlackRock immediately following the closing of the Acquisition, and the total equity consideration will represent approximately an aggregate 19.9% economic interest in BlackRock immediately following the closing of the Acquisition.
 
The Acquisition consideration will be subject to adjustment (i) to reflect the closing working capital of BGI and (ii) if and to the extent the adjusted asset-based fees generated by BGI as of a date close to the closing of the Acquisition, excluding the impact of market movements, are less than 90% of their level at April 30, 2009.
 
BlackRock and Barclays have each made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Barclays Purchase Agreement for transactions of this type, including, among others, covenants (i) to conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary course between the execution of the Barclays Purchase Agreement and the closing of the Acquisition and (ii) not to engage in certain kinds of transactions during such period. Barclays and Barclays PLC have made additional covenants (a) not to solicit alternative acquisition proposals relating to the BGI business, (b) subject to certain exceptions contained in the Barclays Purchase Agreement, not to engage in certain competitive activities for a period of three years following the closing of the Acquisition and (c) that Barclays PLCs board of directors will recommend the approval of the Acquisition to its shareholders.
 
Consummation of the Acquisition is subject to customary conditions for transactions of this type, including, among others, (i) the approval of the Acquisition by the shareholders of Barclays PLC, (ii) the expiration or termination of the applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino Act waiting period and the receipt of other applicable antitrust approvals, (iii) the absence of any order or injunction prohibiting the consummation of the Acquisition or restricting the ownership or operation of the BGI business or other businesses of the parties, (iv) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of representations and warranties with respect to the parties respective businesses, (v) the maintenance of asset-based fees generated by BGI with respect to all clients and with respect to exchange traded funds, in each case at 75% or more of their levels at April 30, 2009, (vi) compliance with Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as provided in the Barclays Purchase Agreement, (vii) the execution by the other party (or its affiliates) of specified ancillary agreements and (viii) the receipt of various necessary governmental approvals and consents. BlackRocks obligation to consummate the Acquisition is further subject to (a) the retention of a specified percentage of certain key employees and (b) BGIs unaudited financial statements for fiscal year 2008 (which have already been delivered to BlackRock in connection with the signing of the Barclays Purchase Agreement) and BGIs audited financial statements for fiscal year 2008 (which will be delivered to BlackRock prior to closing of the Acquisition) not differing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect. Consummation of the Acquisition is not subject to the receipt of financing by BlackRock. Stockholders of BlackRock representing greater than a majority of the shares of the outstanding capital stock of BlackRock have executed written consents in lieu of a meeting approving the issuance of shares in connection with the Acquisition as described herein.
 
Additionally, BlackRock has agreed to increase the size of its Board of Directors from 17 directors to 19 directors immediately prior to the closing of the Acquisition and to cause such vacancies to be filled by designees of Barclays.
 
The Barclays Purchase Agreement contains customary indemnification obligations for transactions of this type of each party with respect to breaches of representations, warranties and covenants and certain other specified
 
 
 
matters. In addition, Barclays has agreed to indemnify BlackRock in connection with losses relating to certain of Barclays pension funds, any breach by Barclays of certain regulatory requirements and fiduciary requirements, including arising out of investment advisory contracts with clients, and certain differences between the operating expenses indicated on BGIs unaudited financial statements as compared to BGIs audited financial statements. The indemnification obligations of the parties are subject to minimum and maximum dollar thresholds in certain cases as set forth in the Barclays Purchase Agreement.
 
The foregoing description of the Barclays Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Barclays Purchase Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and which is hereby incorporated into this Form 8-K by reference.
 
The Barclays Purchase Agreement has been included to provide investors and security holders with information regarding its terms.

Under the terms of this agreement, the closing of the sale of the Financing Preferred Shares will occur simultaneously with, and is conditioned on, the closing of the Acquisition, as well as other customary conditions.

In addition, as described above, BlackRock and PNC entered into the PNC Stock Purchase Agreement for the private placement of the Financing Preferred Shares (the Financing Preferred Shares, and together with the Financing Common Shares, the Financing Shares).

After such payment to the holders of Series D Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of any other series of BlackRocks preferred stock ranking prior to the Common Stock as to distributions upon liquidation, the remaining assets of BlackRock will be distributed pro rata to the holders of Series D Preferred Stock and any other series of BlackRocks preferred stock ranking prior to the Common Stock as to distributions upon liquidation that participate
