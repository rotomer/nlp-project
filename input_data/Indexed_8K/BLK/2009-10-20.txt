On October 14, 2009, BlackRock, Inc. (the Company) entered into a commercial paper program (the Program) under which the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the Notes) on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3,000,000,000. The proceeds of the commercial paper issuances will be used for general corporate purposes. Amounts available under the Program may be reborrowed.
Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Banc of America Securities LLC will act as dealers under the Program (collectively, the Dealers) pursuant to the terms and conditions of their respective Commercial Paper Dealer Agreements with the Company (each, a Dealer Agreement).  JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, will act as issuing and paying agent under the Program.
The Program provides the terms under which the Dealers will either purchase from the Company or arrange for the sale by the Company of Notes pursuant to an exemption from federal and state securities laws. The Program contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnification provisions.
The maturities of the Notes will vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The Notes will be sold at a discount from par or, alternatively, will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market conditions at the time of the issuance of the Notes. The rates of interest will depend on whether the Notes will be fixed or floating rate. The interest on a floating rate may be based on the following: (a) CD rate; (b) commercial paper rate; (c) federal funds rate; (d) LIBOR; (e) prime rate; (f) treasury rate; or (g) such other base rate as may be specified in a supplement.
The Program contains certain events of default including, among other things: non-payment of principal, interest or fees; violation of covenants; invalidity of any loan document; material judgments; and bankruptcy and insolvency events, subject in certain instances to cure periods.
A copy of the Dealer Agreement between BlackRock, Inc. and Barclays Capital Inc., dated as of October 14, 2009, is attached to this report as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated by reference as though it was fully set forth herein. In accordance with Instruction 2 to Item 601 of Regulation S-K, the Company is filing only one commercial paper dealer agreement, as the other agreements are substantially identical in all material respects except as to the parties thereto and the notice provisions. The description above is a summary of the Program and is qualified in its entirety by the Dealer Agreements.

In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all documents submitted to us as originals, and the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies.

Further Provisions Relating to Indemnification
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Exhibit C
 
Statement of Terms for Interest  Bearing Commercial Paper Notes of [Name of Issuer]
 
THE PROVISIONS SET FORTH BELOW ARE QUALIFIED TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE BY THE TRANSACTION SPECIFIC [PRICING] [PRIVATE PLACEMENT MEMORANDUM] SUPPLEMENT (THE SUPPLEMENT) (IF ANY) SENT TO EACH PURCHASER AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION.
 
 
 
 
(b) Business Day means any day other than a Saturday or Sunday that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law, executive order or regulation to be closed in New York City and, with respect to LIBOR Notes (as defined below) is also a London Business Day. London Business Day means, a day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
 
 
 
 
(b) The Supplement sent to each holder of such Note will describe the following terms: (i) whether such Note is a Fixed Rate Note or a Floating Rate Note and whether such Note is an Original Issue Discount Note (as defined below); (ii) the date on which such Note will be issued (the Issue Date); (iii) the Stated Maturity Date (as defined below); (iv) if such Note is a Fixed Rate Note, the rate per annum at which such Note will bear interest, if any, and the Interest Payment Dates; (v) if such Note is a Floating Rate Note, the Base Rate, the Index Maturity, the Interest Reset Dates, the Interest Payment Dates and the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any (all as defined below), and any other terms relating to the particular method of calculating the interest rate for such Note; and (vi) any other terms applicable specifically to such Note. Original Issue Discount Note means a Note which has a stated redemption price at the Stated Maturity Date that exceeds its Issue Price by more than a specified de minimis amount and which the Supplement indicates will be an Original Issue Discount Note.
 
 
(c) Each Fixed Rate Note will bear interest from its Issue Date at the rate per annum specified in the Supplement until the principal amount thereof is paid or made available for payment. Interest on each Fixed Rate Note will be payable on the dates specified in the Supplement (each an Interest Payment Date for a Fixed Rate Note) and on the Maturity Date (as defined below). Interest on Fixed Rate Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
 
 
If any Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date of a Fixed Rate Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the required payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest will be payable on the next succeeding Business Day, and no additional interest will accrue in respect of the payment made on that next succeeding Business Day.
 
 
 
 
 
(d) The interest rate on each Floating Rate Note for each Interest Reset Period (as defined below) will be determined by reference to an interest rate basis (a Base Rate) plus or minus a number of basis points (one basis point equals one-hundredth of a percentage point) (the Spread), if any, and/or multiplied by a certain percentage (the Spread Multiplier), if any, until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment. The Supplement will designate which of the following Base Rates is applicable to the related Floating Rate Note: (a) the CD Rate (a CD Rate Note), (b) the Commercial Paper Rate (a Commercial Paper Rate Note), (c) the Federal Funds Rate (a Federal Funds Rate Note), (d) LIBOR (a LIBOR Note), (e) the Prime Rate (a Prime Rate Note), (f) the Treasury Rate (a Treasury Rate Note) or (g) such other Base Rate as may be specified in such Supplement.
 
 
The rate of interest on each Floating Rate Note will be reset daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly or semi-annually (the Interest Reset Period). The date or dates on which interest will be reset (each an Interest Reset Date) will be, unless otherwise specified in the Supplement, in the case of Floating Rate Notes which reset daily, each Business Day, in the case of Floating Rate Notes (other than Treasury Rate Notes) that reset weekly, the Wednesday of each week; in the case of Treasury Rate Notes that reset weekly, the Tuesday of each week; in the case of Floating Rate Notes that reset monthly, the third Wednesday of each month; in the case of Floating Rate Notes that reset quarterly, the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December; and in the case of Floating Rate Notes that reset semiannually, the third Wednesday of the two months specified in the Supplement. If any Interest Reset Date for any Floating Rate Note is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that in the case of a LIBOR Note, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. Interest on each Floating Rate Note will be payable monthly, quarterly or semiannually (the Interest Payment Period) and on the Maturity Date. Unless otherwise specified in the Supplement, and except as provided below, the date or dates on which interest will be payable (each an Interest Payment Date for a Floating Rate Note) will be, in the case of Floating Rate Notes with a monthly Interest Payment Period, on the third Wednesday of each month; in the case of Floating Rate Notes with a quarterly Interest Payment Period, on the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December; and in the case of Floating Rate Notes with a semiannual Interest Payment Period, on the third Wednesday of the two months specified in the Supplement. In addition, the Maturity Date will also be an Interest Payment Date.
 
 
If any Interest Payment Date for any Floating Rate Note (other than an Interest Payment Date occurring on the Maturity Date) would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that in the case of a LIBOR Note, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. If the Maturity Date of a Floating Rate Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal and interest will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after such maturity.
 
 
Interest payments on each Interest Payment Date for Floating Rate Notes will include accrued interest from and including the Issue Date or from and including the last date in respect of which interest has been paid, as the case may be, to, but excluding, such Interest Payment Date. On the Maturity Date, the interest payable on a Floating Rate Note will include interest accrued to, but excluding, the Maturity Date. Accrued interest will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of a Floating Rate Note by an accrued interest factor. This accrued interest factor will be
 
 
 
 
computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each day in the period for which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor (expressed as a decimal) for each such day will be computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to such day by 360, in the cases where the Base Rate is the CD Rate, Commercial Paper Rate, Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR or Prime Rate, or by the actual number of days in the year, in the case where the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate. The interest rate in effect on each day will be (i) if such day is an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with respect to the Interest Determination Date (as defined below) pertaining to such Interest Reset Date, or (ii) if such day is not an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with respect to the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the next preceding Interest Reset Date, subject in either case to any adjustment by a Spread and/or a Spread Multiplier.
 
 
The Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is the CD Rate or the Commercial Paper Rate will be the second Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date. The Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate will be the Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date. The Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is LIBOR will be the second London Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date. The Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate will be the day of the week in which such Interest Reset Date falls when Treasury Bills are normally auctioned. Treasury Bills are normally sold at auction on Monday of each week, unless that day is a legal holiday, in which case the auction is held on the following Tuesday or the preceding Friday. If an auction is so held on the preceding Friday, such Friday will be the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the Interest Reset Date occurring in the next succeeding week.
 
 
The Index Maturity is the period to maturity of the instrument or obligation from which the applicable Base Rate is calculated.
 
 
The Calculation Date, where applicable, shall be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day following the applicable Interest Determination Date or (ii) the Business Day preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity Date.
 
 
All times referred to herein reflect New York City time, unless otherwise specified.
 
 
The Issuer shall specify in writing to the Issuing and Paying Agent which party will be the calculation agent (the Calculation Agent) with respect to the Floating Rate Notes. The Calculation Agent will provide the interest rate then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate which will become effective on the next Interest Reset Date with respect to such Floating Rate Note to the Issuing and Paying Agent as soon as the interest rate with respect to such Floating Rate Note has been determined and as soon as practicable after any change in such interest rate.
 
 
All percentages resulting from any calculation on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five-one millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards. For example, 9.876545% (or .09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655). All dollar amounts used in or resulting from any calculation on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded, in the case of U.S. dollars, to the nearest cent or, in the case of a foreign currency, to the nearest unit (with one-half cent or unit being rounded upwards).
 
 
CD Rate Notes
 
CD Rate means the rate on any Interest Determination Date for negotiable certificates of deposit having the Index Maturity as published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB) in Statistical Release H.15(519), Selected Interest Rates or any successor publication of the FRB (H.15(519)) under the heading CDs (Secondary Market).
 
 
 
 
If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the CD Rate will be the rate on such Interest Determination Date set forth in the daily update of H.15(519), available through the world wide website of the FRB at or any successor site or publication or other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying the applicable rate (H.15 Daily Update) under the caption CDs (Secondary Market).
http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/Update,
 
 
If such rate is not published in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the CD Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of 10:00 a.m. on such Interest Determination Date of three leading nonbank dealers
in negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit of major United States money center banks of the highest credit standing in the market for negotiable certificates of deposit with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity in the denomination of $5,000,000.
5
 
 
If the dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as set forth above, the CD Rate will remain the CD Rate then in effect on such Interest Determination Date.
 
 
Commercial Paper Rate Notes
 
Commercial Paper Rate means the Money Market Yield (calculated as described below) of the rate on any Interest Determination Date for commercial paper having the Index Maturity, as published in H.15(519) under the heading Commercial Paper-Nonfinancial.
 
 
If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, then the Commercial Paper Rate will be the Money Market Yield of the rate on such Interest Determination Date for commercial paper of the Index Maturity as published in H.15 Daily Update under the heading Commercial Paper-Nonfinancial.
 
 
If by 3:00 p.m. on such Calculation Date such rate is not published in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update, then the Calculation Agent will determine the Commercial Paper Rate to be the Money Market Yield of the arithmetic mean of the offered rates as of 11:00 a.m. on such Interest
 
 
Determination Date of three leading dealers of U.S. dollar commercial paper in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent for commercial paper of the Index Maturity placed for an industrial issuer whose bond rating is AA, or the equivalent, from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.
 
 
If the dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned above, the Commercial Paper Rate with respect to such Interest Determination Date will remain the Commercial Paper Rate then in effect on such Interest Determination Date.
 
 
Money Market Yield will be a yield calculated in accordance with the following formula:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
where D refers to the applicable per annum rate for commercial paper quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal and M refers to the actual number of days in the interest period for which interest is being calculated.
 
 
Federal Funds Rate Notes
 
Federal Funds Rate means the rate on any Interest Determination Date for Federal Funds as published in Reuters (or any successor service) on page FEDFUNDS1 under the heading EFFECT (or any other page as may replace the specified page on that service) (Reuters Page FEDFUNDS1).
 
 
If the above rate does not appear on Reuters Page FEDFUNDS1 or is not so published by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Federal Funds Rate will be the rate on such Interest Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily Update under the heading Federal Funds/(Effective).
 
 
If such rate is not published as described above by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the Federal Funds Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight U.S. dollar federal funds arranged by each of three leading brokers of Federal Funds transactions in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent prior to 9:00 a.m. on such Interest Determination Date.
 
 
If the brokers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned above, the Federal Funds Rate will remain the Federal Funds Rate then in effect on such Interest Determination Date.
 
 
LIBOR Notes
 
The London Interbank offered rate (LIBOR) means, with respect to any Interest Determination Date, the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having the Index Maturity that appears on the Designated LIBOR Page as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date.
 
 
If no rate appears, LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date at which deposits in U.S. dollars are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in such market selected by the Calculation Agent for a term equal to the Index Maturity and in principal amount equal to an amount that in the Calculation Agents judgment is representative for a single transaction in U.S. dollars in such market at such time (a Representative Amount). The Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of such banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two such quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR for such interest period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., in New York City, on such Interest Determination Date by three major banks in New York City, selected by the Calculation Agent, for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks, for a term equal to the Index Maturity and in a Representative Amount; provided, however, that if fewer than three banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are providing such quotations, the then existing LIBOR rate will remain in effect for such Interest Payment Period.
 
 
Designated LIBOR Page means Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page or any replacement page or pages on which London interbank rates of major banks for the Index Currency are displayed.
 
 
 
 
Prime Rate Notes
 
Prime Rate means the rate on any Interest Determination Date as published in H.15(519) under the heading Bank Prime Loan.
 
 
If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) prior to 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, then the Prime Rate will be the rate on such Interest Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily Update opposite the caption Bank Prime Loan.
 
 
If the rate is not published prior to 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update, then the Calculation Agent will determine the Prime Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the rates of interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on the Reuters Screen US PRIME1 Page (as defined below) as such banks prime rate or base lending rate as of 11:00 a.m., on that Interest Determination Date.
 
 
If fewer than four such rates referred to above are so published by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the Prime Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the prime rates or base lending rates quoted on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by 360 as of the close of business on such Interest Determination Date by three major banks in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent.
 
 
If the banks selected are not quoting as mentioned above, the Prime Rate will remain the Prime Rate in effect on such Interest Determination Date.
 
 
Reuters Screen US Prime1 Page means the display designated as page USPrime1 of the Reuters Service, or any successor service, or any replacement page or pages on that service, for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major U.S. banks.
 
 
Treasury Rate Notes
 
Treasury Rate means:
 
 
(1) the rate from the auction held on the Interest Determination Date (the Auction) of direct obligations of the United States (Treasury Bills) having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable pricing supplement above under the caption INVESTMENT RATE, as that rate appears on Reuters Screen USAUCTION10 or USAUCTION11 Page under the heading Investment Rate (or any other page as may replace the specified page on that service or a successor service), or
