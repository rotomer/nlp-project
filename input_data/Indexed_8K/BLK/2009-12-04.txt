The Shareholders and Board of Directors
Barclays PLC
In our opinion, the accompanying combined balance sheets and the related combined statements of income and other comprehensive income, of invested equity, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Barclays Global Investors (BGI), as defined in Note 1 to the combined financial statements, at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of BGI's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

1. Introduction and Basis of Presentation
Basis of Presentation
On June 16, 2009, the Board of Barclays PLC (BPLC) announced it accepted the offer of BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock) to purchase certain legal entities and assets and liabilities of Barclays Global Investors (BGI) (the Transaction). The legal entities and assets and liabilities of BGI included in the Transaction will be referred to as the Company throughout this document.
The Company had no separate legal status or existence and historically did not prepare combined financial statements. The combined historical financial information included herein was prepared specifically for the purpose of facilitating the Transaction and includes the historical basis in assets and liabilities and the historical results of operations of each of the entities constituting the Company as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 and as of September 30, 2009 and 2008 and for the nine-month periods then ended.
The Company comprises the following entities, which are included in the Transaction and whose operations are under the common control of BPLC.
 
 
1. Introduction and Basis of Presentation (continued)
 
In addition to the entities listed in the table above, these combined financial statements include the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of funds required to be consolidated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 46(R), (FIN 46(R)) (ASC 810-10, ). For further discussion of the consolidated funds, refer to Note 7, Variable Interest Entities.

No single customer accounts for more than 10% of the Company's revenues.
 
1. Introduction and Basis of Presentation (continued)
 
Previously, the Company had presented its combined statements of cash flows to reconcile net (loss) income attributable to shareholders of BGI to cash flows provided from (used in) operations. The Company has revised its presentation of the combined statement of cash flows to reconcile total net income to cash flows provided from (used in) operations. This change has no impact on previously reported results of operations, working capital or stockholders' equity of the Company.
These combined financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), for purposes of the Transaction, and include the accounts of the combined entities and their consolidated subsidiaries. The preparation of these combined financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures of assets and liabilities and contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Additionally, management's estimates impact the determination of the provision for income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The combined financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008 have been updated from those that had been previously audited to reflect the revised presentation of non-controlling interests as a result of the adoption of SFAS 160, (SFAS 160) (ASC 810-10, ) on January 1, 2009. The interim combined financial statements for the periods ended September 30, 2008 and 2009 have not been audited. Management believes that all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of results, consisting of normally recurring items, have been included in the unaudited combined financial statements for the interim periods presented.
Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements
Consolidation
The combined financial statements include all historical assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows of the entities included in the Transaction, and those of their consolidated subsidiaries, even if certain of those assets, liabilities and consolidated subsidiaries of included entities have been excluded from the Transaction. Certain legal entities that have historically been included in the Barclays Bank PLC (BBPLC) segment reporting have been excluded from the combined financial statements as they are excluded from the Transaction.
Certain of the Company's sponsored investment funds are included in the combined financial statements of the Company. Consequently, the combined financial statements of the Company reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows of these consolidated funds on a gross basis. The majority economic ownership interests in these funds are not owned by the
 
1. Introduction and Basis of Presentation (continued)
Company and are therefore reflected as non-controlling interests in the combined financial statements.
The combined financial information included herein may not necessarily be indicative of the Company's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in the future or what its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would have been had the Company been a stand-alone company during the periods presented.
Transactions and balances between entities included within these combined financial statements have been eliminated. Transactions and balances between the Company and BBPLC and its subsidiaries have been separately identified as related-party transactions in the appropriate caption of the combined financial statements to which such transactions and balances relate. Refer to Note 12, Related-Party Transactions.
In preparing the accompanying financial statements, and in accordance with the recently issued SFAS No. 165 [ASC 855-10], the Company's management has evaluated subsequent events through November 20, 2009, which is the date that the financial statements were issued.
Subsequent Events
Business
The Company is one of the world's largest asset managers and a leading global provider of investment management products and services. The Company is also the global leader in assets and products in the exchange-traded funds business with 360 funds for institutions and individuals trading globally. The Company's investment philosophy is founded on managing all dimensions of performance with a consistent focus on controlling risk, return, and costs.
2. Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
The Company earns management fees from clients for investment management and advisory services. Management fees earned by the Company are primarily based on the level of assets under management and the negotiated fee schedule for each account as set forth in the underlying investment advisory contract. Fees are generally calculated and billed on a monthly or quarterly basis and are accounted for on an accrual basis. Incentive fees, if any, are recognized when locked at the end of the relevant performance period, pursuant to the management advisory contract. As investment management and incentive fees earned by the Company are based
 
2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
primarily upon assets under management, changes in the value of these assets will have an impact on the fees earned by the Company in future periods.
The Company also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. Such revenues are accounted for on an accrual basis. The security loans are secured by collateral, principally cash, ranging from 102% to 108% of the value of the securities. The net income earned on the collateral is shared between the Company and funds or other third-party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed.
The Company also earns agency commissions from acting as a broker-dealer in buying and selling securities for its customers. Commissions and related clearing expenses are recorded on a trade-date basis as securities transactions occur.
As discussed in Note 7, Variable Interest Entities, the Company has determined it is the primary beneficiary of certain funds as a result of its obligation under certain cash support arrangements. The consolidated funds primarily generate revenue through investment activities with net investment income being distributed to participating accounts. Trading gains and losses generated by the consolidated funds are reflected in "Trading (loss) gain from consolidated funds" in the combined statements of income and other comprehensive income, and interest income earned by the funds is reflected as "Interest income from consolidated funds" in the combined statements of income and other comprehensive income. Interest income is accounted for on the accrual basis and securities transactions are accounted for on the trade date. The cost of securities or cost of units sold, and any resulting gain or loss is accounted for on a first-in, first-out basis.
Non-Controlling Interests
Non-controlling interests on the combined statements of income and other comprehensive income includes the income (loss) allocated to non-controlling interest holders of the Company's consolidated sponsored investment funds. Non-controlling interests are not adjusted for taxes on consolidated sponsored investment funds that are treated as pass-through entities for tax purposes.
The non-controlling interests are redeemable at the option of the security holders. As a result, the non-controlling interests have been reclassified to temporary equity ("mezzanine" equity) for the purposes of complying with SEC Regulation S-X. This reclassification resulted in a decrease to the previously reported amounts of equity by $75,455, $69,211, and $81,121 (unaudited) at December 31, 2008 and 2007 and September 30, 2009, respectively. The corresponding amounts
 
2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
increased mezzanine equity for each respective period. The reclassification had no impact on previously reported results of operations, working capital or total assets or liabilities of the Company.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are AAA rated. Due to the short-term nature and liquidity of cash and cash equivalents, the carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
Interest income earned from cash and cash equivalents and other short-term investments are recorded on an accrual basis as interest and dividend income.
Consolidation
The accounting method used for the Company's equity investments is generally dependent upon the degree of influence the Company has over the investee. For investments where the Company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into the Company's financial statements. For certain investments where the risk and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities, or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if the Company, with its related parties, is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The primary beneficiary determination will consider not only the Company's equity interest, but the benefits and risks associated with non-equity components of the Company's relationship with the investee, including capital support agreements, debt, investment advisory and other similar arrangements, in accordance with FIN 46(R) (ASC 810-10, ).
Consolidation
Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04-5 (ASC 810-20, ), for entities that are not deemed to be VIEs, but for which the Company is a general partner or managing member of its funds, the Company is generally presumed to control the funds. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if the presumption of control can be overcome by determining if third-party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove the Company as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights.

Investments
Investments in Debt and Marketable Equity Securities
The Company's investments are classified as trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity based on the Company's intent to sell the security or, for a debt security, the Company's intent and ability to hold the debt security to maturity, pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115, .
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities (ASC 320-10, Investment  Debt and Equity Securities)
Trading assets consist primarily of marketable investments in debt securities and mutual funds and assets held by consolidated variable interest entities. Trading securities are those investments that are purchased principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term or those assets for which the Company has elected the fair value option under SFAS No. 159, . Trading securities are carried at fair value on the combined balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded in trading (loss) gain from consolidated funds and fair value (loss) on investments in the combined statements of income and other comprehensive income during the period of the change.
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159) (ASC 825-10, Financial Instruments)
Available-for-sale securities are those investments that are not classified as trading assets or held-to-maturity. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value on the combined balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded in the combined statements of invested equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available-for-sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from other comprehensive income to other income/expense on the Company's combined statements of income and other comprehensive income. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at amortized cost in the combined balance sheets and periodically evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment losses, which are recorded in other income/expense on the Company's combined statements of income and other comprehensive income.
The Company also earns investment income, which includes dividends and net fair value gains (losses) on investments. Interest income is recorded using the effective-yield method. Dividends are recorded on the date on which the shares are quoted ex-dividend.
 
2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Equity Method Investments
For equity investments where the Company does not control the investee and where it is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company's share of the investee's underlying net income or loss is recorded in other income/expense in the combined statements of income and other comprehensive income. The net income of the investee is recorded based upon the most current information available at the time. Distributions received from the investment reduce the Company's investment balance.
Separate Account Assets and Liabilities
A wholly owned entity within the Company in the United Kingdom is a registered life insurance company that has financial assets held for customers under investment contracts that have matching investment contract liabilities that are linked to the changes in fair value of these assets. The Company issues investment contracts without fixed terms. Investment contracts without fixed terms are financial liabilities whose fair value is dependent on the fair value of underlying financial assets and derivatives ("unit-linked") and are measured at fair value with gains and losses recorded through the combined statements of income and other comprehensive income. Unit-linked investment contracts are typically saving products, where the saver (also known as policyholder) invests either a regular amount or a single lump sum, which in turn is invested by the Company into various types of assets (primarily equity securities and bonds). The Company will issue units to the policyholder, whose value is "linked" to the performance of the assets.
These unit-linked investment contracts are maintained as separate accounts. The separate account assets are not subject to general claims of the creditors of the Company. These accounts, and the related liabilities, are recorded as separate account assets and separate account liabilities in the combined balance sheets. The net investment income and realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to separate account assets supporting individual and group pension contracts accrue directly to the contract owner and are offset within the same line item in the combined statements of income and other comprehensive income. Policy administration and management fees associated with separate account products are included in investment advisory and administration fees in the combined statements of income and other comprehensive income.
 
2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Fair Value Measures of Financial Assets
The Company adopted SFAS No. 157, (SFAS 157) (ASC 820-10, ), on January 1, 2008. SFAS 157 (ASC 820-10, ) establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under SFAS 157 (ASC 820-10, ) are as follows:
Fair Value Measurements
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
 
In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the determination of which category within the fair value hierarchy is appropriate for any given investment is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. However, the determination of what constitutes an "observable" input requires significant judgment by the Company. The Company considers observable inputs to be market data that is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable, and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market. The categorization of a value determined for a financial instrument within the hierarchy is based upon the pricing transparency of the instrument and does not necessarily correspond to the Company's perceived risk of that instrument.
 
2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
In determining the level within the hierarchy within which the value determined for a financial instrument falls, the Company separates the investment portfolio into three categories: securities, funds, and other financial instruments.
Valuation of the Company's investments is generally determined as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Level 1
Investments whose values are based on quoted market prices in active markets, and whose values are therefore classified within Level 1, include active listed securities. The Company does not adjust quoted prices for such instruments, even in situations where the fund holds a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price.
The net asset value per share of a mutual fund is calculated by dividing the fund's net asset value on the calculation date by the number of shares of the fund that are outstanding on the calculation date. The number of shares of the mutual fund that are outstanding on the calculation date is derived from observable purchase and redemption activity in the mutual fund. Accordingly, pursuant to SFAS 157 (ASC 820-10, ), the net asset value per share for a mutual fund is a Level 1 price.
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
 
2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Derivative instruments can be exchange-traded or privately negotiated over the counter (OTC). Values for exchange-traded derivatives, such as futures contracts, are typically classified as Level 1 prices.
Level 2
Investments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active but whose values are based on quoted market prices, dealer quotations or valuations provided by alternative pricing sources supported by observable inputs are classified as Level 2 prices. These may include US government, government agency securities, investment-grade corporate bonds, certain mortgage products, certain bank loans, medium-term notes, and repurchase agreements.
The value of a collective investment fund for which the Company is trustee is calculated by dividing the fund's net asset value on the calculation date by the number of units of the fund that are outstanding on the calculation date. The value is derived from observable purchase and sale activity in the collective investment fund. Accordingly, pursuant to SFAS 157 (ASC 820-10, ), the unit value for a collective investment fund is a Level 2 price.
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
OTC derivatives, including credit default swaps, total return swaps, and interest rate swaps, are valued using observable inputs, such as quotations received from the counterparty, whenever available and considered reliable. In instances where models are used, the value of an OTC derivative depends upon the contractual terms and specific risks inherent in the instrument as well as the availability and reliability of observable inputs. Such inputs may include market prices for reference securities, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs. Values for certain OTC derivatives, such as swaps, have inputs, which can generally be corroborated by market data and are therefore classified as Level 2 prices.
 
2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Level 3
Investments whose values are classified as Level 3 prices have significant unobservable inputs, as they trade infrequently or not at all. Level 3 prices may include less liquid corporate debt securities (including distressed debt instruments), collateralized debt obligations, and less liquid mortgage securities (backed by either commercial or residential real estate). When observable prices are not available for these securities, the Company uses the market approach to fair value investments, which reflects estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company considers indicative values obtained by independent pricing services and dealer quotations or utilizes information from other active parts of the market such as yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, credit spreads and debt prices to extrapolate an investment's fair value. Valuation techniques may also include use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. Assumptions used by the Company due to the lack of observable inputs may significantly impact the resulting fair value.
In circumstances where the Company has used a quotation provided by a counterparty for an OTC derivative, but cannot verify the model value through alternative resources, it is possible that a different valuation model could produce a materially different estimate on fair value. Those OTC derivatives that have less liquidity or for which inputs are unobservable are classified as Level 3 prices. The valuations of less liquid OTC derivatives may utilize some Level 1 and/or Level 2 price inputs, but also include other unobservable inputs which are considered significant to the fair value determination.
The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. For tabular disclosure of the Company financial instruments carried at fair value, see Note 5.
 
2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Fair Value Option
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159, (SFAS 159) (ASC 825-10, ) which permits entities to choose to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. The decision to elect the fair value option is determined on an instrument by instrument basis and must be applied to an entire instrument, and it is irrevocable once elected. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value pursuant to SFAS 159 are required to be reported separately in the combined balance sheets from those instruments measured using another accounting method. The Company adopted SFAS 159 on January 1, 2008. At that date, the Company elected not to apply the fair value option to any of its eligible financial assets or liabilities. Therefore, the initial adoption of SFAS 159 had no impact on the Company's combined financial statements. The Company elected the fair value option for certain eligible financial assets upon their initial recognition in 2008, and those assets have been reported in trading assets in the combined balance sheets.
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
Financial Instruments
Accounts Receivable, Net of Allowance for Credit Losses
In the event clients do not fulfill their obligations, the Company may be exposed to credit risk. The Company assesses the exposure to credit losses on a periodic basis and records a provision accordingly. Given their expected short-term nature, the carrying value of accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses, approximates fair value at the reporting date. The allowance for credit losses is considered a reasonable adjustment for credit risk for the portfolio.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of a business acquired in an acquisition. Goodwill is allocated to the reporting units based on the assignment of the fair values of each reporting unit of the acquired company. Intangible assets, net, primarily include distribution channels, brand name, licenses and other. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, (SFAS 142) (ASC 350-10, ), goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized. Intangible assets with finite-lives, such as the distribution channels, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Intangibles-Goodwill and Other
 
2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually during the fourth quarter, or in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value may be impaired. The Company assesses impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets periodically, and at least annually. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value. The determination of fair value includes considerations of projected cash flows and relevant trading multiples of comparable companies. There was no impairment of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 and for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008.
In accordance with SFAS 142, for finite-lived intangible assets subject to amortization, impairment is considered upon certain "triggering events" and is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset, in accordance with SFAS 144, ASC 360. There was no impairment of intangible assets in the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 and for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008.
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (
, Property, Plant and Equipment)
Furniture, Equipment, and Leasehold Improvements
Furniture, equipment, and leasehold improvements consist of furniture, fixtures, equipment, and leasehold improvements, which are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation or amortization. Depreciation of furniture, fixtures, equipment and computer software is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from 3 to 10 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the assets, ranging from 10-15 years, or the remaining term of the lease. Improvements are capitalized and maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
Capitalized Software Development Costs
The Company capitalizes software costs in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1, (SOP 98-1) (ASC 350-40, ) SOP 98-1 requires the capitalization of internal use computer software if certain criteria are met. The Company amortizes the capitalized costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives, not to exceed five years.

The Company expenses the costs of advertising as incurred. Advertising expense was $118, $93 and $74 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively and $64 (unaudited) and $75 (unaudited) for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Leases
The Company accounts for its operating leases in accordance with SFAS No. 13, (SFAS 13) (ASC 840-10, ). The Company expenses the lease payments associated with operating leases during the lease term (including free-rent periods), beginning on commencement of the lease term.

Stock-Based Compensation
The Company's employees participate in various performance compensation and stock incentive plans sponsored by the Company or BPLC.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), (SFAS 123(R)) (ASC 718-10, ). The Company adopted SFAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006. This statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, primarily focusing on the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions. Entities are required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. The cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service (usually the vesting period) in exchange for the award. There was no cumulative effect adjustment as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123(R). See Note 10, Employee Compensation and Benefits, for further discussion.

Foreign Currency Translation
Monetary assets and liabilities of subsidiaries having non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities of subsidiaries having non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at historical exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in other comprehensive income, a separate component of invested equity on the combined balance sheets. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in other income on the combined statements of income and other comprehensive income.
Derivative Instruments
SFAS No. 133, Activities (SFAS 133) (ASC 815-10, ), as amended, established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivatives embedded in other contracts. SFAS 133 generally requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the combined balance sheet and to measure those investments at fair value.
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Derivatives and Hedging
The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes, and does not designate any derivative instruments as hedging instruments. Derivative instruments are used in certain of the VIEs which the Company consolidates and in the separate accounts as part of the investing strategy, and those instruments are recorded on the combined balance sheets at their fair values.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 109, (SFAS 109) (ASC 740-10, ). SFAS 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the tax basis and the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the existing tax rate applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the benefits of net deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carry forwards will not be realized.

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FIN 48, (FIN 48) (ASC 740-10, ) and FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. 48-1, (FSP 48-1). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on the derecognition, classification, and disclosure of tax positions, as well as the accounting for related interest and penalties. FSP 48-1 provides guidance associated with the criteria that must be evaluated in determining if a tax position has been effectively settled and should be recognized as a tax benefit.

The Company's adoption of FIN 48 and FSP 48-1 effective January 1, 2007, resulted in no net change in beginning retained earnings as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principal.
Refer to Note 11 for additional information about the Company's unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company's operating results have historically been included in BBPLC's consolidated financial results. The provisions for income taxes in the combined financial statements have been determined as if the Company were a separate tax payor.
3. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification or ASC) as the sole source of authoritative, nongovernmental GAAP, except for rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which remain authoritative for SEC registrants. The FASB will no longer issue new standards in the form of Statements, FASB Staff Positions, or Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts. Instead it will issue Accounting Standard Updates (ASU). An ASU will not be considered authoritative in its own right, but will serve to update the conclusion on the change(s) in the Codification. As the Codification is not intended to change or alter existing GAAP, the Company's adoption of the Codification effective September 30, 2009 had no impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Technical references to GAAP in these notes to the financial statements are provided using the new ASC numbering system.
 
3. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements (continued)
 
 In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141(R) (ASC 805-20, ) which revised SFAS 141, SFAS 141(R) significantly changed how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods. SFAS 141(R) will require:
SFAS 141(R),
Business Combinations

Business Combinations
Business Combinations.
 
 
 
SFAS 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The adoption on January 1, 2009 of SFAS 141(R) did not materially impact the Company's combined financial statements.
 This statement was issued in December 2007 and amends ARB No. 51. SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary and clarifies that a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity separate from the parent's equity in consolidated financial statements. In addition, consolidated net income should be adjusted to include the net income attributed to the non controlling interests. The Company adopted SFAS 160 on January 1, 2009. SFAS 160 required retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing non-controlling interests. All other requirements of SFAS 160 shall be applied prospectively. The adoption of SFAS 160 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the combined financial statements.

SFAS 161 also requires disclosure of the fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format. The Company adopted SFAS 161 on January 1, 2009. The adoption on January 1, 2009 of SFAS 161 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the combined financial statements.
 In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS 165 which establishes general standards of accounting for, and requires disclosure of, events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. The Company adopted SFAS 165 on June 30, 2009. The adoption of SFAS 165 did not have a material effect on the Company's combined financial statements.

 On June 12, 2009, the FASB issued SFAS 167, which amends the consolidation guidance for VIEs under FIN 46(R. The amendments include: 1) the elimination of the exemption from consolidation for qualifying special purpose entities, 2) a new approach for determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE, which requires that the primary beneficiary have both (i) the power to control the most significant activities of the VIE and (ii) either the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE, and 3) the requirement to continually reassess who should consolidate a VIE. SFAS 167 is effective as of the beginning of an entity's first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, for interim periods within that first annual reporting period, and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter. The Company is evaluating the impact of SFAS 167 on its combined financial statements.

 On June 12, 2009, the FASB issued SFAS 166 in response to the FASB's concerns about how practice has developed under SFAS No. 140, (SFAS 140) as well as concerns expressed by constituents that certain transfers of financial assets should not qualify as sales under SFAS 140. The most significant amendments resulting from SFAS 166 consist of the removal of the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity from SFAS 140. SFAS 166 is effective January 1, 2010, for calendar-year reporting entities. Earlier application is prohibited. The Company does not expect SFAS 166 to have a significant impact on its combined financial statements.

This FSP, which was issued in April 2008, amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142. FSP FAS 142-3 requires that an entity shall consider its own experience in renewing similar arrangements. This statement is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of an intangible asset determined under SFAS 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS 141(R) and other GAAP. FSP FAS 142-3 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption on January 1, 2009 of FSP FAS 142-3 did not have a significant impact on the Company's combined financial statements.

The adoption of the provisions of FSP FAS 157-2 as of January 1, 2009 for non-recurring non-financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on the Company's combined financial statements.
 On April 9, 2009, the FASB released FSP FAS 157-4 contemporaneously with FSP FAS 115-2 and FSP FAS 107-1. FSP FAS 157-4 amends SFAS 157 (ASC 820-10, ), to provide additional guidance on estimating fair value when the volume and level of transaction activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability. The FSP also provides additional guidance on circumstances that may indicate that a transaction is not orderly. FSP FAS 157-4, as well as the related FSP issued on the same day, FSP FAS 107-1, also requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements in annual and interim reporting periods. FSP FAS 157-4 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009. Early adoption is permitted, but only for periods ending after March 15, 2009.

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
ASU 2009-05 was issued in August 2009 and provides clarification regarding the consideration of restrictions when estimating the fair value of a liability. ASU 2009-05 requires that the fair value of a liability be measured using one of the noted approaches when a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available, which is expected to maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. ASU 2009-05 is effective for the first reporting period (including interim periods) beginning after its issuance, with earlier application permitted if financial statements for prior periods have not been issued. In the period of adoption, entities must disclose any change in valuation technique and related inputs resulting from the application of the amendments in ASU 2009-05, and quantify the total effect, if practicable. Revisions resulting from a change in the valuation technique or its application must be included in changes in fair value in the period of adoption. The adoption of ASU 2009-05 did not have a material impact on the Company's combined financial statements.

Impact of Consolidated Investment Funds
As discussed further in Note 7, the Company consolidated certain investment funds beginning in December 2007. The investments owned by these consolidated investment funds are classified as trading or other investments.

The Company adopted the provisions of on January 1, 2009. The new requirement amends and expands the disclosure requirement related to derivative instruments, to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of the use of derivative instruments by the Company and how these derivatives affect the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Company. This Statement requires qualitative disclosures about the objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments, quantitative disclosures about the fair value of, and gains and losses on, derivative instruments, as well as disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements.
SFAS 161,
Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 161) (
ASC 815-10
, Derivatives and Hedging)
As discussed in Note 2, the Company does not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purpose, and does not designate any derivative instruments as hedging instruments. Derivative instruments are used in certain of the VIEs which the Company consolidates and in the separate accounts as part of the investing strategy, and those instruments are recorded on the combined balance sheets at their fair values.
The consolidated VIEs and separate accounts invest in securities with contractual cash flows, and the cash flows, liquidity, income and values of such securities are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates, economic conditions, including real estate values, and actual and perceived changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer. The consolidated VIEs enter into derivative transactions to create synthetic cash exposures or manage their interest rate or credit risk; these transactions include interest rate swaps, total return swaps and credit default swaps. Similarly, the separate accounts include interest rate swaps and inflation swaps that are entered into in order to create synthetic cash exposures or manage interest rate risk. The VIEs and separate accounts enter into credit default swaps to simulate long and short bond positions that are either unavailable or considered to be less attractively priced in the bond market, and uses such swaps to reduce risk where there is an exposure to the issuer or to take an active long or short position with respect to the likelihood of an event default.
The capital support derivative agreements, which constitute credit derivates issued by the Company, are discussed further in Note 7.
The fair value of these derivative instruments are included as a separate line items in the Combined Balance Sheets, with changes in fair value included in the fair value gain (loss) on investments in the Combined Statements of Income.

6. Derivatives (continued)
 
Counterparty Credit Risk
By using derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to the counterparty's credit risk - the risk that derivative counterparties may not perform in accordance with the contractual provisions offset by the value of any collateral received. The Company's exposure to credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance is limited to the unrealized gains inherent in such transactions that are recognized in the Combined Statements of Income. The Company minimizes counterparty credit risk through credit limits and approvals, credit monitoring procedures, executing master netting arrangements and managing margin and collateral requirements, as appropriate. The Company records counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments, if material, on certain derivative assets in order to appropriately reflect the credit quality of the counterparty. These adjustments are also recorded on the market quotes received from counterparties or other market participants since these quotes may not fully reflect the credit risk of the counterparties to the derivative instruments.
Risks
The Company's consolidated sponsored investment funds invest in securities with contractual cash flows, such as asset backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and commercial mortgage backed securities, including securities backed by subprime mortgage loans. The value, liquidity and related income of these securities are sensitive to changes in economic conditions, including real estate value, delinquencies and/or defaults, and may be adversely affected by shifts in the market's perception of the issuers and changes in interest rates.
7. Variable Interest Entities
In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles and sponsored investment funds that may be considered VIEs. The Company receives management fees or other incentive-related fees for its services and may from time to time own equity or debt securities or enter into other contractual arrangements with the vehicles, each of which may be considered variable interests. The Company engages in these variable interests principally to address client needs through the launch of such investment vehicles or to otherwise facilitate the management of the vehicles. The VIEs are primarily financed via capital contributed by third-party investors. The Company's involvement in financing the operations of the VIEs is limited to its equity interests and its capital support agreements for certain funds.
 
7. Variable Interest Entities (continued)
 
The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity's expected losses, receives a majority of the entity's expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Under current guidance, it is unlikely that the Company will be the primary beneficiary for VIEs created to manage assets for clients unless its ownership interest in a VIE, including related-party interests, is substantial, unless the Company may earn significant performance fees from the VIE, or unless the Company has a significant non-management fee variable interest.
VIEs in which the Company holds significant variable interests or is the sponsor that holds a variable interest but is not the Primary Beneficiary of the VIE.
At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company's carrying value of assets and liabilities and its maximum risk of loss related to VIEs in which it holds a significant variable interest or is the sponsor that holds a variable interest, but for which it was not the primary beneficiary, were as follows:
As of December 31, 2008
 
The assets of the VIEs primarily comprise cash and cash equivalents and investments and the liabilities primarily comprise various accruals of the sponsored investment funds. At December 31, 2008, the Company's maximum risk of loss associated with these VIEs primarily relates to the Company's investment in the VIE.
 
7. Variable Interest Entities (continued)
 
As of December 31, 2007
 
The assets of the VIEs primarily comprise cash and cash equivalents and investments and the liabilities primarily comprise various accruals of the sponsored investment funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company's maximum risk of loss associated with these VIEs relates the Company's investment in the VIE.
At December 31, 2006 and September 30, 2009, the Company did not hold a significant interest in VIEs.
The Company also serves as investment manager for numerous investment vehicles which are VIEs in which it is not the primary beneficiary and does not have a significant variable interest. The total net assets of such entities are approximately $1.1 trillion as of December 31, 2008 and $0.8 trillion (unaudited) as of September 30, 2009. The Company's only interest in such VIEs is its management arrangement with the entities. The maximum risk of loss as of December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2009, consists solely of uncollected management fees and is not material.
 
7. Variable Interest Entities (continued)
 
VIEs in which the Company is the Primary Beneficiary
The Company has determined it is the primary beneficiary of certain funds as a result of concluding that it is expected to absorb the majority of the variability to cover expected losses in the funds due to its obligation under certain agreements entered into during the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009. Under these agreements, which constitute credit related derivates issued by the Company, the Company is indirectly obligated to make payments to the funds related to a defined pool of assets held by the funds under certain circumstances, including a payment default on a covered asset, a loss on restructuring of a covered asset, or in some cases a loss on the sale of a covered asset. The Company contributed $3 and $0 (unaudited) to the funds to cover realized losses and during the 12 months ended December 31, 2008 and the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009, respectively. The Company's obligation under the agreements is limited to a defined amount, which for some of the agreements increases or decreases over time. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, under the terms of the agreements, the Company was obligated to cover realized losses of up to $2,720 and $359, respectively, and the fair value of the Company's obligations under the agreements at December 31, 2008 and 2007, was $2,414 and $145, respectively. As of September 30, 2009, under the terms of the agreements, the Company was obligated to cover realized losses of up to $2,317 (unaudited), and their fair value of the Company's obligation under the agreements at September 30, 2009 was $1,252 (unaudited). There is no collateral requirement related to the Company's obligations under the agreements. The agreements expire at various dates through December 2013, and were entered into in order to partially support the funds' net asset value per unit.
The Company is not able to sell investments held by consolidated sponsored investments funds in order to obtain cash for use in its operations. Creditors of these VIEs do not have recourse to the Company.

Goodwill
The following table reflects the carrying value of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, and for nine months ended September 2009:
 
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of a business acquired.
In February 2007, the Company purchased all outstanding share capital of IndexChange from Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank AG Munich for EUR 241, or approximately $312. IndexChange was one of the largest European exchange traded funds (ETF) managers based in Munich and managed approximately 80 ETFs. IndexChange was an investment company as defined by the German Investment Act. The name of the acquired entity was changed to Barclays Global Investors (Deutschland) AG (BGIDAG) on October 2, 2007. In addition, capitalized costs of approximately EUR 4 relating to professional fees and other acquisitions costs were included as part of the purchase price. As of September 30, 2009, there were no goodwill impairment indicators to require the Company to perform an interim impairment analysis.

Additionally, the Company generated $134 of goodwill from its 1995 acquisition of BGI from Wells Fargo (WFNIA).
In May 2009, the Company acquired Naftrac de Nacional Financiera, S. N. C., Institucin de Banca de Desarrrollo (Nafin) for $82 (unaudited). Nafin was the leading ETF in Mexico and was responsible for approximately 20% (unaudited) of the average daily volume on the Mexico Bolsa. The goodwill and identifiable intangibles generated through the purchase of Nafin approximated $56 (unaudited) and $14 (unaudited), respectively. The acquired intangibles include the estimated value of the right option to propose changing the Trustee of the Trust to BGI, allowing the Company to operate the ETF under the iShares brand, and thereby obtain asset management revenue. In addition to the allocation to goodwill and intangibles, the purchase price included $11 of VAT (unaudited). On December 31, 2008, the Company held a deposit of $14 (unaudited), equal to 20% (unaudited) of the purchase price, as guarantee to Nafin, which is recorded in prepaid and other assets in the combined balance sheet.

8. Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued)
 
Intangible assets acquired in the purchase of IndexChange primarily include distribution channels of $39. The distribution channels are considered finite-lived intangibles and are amortized over nine years. Licenses and other were generated through the acquisition of fund manager and sponsorship rights of certain Dublin registered investment funds in 2003.
In accordance with SFAS 144 (ASC 360-10, ), the Company records impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that long-lived assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, and the nine months ended September 30, 2009, there were no indicators of impairment. As of September 30, 2009, the fair value of the assets continues to exceed the carrying value of the assets.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Amortization expense for purchased finite-lived intangible assets was $8, $12 and $18 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively and $4 (unaudited) and $8 (unaudited) for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Barclays Global Investors 401(k) Savings Plan
All salaried employees of the Company that are citizens of the United States are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Savings Plan sponsored by the Company. New employees are eligible to participate in the plan immediately after the hire date. Under the plan, the Company makes certain matching contributions for eligible employees who elect salary and/or bonus reduction contributions and who have completed one year of employment.

Defined Benefit Pension Plan
The Company's UK-based employees participate in the BBPLC defined benefit pension plan, the UK Retirement Fund (UKRF). There are no contractual arrangements between the Company and BBPLC to charge the Company for the net defined benefit cost arising in this plan. The Company recognized pension expense of $17, $12, and $11 in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, and $8 (unaudited) and $13 (unaudited) for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, for contributions made to this plan on behalf of the Company's employees.
Discretionary and Deferred Compensation
The Company offers several discretionary and deferred compensation plans to eligible employees and management personnel. The purpose of the deferred compensation plans is to encourage long-term retention of key employees, allow participants to defer compensation in accordance with IRS regulations, and in some situations to offer market competitive saving opportunities by matching deferred amounts or providing investment returns on amounts deferred. The plans have specific vesting criteria. The accrued liability under these plans at December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $670, $1,167, and $1,005, respectively and $716 (unaudited) at September 30, 2009.
Included in the above is the mandatory compensation deferral plan, the Executive Share Award (ESAS). The ESAS is a BPLC plan in which participants receive a provisional allocation of shares in BPLC. The portion that is allocated to the ESAS will also provide the opportunity to earn 20% "bonus shares" after three years and a further 10% if amounts are voluntarily deferred an additional two years. ESAS awards are also made to eligible employees for recruitment purposes. No provisional allocation of the ESAS awards were made during 2009 or 2008. ESAS compensation expense totaled $7, $33, and $29, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively and $4 (unaudited) and $25 (unaudited) for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and is included in "Compensation and other Personnel Costs" in the combined statements of income and comprehensive income.

As of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the unrecognized compensation cost related to the ESAS plan were $7 (unaudited) and $12, respectively.
Equity Ownership Plan
The BGI Equity Ownership Plan (BGI EOP) was approved by the shareholdings of BBPLC at the 2000 Annual General Meeting in order to provide the employee share incentive arrangements required to recruit and retain the quality of senior management and investment talent appropriate for a leading global investment management business. The BGI EOP was designed to provide participants with long-term equity interest in the Company to meet expectations of, in particular, the Company's employees in the United States, who would ordinarily expect to participate in the equity of their employer. Under the terms of the BGI EOP, options are granted at fair value to key employees of shares in Barclays Global Investors UK Holdings Limited (BGIUKHL) with an overall cap of 20% of the issued ordinary share capital to BGIUKHL. All options are approved by the Board of Directors of BGIUKHL.
In summary, the BGI EOP operates as follows:
 
 
 
 
10. Employee Compensation and Benefits (continued)
 
Once employees become stockholders, they are subject to the Articles of BGIUKHL under which:
 
 
 
Amortization of stock-based compensation of BGI EOP totaled $58, $110 and $69 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively and $16 (unaudited) and $48 (unaudited) for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and is included in "Employee Compensation and Benefits" in the combined statements of income and other comprehensive income.
 
10. Employee Compensation and Benefits (continued)
 
Analysis of the movement in the number and weighted-average exercise price of options are as follows:
 
 
10. Employee Compensation and Benefits (continued)
 
The exercise price range, the weighted-average remaining contractual life, and number of options outstanding (including those exercisable) at December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 are as follows:
 
The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $60, $212, and $259, respectively and $0 (unaudited) and $60 (unaudited) for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
 
10. Employee Compensation and Benefits (continued)
 
Fair value of the options is calculated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model. Significant weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the options granted in 2007 and 2006 are as follows (no options were granted in 2008):
 
Option life is estimated based upon the historical date for the holding period trend. Prior to 2006, expected volatility was determined using the historical volatility of the share price of BGIUKHL. Effective 2006, with the adoption of SFAS 123(R), expected volatility is determined using the historical volatility of BGIUKHL's peers over the expected life of the options for BGI EOP.
As of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the total unrecognized compensation cost were $4 (unaudited) and $27, respectively. The weighted-average remaining vesting period related to the options for BGI EOP that have not yet vested at December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, were one year, one year, and two years, respectively and 0 years at September 30, 2009.
Total fair value of shares vested during the year was $369, $496, and $280 for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively and $258 (unaudited) and $352 (unaudited) for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
No further options are granted under the BGI EOP, and the plan will be terminated at the Transaction close date.
 
11. Income Taxes
The components of the Company's income tax expense (benefit) for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, as follows:
 
 
11. Income Taxes (continued)
 
The reconciliation of the Company's federal statutory tax rate to the effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, is as follows:
 
The combined financial statements do not include a common parent entity above the combined entities that operate in different jurisdictions. As such, the Company has not provided for deferred income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings for any of the combined entities.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for the same items for income tax reporting purposes.
In 2008, the significant differences between the effective tax rate and statutory tax rate relate to an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions and the effect of overseas withholding taxes on the income generated within the separate account assets of BGI Pensions Management Ltd.
 
11. Income Taxes (continued)
 
The components of the Company's net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, are as follows:
 
The Company maintains a valuation allowance of $40, $13, and $13 at December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, against certain of its deferred tax assets, as it is more likely than not that they will not be fully realized. The deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established pertains to Canadian realized capital losses and US unrealized capital losses on investment securities. The expiration period for Canadian realized capital losses is typically indefinite; however, these tax attributes may not be carried over upon a change of control.
The Company adopted the provision of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 did not result in a net change to beginning retained earnings as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle.
 
11. Income Taxes (continued)
 
The following tabular reconciliation presents the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits:
 
As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the balance of the Company's unrecognized tax balances which would, if recognized, affect the Company's effective tax rate was $177 and $97, respectively.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense. Related to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above, the Company accrued interest and penalties of $14 during 2008 and in total, as of December 31, 2008, has recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $61. During 2007, the Company accrued interest and penalties of $1 and in total, as of December 31, 2007, had recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $47.
The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in multiple jurisdictions. The tax years after 2003 remain open to U.S. federal, state, and local income tax examination, and the tax years after 2007 remain open to income tax examination in the United Kingdom.
 
11. Income Taxes (continued)
 
As of December 31, 2008, the Company is not currently under audit for US federal tax purposes. It is reasonably possible that there could be a decrease of approximately $34 in the FIN 48 reserve due to a potential lapse in the statute of federal limitations over the next 12 months. The Company is under audit for California tax purposes, and, until formal resolutions are reached between the Company and California tax authorities, the determination of a possible audit settlement range with respect to the impact of unrecognized tax benefits is not practicable at this point in time. The Company does not anticipate that any possible adjustments resulting from these audits would result in a material change to its consolidated financial statements.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, income tax expense was $713 (unaudited) and $191 (unaudited), respectively. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 was 31% (unaudited) as compared to (857%) (unaudited) for nine months ended September 30, 2008. The primary change in the effective rate was driven by a significant decrease in the FIN 48 reserves of approximately $154 (unaudited) during the period January 1, 2009 to September 30, 2009. The deferred tax asset decreased by approximately $334 (unaudited) during the period January 1, 2009 to September 30, 2009. The majority of this change was caused by a decrease in the deferred tax asset related to unrealized investment losses of approximately $337 (unaudited) that occurred during this period.

13. Commitments and Contingencies (continued)
 
Collateral Under Securities Lending and Derivative Arrangements
The Company facilitates securities lending arrangements whereby securities held by consolidated funds and separate account assets are lent to third parties. In exchange, the Company receives collateral in the form of cash or securities equal to at least 100% of the securities lent plus a margin in order to reduce credit risk. Under certain of the Company's arrangements, in the event the third party does not repay the securities, the Company can resell or re-pledge the collateral. The securities lending transactions entered into by the Company are accompanied by an agreement that entitles and obligates the Company to repurchase or redeem the transferred securities before their maturity. These transactions are not reported as sales under SFAS 140 because of the obligation of the Company to repurchase the securities. Certain of the security lending arrangements entered into by the Company contain the right of the parties to sell or re-pledge the collateral. As a result, the Company records the collateral received under these arrangements (both cash and non-cash), as its own asset in addition to a corresponding liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The Company may also obtain collateral from certain derivative counterparties as a protection against default. As with the securities lending collateral discussed above, the fair value of the asset and related obligation to return the collateral are recorded by the Company. The fair value of the assets recorded under these arrangements was approximately $25,481, $44,532, and $26,570 as of December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively and $22,449 (unaudited) as of September 30, 2009 and is recorded in "Collateral assets under securities lending and derivative agreements" in the combined balance sheets. The fair value of the liability approximates the fair value of the asset and is recorded in the combined balance sheets.
In connection with one client, BGINA has agreed to provide indemnification against a client's loss in the event of a broker default on securities borrowed. Under the terms of the indemnification agreement, the amount of potential liability is limited to the excess of the cost of replacement securities over the amount of the collateral delivered by the borrower. No losses have been incurred and no liabilities have been recognized in connection with this indemnification. At December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, the value of the securities loaned subject to this agreement was approximately $441, $735, and $1,293 and $274 (unaudited) at September 30, 2009. The accounts the Company indemnified are no longer engaged in securities lending and the Company made no payouts on the indemnification as of September 30, 2009.

The Company has agreed to indemnify its clearing broker for losses that the clearing broker may sustain from the customer accounts introduced by the Company. Should a customer not fulfill its obligation on a transaction, the Company may be required to buy or sell securities at prevailing market prices in the future on behalf of its customer. The Company's obligation under the indemnification is limited to unsettled transactions with counterparties. The Company recorded no liability under the indemnification at December 31, 2008, because the risk of loss is remote. In addition, all unsettled trades at December 31, 2008 were settled with no resulting liability to the Company.
The Company is also engaged in various trading and brokerage activities where the counterparties are either institutional clients or broker-dealers. In the event counterparties do not fulfill their obligations, the Company may be exposed to risk. The risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty or issuer of the instrument. It is the Company's policy to review, as necessary, the credit standing of each counterparty with which it conducts business.
Capital Support Agreements
The Company has entered into capital support agreements with certain managed funds that are structured to require payment to the funds under certain circumstances, including (i) a payment default on certain covered securities, (ii) a restructuring with respect to certain covered securities, or (iii) for certain of the agreements realized losses from the disposition of certain covered securities. If any of these circumstances were to occur at a time when the protected fund's market-based valuation is below a certain threshold compared to the fund's net asset value, the Company would be required to make a payment to the fund. Changes in the fair value of these agreements are recognized in current earnings. As discussed in Note 7, for some funds, where the capital support agreements constitute a variable interest and the Company is considered the primary beneficiary of those funds, the funds are included in these combined financial statements.
Purchase Obligations
The Company has entered into contracts with third parties for software maintenance and license fees due in 2009 through 2011. Future minimum payments on these unconditional purchases obligations aggregated to $18, $19, and $13 at December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, and $21 (unaudited) at September 30, 2009.
 
13. Commitments and Contingencies (continued)
 
Under European Law, Article 13B(d)(6) of the Sixth VAT Directive exempts from value added tax (VAT) "the management of special investment funds as defined by Member States." The UK has historically applied this exemption to the management of UK-domiciled authorized unit trusts and OEICs. Therefore, the investment management fees charged by the Company to these funds have been exempt from VAT, while other management fees (e.g., direct fees to pension funds, unauthorized unit trusts, investment trusts, etc.) have been taxable. The recent Advocate General's opinion in the case of JP Morgan Fleming Claverhouse (an investment trust company) has resulted in the possibility that the Company should not charge VAT on its investment management to these clients and that it will have to refund the VAT charged to its clients/funds on investment management fees in the past, although the case is too early in the legal process to state this with any certainty. At this stage, a high level of uncertainty exists over the outcome of the ongoing litigation and the amounts involved and, as such, no liability has been recognized, nor the amount of any potential liability disclosed.
Lease Commitments
The Company leases office space pursuant to long-term lease agreements with third parties. These leases expire at various dates through March 2023 and contain various renewal and expansion options.
Future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases with terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2008, were as follows:
 
 
13. Commitments and Contingencies (continued)
 
Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, was approximately $56, $42, and $26, respectively, and $53 (unaudited) and $44 (unaudited) for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively net of sublease rental income of $1, $3, and $3, respectively and $0.3 (unaudited) and $1 (unaudited) for nine month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
14. Regulatory Capital
The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain $566 (unaudited) and $551 in net capital at these subsidiaries and was in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements.
15. Subsequent Events
On June 12, 2009, the Board of Directors of BPLC announced that it had received an offer from BlackRock to purchase certain legal entities and assets and liabilities of BGI. The offer was approved by shareholders at a general meeting called for the purpose in August 2009. Under the terms of the deal, BPLC will sell the certain legal entities and assets and liabilities of BGI to BlackRock for approximately $13,500, which includes a 19.9% equity interest in the enlarged business. The transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2009 and is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals.
Included in systems development and professional fees on the combined statements of income and other comprehensive income is $7, $7, and $5 of payments made by the Company to BlackRock in 2008, 2007, and 2006, and $6 (unaudited) and $6 (unaudited) for nine month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, for certain portfolio management, analytical and operational services relating to the Company's fixed income businesses. Additionally, the Company held $193, $146, and $0 of cash and cash equivalents in BlackRock funds as of December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively and $450 (unaudited) as of September 30, 2009.
 
15. Subsequent Events (continued)
 
In connection with the transaction, certain of the capital support agreements referred to in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, were extended to 2013. Also, new support agreements were put in place to protect against loss on certain covered assets in the funds with a maximum obligation that increases over time so that total coverage under all of the support agreements is approximately $2,200. In addition, in connection with the transaction, certain employee compensation plans, including EOP will either accelerate or terminate. As a result, the Company is expected to settle its obligations to employees. During November 2009, the Company settled its capital support reimbursement liability to BBPLC by paying $474 (unaudited) to BBPLC. As of the date of the settlement, the carrying value of the Company's obligation to reimburse BBPLC was $1,163 (unaudited). The Company no longer has any obligation to reimburse BBPLC for losses on the covered assets.
In June 2009, certain assets in Barclays California were sold to BGI Finance Limited in the amount of $299. The transaction was settled in cash.
During February 2009, the Board of Directors of Barclays Global Investors Canada Limited (BGICL), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, declared and paid a dividend of $40, to Barclay Global Investors Holdings Canada Limited (BGIHCL). During November 2009, BGICL declared and paid a dividend of $30 (unaudited) and paid a permanent return of capital of $33 (unaudited) to BGIHCL.
During February 2009, the Board of Directors of BGIHCL declared and paid a dividend of $40, to BGIUKHL. During November 2009, BGIHCL declared and paid a dividend of $60 (unaudited) to BGIUKHL.
During March 2009, Barclays Global Investors Pension Management Ltd. and Barclays Global Investors Australia Limited declared and paid dividends of $21 and $45, respectively, to BGIUKHL. During November 2009, dividends of $46 (unaudited) and $17 (unaudited), respectively were declared and paid to BGIUKHL.
During November 2009, Barclay Global Investors Ireland declared and paid dividends of $86 (unaudited) to BGIUKHL.
During January 2009, BGICL launched a restructuring initiative that involved a broad-based review of its operating business model. The initiative is expected to be completed in 2009. No amounts related to this initiative were recorded in 2008.
 

Exhibit 99.2
On December 1, 2009, BlackRock, Inc. ("BlackRock") acquired from Barclays Bank PLC ("Barclays") all of the outstanding equity interests of subsidiaries of Barclays conducting the business Barclays Global Investors ("BGI") in exchange for capital shares valued at $8.53 billion and $6.65 billion in cash, both of which are subject to certain adjustments.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income and explanatory notes of BlackRock set forth below for the year ended December 31, 2008 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 give effect to the acquisition of BGI accounted for as a purchase business combination, as if the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2008.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of financial condition at September 30, 2009 set forth below gives effect to the acquisition of BGI assuming the transaction was consummated at September 30, 2009.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income are provided for informational purposes only and do not purport to reflect the results of BlackRock's operations had the transaction actually been consummated on January 1, 2008. We have made, in our opinion, all adjustments that are necessary to present fairly the pro forma financial data. The pro forma combined provision for income taxes may not represent the amounts that would have resulted had BlackRock and BGI filed consolidated income tax returns during the periods presented.
The purchase accounting adjustments within these pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions and therefore are subject to revision. Final balances delivered at the December 1, 2009 closing may be significantly different than the September 30, 2009 balances used solely for the purposes of developing this pro forma information. In addition, as management receives additional information its analysis of the fair value measurements of certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities could be materially different.

BlackRock acquired from Barclays Bank PLC ("Barclays") all of the outstanding equity interests of subsidiaries of Barclays conducting the business of Barclays Global Investors ("BGI") in exchange for an aggregate of 37,566,771 shares of BlackRock common stock and participating preferred stock, subject to certain adjustments, and $6.65 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments (the "BGI Transaction"). The fair value of the 37,566,771 shares at closing, on December 1, 2009, was $8.53 billion, at a price of $227.08 per share, the closing price of BlackRock's common stock on November 30, 2009.
The acquisition of BGI brings together market leaders in active and index strategies to create the preeminent asset management firm which will manage approximately $3.2 trillion on behalf of institutional and retail investors worldwide. The combined firm's products will include equities, fixed income, cash management, and alternatives and will offer clients diversified access to global markets through separate accounts, common trust funds, mutual funds, ETFs, hedge funds, and closed-end funds. The following tables present the mix of BlackRock's combined assets under management as of September 30, 2009 by asset class and management style and the mix by client type.
 
All asset class and client type designations are subject to further review and reclassification.
The shares of common stock issued to Barclays pursuant to the BGI Transaction represented approximately 4.8% of the outstanding shares of common stock of BlackRock immediately following the closing of the transaction, and the total equity consideration represented approximately an aggregate 19.8% economic interest in BlackRock immediately following the closing of the transaction. Barclays generally is restricted from purchasing additional shares of BlackRock common or preferred stock if it would result in Barclays holding more than 4.9% of the total voting power of BlackRock or more than 19.9% of the total capital stock of BlackRock on a fully diluted basis. In addition, Barclays is restricted from transferring 100% of its BlackRock capital stock for one year after closing and 50% of its BlackRock capital stock for the next subsequent year, without the prior written consent of BlackRock.
The cash portion of the purchase price was funded through a combination of existing cash, issuance of short term debt and proceeds from the issuance of 19,914,652 capital shares, at a price of $140.60, to a group of institutional investors, including The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. ("PNC").
The BGI Transaction was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 805, . Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of the transaction. The excess, if any, of the final purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recorded as goodwill.
Business Combinations
 
 
 
A summary of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in this acquisition is as follows:
 
Finite-life management contracts have a weighted-average estimated useful life of approximately 12 years and will be amortized on the straight-line method.
The purchase accounting adjustments within these pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions and therefore are subject to revisions. Final BGI balances, including the cash and cash equivalents, investments and due to related parties balances, delivered at closing may be significantly different than the September 30, 2009 balances used solely for the purposes of developing this pro forma information. In addition, as management receives further information its analysis of the fair value measurements of the following acquired assets and assumed liabilities could be materially different:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of financial condition at September 30, 2009 is based on the historical unaudited condensed consolidated statement of financial condition of BlackRock, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on Form 10-Q on November 6, 2009, and the condensed combined balance sheet of BGI as included in this Form 8-K/A. The pro forma statement of financial condition has been prepared as if the BGI Transaction had occurred on September 30, 2009, the date of the statement of financial condition.
BlackRock's pro forma condensed statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was derived from the Company's consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2008, and the combined statement of income and other comprehensive income for BGI for the year ended December 31, 2008. BlackRock's unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma statement of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 was derived from the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, which were filed with the SEC on Form 10-Q, and the unaudited condensed combined statement of income and other comprehensive income for BGI for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. The pro forma condensed combined statements of income have been prepared as if the BGI Transaction occurred on January 1, 2008.
These unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained within BlackRock's Form 10-Q, referenced above, and BlackRock's Form 8-K (an update to the financial information in BlackRock's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008) as filed with the SEC on September 17, 2009 as well as BGI's audited annual combined financial statements, prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, for the year ended December 31, 2008 and unaudited condensed combined interim financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 included in this Form 8-K/A.
All significant accounts and transactions between BGI and BlackRock have been eliminated from the combined financial statements.
 
 
 
The following additional assumptions were made in deriving BlackRock's pro forma condensed combined financial statements:
 
 
 
 
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not purport to be indicative of the actual financial position or results of BlackRock's operations, or of BlackRock's future financial position or results of operations, had BlackRock's acquisition of BGI on December 1, 2009 actually been consummated on January 1, 2008. The pro forma adjustments reflecting the allocation of the purchase price of BGI on the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of financial condition and the effect thereof on pro forma adjustments to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income are based on preliminary estimates and are subject to finalization. The pro forma combined provision for income taxes may not represent the amounts that would have resulted had BlackRock and BGI filed consolidated income tax returns during the periods presented.
 
 
The pro forma combined basic and diluted earnings per share for the periods presented are based on the pro forma weighted-average number of shares of common stock of BlackRock during each applicable period.
Due to the similarities in terms between BlackRock series A, B, C and D non-voting participating preferred stock and the Company's common stock, the Company considers each series of the non-voting participating preferred stock to be common stock equivalents for purposes of earnings per share calculations. As such, the Company has included the non-voting participating preferred stock in the calculation of average basic and diluted shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2008 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2009.
The following tables present the computations of pro forma basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2009, respectively:
 
 
 
 
 
 
The pro forma condensed combined statement of financial condition has been prepared to reflect the acquisition of BGI for the aggregate consideration described in Note 1 (Barclays Global Investors Transaction) as if the transaction has been completed on September 30, 2009. Pro forma adjustments have been made:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The pro forma condensed combined statements of income have been prepared as if the transaction and financing had been completed on January 1, 2008. Pro forma adjustments have been made:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The BGI statements of income and other comprehensive income included the following:
 
 
 
These expenses are not included as a pro forma adjustment as they are not directly attributable to the transaction.
Subsequent to the close of the transaction, BlackRock will incur additional transaction/integration costs over a period of up to one year as well as additional stock-based compensation related to grants of new awards, which may be material.
