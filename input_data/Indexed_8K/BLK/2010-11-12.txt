Underwriting Agreement
On November 8, 2010, BlackRock, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") by and among the Company, Merrill Lynch Group, Inc. ("Merrill Lynch"), PNC Bancorp, Inc. ("PNC Bancorp") and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPFS") and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated ("MS&Co."), as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), pursuant to which Merrill Lynch, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank of America and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., and PNC Bancorp, a wholly-owned subsidiary of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. ("PNC"), agreed to sell to the Underwriters 56,283,134 shares of common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), including 45,395,052 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Company's Series B Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Series B Preferred Stock") and including 5,207,376 shares of Common Stock exercisable under the Underwriters' overallotment option (which was exercised in full on November 9, 2010), for resale by the Underwriters (the "Secondary Offering") pursuant to the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-169328) (the "Registration Statement"). The Company will not receive any of proceeds from the sale of Common Stock in the Secondary Offering.
The Company and the selling stockholders have agreed to indemnify the Underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the Underwriters may be required to make because of any of those liabilities.
At September 30, 2010, Merrill Lynch and PNC Bancorp and its affiliates owned approximately 3.7% and 34.7%, respectively, of the Company's Common Stock outstanding and held approximately 33.9% and 24.3%, respectively, of the Company's capital stock. Following the Secondary Offering, the PNC Exchange (as defined below) and the Direct Placement (as defined below), Merrill Lynch and PNC Bancorp and its affiliates will own 0% and 25.3%, respectively, of the Company's Common Stock outstanding and will hold 7.1% and 20.3%, respectively, of the Company's capital stock. Additionally, affiliates of Merrill Lynch and PNC Bancorp are acting as underwriters in the Secondary Offering. Further, affiliates of other underwriters in the Secondary Offering own our capital stock.
The Underwriters and their affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking, commercial lending, financial advisory and other services for us. They have received customary fees and expenses for these services. In particular, affiliates of some of the Underwriters are dealers under our $3.0 billion commercial paper program. In addition, affiliates of some of the Underwriters are lenders and/or documentation agents under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility maturing in 2012.
The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Underwriting Agreement, a copy of which is attached as an exhibit to this current report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
Placement Agent Agreement
On November 8, 2010, the Company entered into a placement agent agreement (the "Placement Agent Agreement") by and among the Company, Merrill Lynch, MLPFS and MS&Co., as placement agents (the "Placement Agents"), pursuant to which Merrill Lynch has agreed to sell 2,453,988 shares of Common Stock (consisting solely of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Series B Preferred Stock) to an institutional investor, subject to completion of the Secondary Offering (the "Direct Placement"). The Placement Agents used their commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from the institutional investor an offer to purchase approximately $400 million of Common Stock and do not have any obligations to buy any shares of Common Stock from Merrill Lynch nor are the Placement Agents required to arrange the purchase or sale of any shares of Common Stock. No fee will be paid to the Placement Agents for acting as such in the Direct Placement. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the Direct Placement. The Direct Placement will be made pursuant to a prospectus supplement to the Company's prospectus, dated September 13, 2010, filed as part of the Company's Registration Statement. Closing of the Direct Placement is conditioned upon the concurrent closing of the Secondary Offering.
 
The Company and Merrill Lynch have agreed to indemnify the Placement Agents against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the Placement Agents may be required to make because of any of those liabilities.
As described above, the Placement Agents and their affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking, commercial lending, financial advisory and other services for us.
The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Placement Agent Agreement, a copy of which is attached as an exhibit to this current report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
Exchange Agreement
On November 8, 2010, the Company entered into an exchange agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") by and among the Company, PNC Bancorp and PNC, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue, concurrently with the closing of the Secondary Offering, 11,105,000 shares of Common Stock to PNC Bancorp in exchange for an equal number of shares of our Series B Preferred Stock (the "PNC Exchange") in a private exchange for which no commission or other remuneration has been paid or given for soliciting such exchange in accordance with section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act. This issuance will allow PNC to retain a greater than 25% voting interest in the Company following the Secondary Offering and the Direct Placement.
The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Exchange Agreement, a copy of which is attached as an exhibit to this current report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company, the Selling Shareholders and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Selling Shareholders on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company and the Selling Shareholders shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by them, respectively, and benefits

The Company, the Selling Shareholders and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

Default by an Underwriter or a Selling Shareholder
(a) If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the number of shares of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule A hereto bears to the number of shares of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , that in the event that the number of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the total number of Securities set forth in Schedule A hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter, any Selling Shareholder or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9(a), the Closing Date or Date of Delivery, as the case may be, shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the
provided, however

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company, any Selling Shareholder and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
(b) If any one or more Selling Shareholders shall fail to sell and deliver or cause to be delivered any of the Securities agreed to be sold and delivered or caused to be delivered by such Selling Shareholder hereunder and such failure to sell and deliver or cause to be delivered shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, and the remaining Selling Shareholders do not exercise the right hereby granted to increase, pro rata or otherwise, the number of Securities to be sold by them hereunder to the total number to be sold by all Selling Shareholders as set forth in Schedule B hereto, then the Underwriters may, at the option of the Representatives, by notice from the Representatives to the Company and the non-defaulting Selling Shareholders, either (i) terminate this Agreement without any liability on the fault of any non-defaulting party except that the provisions of Sections 7 and 8 shall remain in full force and effect or (ii) elect to purchase the Securities which the non-defaulting Selling Shareholders have agreed to sell hereunder. In the event of a default by any Selling Shareholder as set forth in this Section 9(b), the Closing Date or Date of Delivery, as the case may be, shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.

This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have.
provided, however

Benefits received by the Company and the Selling Shareholder shall be deemed to be equal to the total proceeds from the direct placement (before deducting expenses) received by the Selling Shareholder, and benefits received by the Placement Agents shall be deemed to be equal to the Deemed Amount.
