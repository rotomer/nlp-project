If any Covered Product, other than any Covered Product that falls within a category, type or platform to which the Current Terms apply in accordance with Section 4(a)(i), becomes part of a group or program of similar products distributed by the Merrill Lynch Distributors, some of which Products are sponsored by managers other than BlackRock, the economic terms offered by the Merrill Lynch Distributor to BlackRock for the Distribution of such Covered Product shall be at least as favorable to BlackRock and the Covered Product as the most favorable economic terms to which any of such Products is entitled. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this clause (ii), (A) no Merrill Lynch Distributor shall be required to extend to a Covered Product, and BlackRock shall not be required to extend to the Merrill Lynch Distributors, the most favorable economic terms that the Merrill Lynch Distributors or BlackRock, respectively, may provide to managers or Distributors, as the case may be, with respect to a Product that a Merrill Lynch Distributor or BlackRock, as the case may be, reasonably determines represents a unique or substantially differentiated opportunity relative to the relevant Covered Product or the Distribution, respectively, offered by BlackRock or Merrill Lynch; , , that the foregoing exception shall not apply to the terms Merrill Lynch may provide to any Product managed by a Merrill Lynch Alternative Manager that could reasonably be considered to be a competing product; and (B) no Product managed by a Merrill Lynch Alternative Manager that could reasonably be considered to be a competing product may be offered through any platform of Merrill Lynch's Global Private Client business (as renamed or restructured from time to time) prior to completion of twelve months after the later of (i) the date such

Product is first bona fide offered to unaffiliated investors and (ii) the date Merrill Lynch acquires such Merrill Lynch Alternative Manager unless such Product was offered through any Global Private Client platform prior to the time Merrill Lynch commenced discussions regarding such acquisition and no such Product offered through any Global Private Client platform may directly or indirectly utilize the name Merrill Lynch or any derivative thereof in connection with any such offering.
(iii) With respect to any Merrill Lynch Distributor that does not at the time in question Distribute a particular Covered Product, Merrill Lynch will, upon the request of BlackRock, use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Distribution of any Covered Products by such Merrill Lynch Distributor as so requested by BlackRock on the same terms as provided above in Section 4(a)(i) and (ii), subject to Requirements of Law and the Applicable Standards and Practices of the applicable Merrill Lynch Distributor.
(iv) Subject to Requirements of Law and to Applicable Standards and Practices and excepting the Yield Support Agreement, the economic terms attaching to each Covered Product as referred to in Section 4(a)(i) shall remain in effect until the end of the initial term set forth in Section 12(a) (the "").

In the event that Requirements of Law or Applicable Standards and Policies require any modification to the economic terms with respect to Covered Products to which the Current Terms apply in accordance with Section 4(a)(i), such modifications shall be made so as to result in the minimum necessary deviation from the Current Terms.
(vi) The Parties will conduct themselves so that any changes to the economic terms of any Covered Product (excepting the Yield Support Agreement) required to be made by Section 4(a) (other than on account of changes in Requirements of Law) will be balanced by other changes, opportunities, products, strategies, initiatives or arrangements that the Parties agree will be economically neutral across the Covered Products and only effected consistently with Section 4(h) below.
(b) Merrill Lynch will not, and will cause each Merrill Lynch Distributor not to, provide to its Sales Force for the sale of Products that are not Covered Products and that would generally be viewed as competitive with the applicable Covered Products (including, to
 
the extent relevant, product type and/or class and asset class and style) in the channel in question any compensation or economic inducement or benefit that is greater than that provided to such Sales Force for the sale of such Covered Products in such channel, , that this provision is not intended to prohibit a Merrill Lynch Distributor from selling Products that provide for different rates of sales load, placementRule 12b-1, trailing commissions or other related fees (., Class A shares for different Products or funds that have different sales compensation structures). For the avoidance of doubt, as an example of the foregoing, the Parties agree that any more favorable compensation or economic inducement or benefit shall not have occurred if a Covered Product and such competitive Product that have the same pricing structure, and members of such Sales Force are entitled to varying dollar amounts of compensation as a result of the application of such pricing structure's breakpoints to different purchase amounts or the application of different payout ratios among the members of such Sales Force in accordance with the predetermined formula for payout ratio to the sales resulting from such purchase amounts.

(c) (i) Subject to Requirements of Law and Applicable Standards and Practices and excepting the Yield Support Agreement, during the term of this Agreement, Merrill Lynch expects to maintain its current arrangements with respect to the existing money market funds sponsored or managed by MLIM (which funds are identified on Schedule 4(c) hereto).
(ii) In addition, Merrill Lynch will not implement or execute a business program that is intentionally designed to cause multiple Merrill Lynch customers holding such MLIM money market fund shares to redeem such shares for transfers to bank deposit products of the Merrill Lynch banks.
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, in case of a direct or indirect acquisition by Merrill Lynch of the assets or business of another entity engaged in the Distribution of Products whether or not competitive with the applicable Covered Products in the channel in question, (i) no such acquisition will limit or restrict any obligation of any Merrill Lynch Distributor to Distribute Covered Products pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any Selling Agreement, as applicable, and (ii) at the request of BlackRock, Merrill Lynch shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause such newly acquired Merrill Lynch Distributor to Distribute Covered Products on the same basis as set forth in Section 4(a), subject to Requirements of Law, Applicable Standards and Practices and any contractual provisions such acquired business is subject to immediately prior to the execution of the related acquisition agreement ( that such contractual provision was not entered into in connection with, as a part of or in preparation for, such acquisition).

Such change may only be made subject to the terms of Section 4(h) below.

Buyback Resolution
(v) If an agreement is not reached within 30 days pursuant to Section 4(h)(ii), then corporate officers along with the appropriate business heads or their delegates of each of BlackRock and Merrill Lynch shall negotiate in good faith to reach an agreement within an additional 30 days on the Impact Estimate and the Offset Resolution or Buyback Resolution.

In the event an agreement is not reached on an Offset Resolution within 10 Business Days of the determination of the Impact Estimate, the Parties shall implement the Buyback Resolution and shall not implement an Offset Resolution.
(viii) If the Parties reach an agreement on the Impact Estimate, but are unable to reach an agreement on an Offset Resolution pursuant to Section 4(h)(vi), the Parties shall implement the Buyback Resolution within 10 Business Days and shall not implement an Offset Resolution.
(ix) In the event that the Offset Resolution is determined in accordance with paragraphs 4(h)(i)-(vi) exclusively (and not in accordance with Paragraphs 4(h)(iv), (vii) and (viii)), at the request of either Party, during the term of this Agreement, at quarterly intervals first beginning six months after the implementation of an Offset Resolution, one or more of the officers of each Party as listed on Exhibit C (as Exhibit C may be supplemented or changed by such Party from time to time) will meet to evaluate the adverse revenue impact to BlackRock of such Section 4 Change and the actual and then-estimated benefits of any Offset Resolution. In the event that the actual and then-estimated adverse revenue impact to Blackrock is material, the Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to identify, and Merrill Lynch will implement (or modify), additional changes, opportunities, products, strategies, initiatives and arrangements permitted by Requirements of law and Applicable Standards and Practices to the extent necessary to offset, in all material respects, such adverse revenue impact to BlackRock.
