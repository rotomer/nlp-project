The facility includes an accordion feature, which would allow us to increase, from time to time, with willing lenders, the overall size of the facility, with the aggregate amount of commitment increases pursuant to this feature not to exceed $1.0 billion.  The facility also allows for alternative currency loans, and permits BlackRock to designate certain wholly-owned subsidiaries as designated borrowers with the ability to receive loans and have letters of credit issued under the facility.  We may borrow amounts, and repay amounts, under the facility from time to time.
BlackRocks obligations under the facility are unsecured and are not guaranteed by any of its subsidiaries.  All obligations of any subsidiary borrower under the facility are guaranteed by BlackRock.  The facility matures on March 10, 2016.  The facility contains various conditions to borrowing, and affirmative, negative and financial maintenance covenants.
The facility also contains various standard events of default, the occurrence of which could result in a termination by the lenders and the acceleration of all of BlackRocks and its subsidiary borrowers obligations under the facility.
The foregoing description of the terms and conditions of the 2011 Credit Facility is not complete and is in all respects subject to the actual provisions of the 2011 Credit Facility, a copy of which has been filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and which is incorporated by reference herein.
