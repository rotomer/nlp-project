, for first quarter 2011 was 39.1%. In addition, we have issued a notice of redemption for the remaining approximately $60 million of outstanding convertible debentures.
"I am very pleased with our year-over-year growth in revenues and adjusted EPS, driven by strong investment performance, robust new business in long-term products, increased demand for , and continued expense discipline," commented Laurence D. Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock. "Our new business results, including $82.4 billion in the pipeline, are a direct result of the differentiated value we are delivering for our clients."

Assets under management ("AUM") totaled $3.648 trillion at March 31, 2011, up $87.5 billion or 2% during the quarter. Growth in AUM was driven by a $100.0 billion improvement in market and investment performance and $34.7 billion of net new business in long-term products (equity, fixed income, multi-asset class and alternative investments), which reflected net inflows in all asset classes, client regions and distribution channels.
The table below presents AUM and a comparison of GAAP and as adjusted results for certain financial measures. See Attachment I for a reconciliation of GAAP to the as adjusted financial measures.
 
 
Net new business in long-term products was partially offset by $24.4 billion of net outflows in cash management and $4.5 billion of distributions from advisory accounts. added 12 net new assignments during the quarter. Merger-related outflows slowed to $18.4 billion during the quarter, with a previously reported $9.4 billion remaining in the pipeline. As of April 14, 2011, our net new business pipeline totaled $82.4 billion, including $60.7 billion in long-term products (55% index, 45% active), $6.2 billion in cash management and $15.5 billion in advisory portfolios

.
"In a quarter marked by greater economic and political uncertainty, investors sought more advice about long-term investment themes," added Mr. Fink. "Our global platform and interaction with clients worldwide enriches our perspective and enables more dynamic conversations. Clients are re-risking their portfolios, and we are both contributing to their thought process and serving them with a greater variety of value-added offerings. For example, year-to-date net inflows and wins in alternative investments are approximately $2.0 billion across a wide variety of strategies. These results reflect continued barbelling by clients, and the use of BlackRock's strong alpha products to complement institutional index and offerings.

"The appetite for broader investment solutions is further reflected in our multi-asset class AUM, which grew $22.4 billion this quarter, led by net new business of $6.8 billion in fiduciary assignments. In addition, we attracted net inflows of $16.8 billion in defined contribution AUM, where we offer outcome-oriented solutions such as our portfolios. also posted another strong quarter and continues to expand globally as institutions seek our advice on complex balance sheet issues. In contrast, we continued to see outflows in lower fee cash management offerings and selected institutional index accounts.

BlackRock Solutions
"We have come together as one firm, driving connectivity to tap into the unique strengths of our global organization and reinvesting for future growth. Already this year, we selectively added and enhanced capabilities in areas as diverse as alternatives (renewable power, real estate), the U.S. institutional client group, multi-asset class solutions, and the recently launched BlackRock Investment Institute. The stability of our employee base and the quality of new hires attests to the attractiveness of our platform for the best talent in our industry.
"The strength of our earnings and free cash flow provided us with sufficient resources to continue to reinvest in our business, while further enhancing our payout to shareholders. During the first quarter, we increased our dividend by 38%, and we expect to increase share buybacks during the year consistent with maintaining the increased float in our stock. We have also taken steps to better serve our shareholders by building out our Investor Relations function with senior, experienced professionals.
"Just after quarter-end, BlackRock was added to the S&P 500 Index, which is a testament to the quality of the franchise we have built. We could not have achieved this milestone without the unwavering commitment to excellence of BlackRock's 9,000-plus employees around the world. I thank them all for constantly striving to raise the bar in an effort to continuously earn the trust and respect of our clients."
 
First Quarter Business Highlights
Net new business figures for the quarter are reported before giving effect to merger-related outflows, which decreased 53% to $18.4 billion during the quarter. Lower fee index AUM continued to dominate merger-related outflows including $10.8 billion during the first quarter. Scientific active equity ("SAE") represented the remaining $6.4 billion of outflows, which was the lowest quarterly level since the closing of the Barclays Global Investors ("BGI") transaction. An additional $9.4 billion of previously reported merger-related outflows are reflected in the pipeline and will be realized in due course.
Net new business during the quarter totaled $10.5 billion, reflecting $8.3 billion of net inflows in index, including $7.2 billion of and $2.2 billion in fundamental active portfolios. Fundamental active equity performance was mixed, with 59%, 58% and 77% of AUM performing above the benchmark or peer median for the one-, three-, and five-year periods ended March 31, 2011. Performance in SAE products continued to strengthen, with 62%, 39% and 42% of AUM above benchmark or peer median for the one-, three- and five-year periods ended March 31, 2011.

Equity AUM increased $69.1 billion from year-end to $1.764 trillion
iShares,
Net new business of $8.5 billion reflected $11.2 billion of net inflows in index products, including $8.9 billion in institutional accounts and $2.3 billion in . These results were partially offset by $2.7 billion of outflows in active products, as inflows in local currency, targeted duration and sector-specific strategies were insufficient to overcome outflows in core and global bond mandates. Performance continued to improve, with 70%, 60% and 47% of active taxable fixed income AUM above the benchmark or peer median for the one-, three-, and five-year periods ended March 31, 2011.
.
Fixed income AUM rose $16.9 billion to $1.158 trillion at quarter-end
iShares
. Net new business of $14.9 billion was driven by strength in our institutional channel, which posted $12.4 billion of net inflows, while retail and high net worth clients added $2.5 billion. Results showed particular strength in fiduciary, target-date funds and global allocation products, which led the quarter with net inflows of $6.8 billion, $4.9 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. Performance was strong, with 74%, 76%, and 85% of AUM above the benchmark or peer median for the one-, three-, and five-year periods ended March 31, 2011.
Multi-asset AUM increased 12% during the quarter to $208.0 billion
Net new business of $0.8 billion reflected $2.0 billion of net inflows in single- and multi-strategy hedge funds and real estate, partially offset by net outflows of $1.2 billion primarily in currency overlays. EMEA and the Americas drove the increase despite retraction in Asia. International retail and our commodity products continued to attract assets. Investment performance remained strong across much of the platform and several new products were launched in the range in EMEA.

Alternative investments reached $115.3 billion at quarter end

BlackRock Strategic Funds
Cash management experienced net withdrawals of $24.4 billion largely reflecting institutional reaction to the continued low rate environment with particular pressure related to concerns around European sovereigns and their respective banks. Modest inflows in Asia were more than offset by net outflows of $23.1 billion in the Americas and $1.3 billion in EMEA. We anticipate continued pressure as rates are expected to remain low for the next several quarters.
.
Cash management products continued to face challenging overall market conditions
. Clients in the Americas, EMEA, and Asia-Pacific contributed $30.8 billion, $3.5 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively, in long-term products.These flows reflected a common focus of investors globally on finding attractive returns through higher yielding investments. While flows in the Americas and Asia-Pacific were dominated by renewed interest in equities, growth in EMEA was driven by multi-asset class and fixed income products.
Net new business was positive in all client regions
. Institutional clients awarded us $13.5 billion of net new business in long-term products, predominantly in multi-asset class fiduciary and target date mandates. Retail and high net worth clients contributed $10.7 billion in net inflows, including $5.8 billion in net equity inflows into global sector funds such as the newly launched BlackRock Resources and Commodities Strategy Trust closed-end fund, which raised approximately $1.0 billion.
Clients across all channels demonstrated appetite for re-risking
 
. Net new business of $10.5 billion was driven by $7.2 billion in equities, $2.3 billion in fixed income and $0.9 billion in alternatives. In response to geopolitical unrest in the Middle East, investors retreated from emerging markets into developed market equities and fixed income ETFs. In addition, investors flocked to MSCI Japan, which attracted net inflows of $3.0 billion during the quarter. We continued to expand our product range, with a number of new offerings in fixed income, emerging and frontier markets, and commodities, and we remain intensely focused on ensuring that we deliver the investment performance and liquidity that investors expect.

We also completed 12 short-term advisory assignments during the quarter. In addition, we have six and four risk management implementations in process. Advisory AUM ended the quarter at $146.7 billion, down slightly due to $4.5 billion of net client distributions. Several of our financial markets advisory assignments were featured prominently in the press this quarter, including the valuation work we performed for the Central Bank of Ireland and the bid list process we are conducting for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with respect to the Maiden Lane II portfolio.

As of April 14, 2011, the pipeline consisted of $82.4 billion of AUM funded since quarter-end and net wins to be funded, net of $9.4 billion of previously reported merger-related outflows still pending. Of the total, $60.7 billion was in long-term products, including $33.2 billion in index products and $27.5 billion in a variety of active strategies. In addition, the pipeline of new assignments and pending proposals is extremely strong, reflecting continued de-leveraging in the global banking system, demand for balance sheet surveillance, and extension of our platform for equities.

Excluding BGI integration costs of $52 million in first quarter 2010, first quarter 2011 total operating expenses increased by $195 million compared to $1,289 million. The $195 million increase was primarily due to the following:
 
 
 
 
Non-operating income (expense):
First quarter 2011 non-operating income, net of non-controlling interests, was $19 million compared to non-operating expense, net of non-controlling interests, of $3 million in first quarter 2010. The $19 million non-operating income, net of non-controlling interests, was comprised of $43 million of net gains primarily on co-investments and $5 million of positive marks related to hedges of deferred compensation, partially offset by $29 million of net interest expense. The $43 million net gain on investments included net gains in distressed credit/mortgage funds of $27 million, private equity investments of $8 million, hedge funds/funds of hedge funds of $4 million, real estate equity/debt products of $1 million and other investments of $3 million. Net interest expense of $29 million for the first quarter 2011 decreased by $7 million primarily related to higher interest and dividend income.
Income tax expense:
Income tax expense was $249 million and $228 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The GAAP effective income tax rate for the first quarter 2011 was 30.5%, as compared to 35.0% for the first quarter 2010. The first quarter 2011 GAAP tax rate included a $24 million benefit related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax positions partially offset by a $3 million increase due to enacted state tax legislation.
Operating income:
First quarter 2011 operating income decreased 15% to $798 million from $940 million in fourth quarter 2010.
First quarter 2011 revenues of $2,282 million decreased $211 million, or 8%, compared to $2,493 million in fourth quarter 2010, primarily due to the following:
 
 
 
First quarter 2011 total operating expenses of $1,484 million decreased 4%, or $69 million, compared to $1,553 million in fourth quarter 2010. The $69 million decrease compared to fourth quarter 2010 primarily was due to the following:
 
 
 
Non-operating income (expense):
First quarter 2011 non-operating income, net of non-controlling interests, was $19 million, compared to $26 million in fourth quarter 2010. Non-operating income included $43 million of net positive marks on balance sheet co-investments and $5 million of positive marks related to hedges of deferred compensation, partially offset by $29 million of net interest expense. The $7 million decrease in non-operating income is related to lower gains on investments and an increase in net interest expense.
Income tax expense:
The GAAP effective income tax rate for the first quarter 2011 was 30.5%, as compared to 32.0% for the fourth quarter 2010. The first quarter 2011 GAAP tax rate included a $24 million benefit related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax positions partially offset by a $3 million increase due to enacted state tax legislation. The fourth quarter 2010 GAAP and as adjusted tax rates included the effect of U.S. tax legislation that was enacted during the period to extend certain international tax provisions, which resulted in a tax benefit in fourth quarter 2010.

Attachment I
 
*  Not applicable or the percentage is in excess of +/- 1,000%.
 
BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"); however, management believes that evaluating the Company's ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRock's financial performance over time. BlackRock's management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Certain prior period non-GAAP data has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Computations for all periods are derived from the Company's condensed consolidated statements of income as follows:
(a) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted:
Operating income, as adjusted, equals operating income, GAAP basis, excluding certain items deemed non-recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock's book value, as indicated in the table below. Operating income used for operating margin measurement equals operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income used for operating margin measurement, divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below.
 
 
(a) (continued)
Management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock's financial performance over time. As such, management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, provide useful disclosure to investors.
Operating income, as adjusted:
BGI integration costs recorded in 2010 consist principally of compensation expense, legal fees, marketing and promotional, occupancy and consulting expenses incurred in conjunction with the BGI Transaction. The expenses associated with BGI integration costs have been deemed non-recurring by management and have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, to help enhance the comparability of this information to the current reporting periods. As such, management believes that operating margins exclusive of these costs are useful measures in evaluating BlackRock's operating performance for the respective periods.
The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans ("LTIP") that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. ("PNC") and a Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. ("Merrill Lynch") cash compensation contribution, a portion of which has been received, have been excluded because these charges ultimately do not impact BlackRock's book value.
Compensation expense associated with appreciation/(depreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in non-operating income (expense).
Operating margin, as adjusted:
Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions. Management believes that excluding such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock's results until future periods.
Operating margin, as adjusted, allows BlackRock to compare performance from period-to-period by adjusting for items that may not recur, recur infrequently or may fluctuate based on market movements, such as integration costs, closed-end fund launch costs, commissions paid to certain employees as compensation and fluctuations in compensation expense based on mark-to-market movements in investments held to fund certain compensation plans. BlackRock also uses operating margin, as adjusted, to monitor corporate performance and efficiency and as a benchmark to compare its performance to other companies. Management uses both the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the financial performance of BlackRock. The non-GAAP measure by itself may pose limitations because it does not include all of BlackRock's revenues and expenses.
Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties. Management believes that excluding such costs is useful to BlackRock because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted for under GAAP on a net basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. For each of these items, BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenues.
 
(b) Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, as adjusted:
Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests ("NCI"), as adjusted, equals non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis, less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, GAAP basis, adjusted for compensation expense associated with (appreciation)/depreciation on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans. The compensation expense offset is reported in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis.
 
 
Management believes that non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides for comparability of this information to prior periods and is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock's non-operating contribution to its results. As compensation expense associated with (appreciation)/depreciation on investments related to certain deferred compensation plans, which is included in operating income, offsets the gain/(loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management believes that non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and investors, of BlackRock's non-operating results that impact book value.
 
 
(c) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted:
Management believes that net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock's profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant non-recurring items as well as charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock's book value or benefits that do not impact cash flow.
 
The BGI integration costs reflected in GAAP net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc. have been deemed non-recurring by management and have been excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, to help enhance the comparability of this information to current reporting periods.
The portion of the compensation expense associated with certain LTIP awards that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and a Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution, a portion of which has been received, has been excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, because these charges ultimately do not impact BlackRock's book value.
During first quarter 2011, certain state income tax laws changed due to enacted legislation, which resulted in the re-measurement of certain net deferred income tax liabilities, primarily related to acquired intangible assets. The resulting increase in income taxes has been excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, as this enacted tax legislation change will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability of this information to current reporting periods.
(d) For the quarters ended March 31, 2011, March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2010, non-GAAP adjustments were tax effected at 33%, 35% and 32%, respectively, which reflects a blended rate applicable to the adjustments.
