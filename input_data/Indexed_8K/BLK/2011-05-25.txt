Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 19, 2011, BlackRock, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Barclays Capital Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representatives of the several underwriters listed therein (the "Underwriters"), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to the Underwriters $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Floating Rate Notes due 2013 (the "2013 Notes") and $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.250% Notes due 2021 (the "2021 Notes") (collectively, the "Notes"), for resale by the Underwriters (the "Offering") pursuant to the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-169328) (the "Registration Statement"). The Offering has resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $1.491 billion. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering, together with cash on hand and borrowings under its commercial paper program, to fund its previously announced repurchase of 13,562,878 shares of its Series B Convertible Participating Preferred Stock from affiliates of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. Closing of the repurchase is expected to occur on June 1, 2011, subject to customary closing conditions.
The Underwriters and their affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking, commercial lending, financial advisory and other services for the Company. They have received customary fees and expenses for these services. Some of the Underwriters and their affiliates are lenders, agents or dealers under the Company's revolving credit facility and commercial paper program.
The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Underwriting Agreement, a copy of which is attached as exhibit 1.1 to this current report on Form 8-K.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an Off-balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On May 24, 2011, the Company closed the Offering. The Notes are issued pursuant to the Senior Indenture, dated as of September 17, 2007, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York), as trustee (the "Indenture").
At any time and from time to time, the Company may redeem the 2021 Notes at a "make-whole" redemption price (as defined in the 2021 Notes). In the case of any such redemption, the Company will also pay accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. The 2013 Notes may not be redeemed at the Company's option before maturity.
Each of the following constitutes an event of default under the Indenture: (1) failure to pay any interest on any debt security of such series when due and payable, continued for 30 days; (2) failure to pay any principal when due of such series at its maturity; (3) failure to observe or perform any other of our covenants or agreements with respect to such debt securities for 60 days after we receive notice of such failure; or (4) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization.
The Indenture includes requirements that must be met if the Company consolidates or merges with, or sells all or substantially all of the Company's assets to, another entity.
The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Indenture, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 4.5 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, and the Notes, forms of which are attached as exhibits 4.1 and 4.2 to this current report on Form 8-K.

(e) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board or the President and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:
(i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
(ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any notice objecting to its use has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and
(iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there has been no material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).

References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (f) include any supplement thereto at the date of such letter.
provided
(g) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (f) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a reasonably foreseeable prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto) the effect of which, in any case referred to in
 
clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof), the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
(h) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.

7. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through the Representatives on demand for all expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
8. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
Indemnification and Contribution
 
of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and (ii) under the heading "Underwriting", (A) the names of Underwriters, (B) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (C) the paragraphs related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the
 
indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. An indemnifying party shall not be liable under this Section 8 to any indemnified party regarding any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding to which such indemnified party is or could have been a party and in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or consent is consented to by such indemnifying party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) in which case such indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified parties from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement, compromise or consent.
provided
however
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission
provided
however
 
applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the
Default by an Underwriter
provided
however
 
Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder. For purposes of this Section 9, if more than one series of Securities is specified in Schedule I hereto, this Section 9 shall apply to each series of Securities as if this Agreement applied solely to such series.
10. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such delivery and payment (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
Termination
11. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

The following description will apply to the Floating Rate Notes due 2013:
Floating Rate Notes due 2013
The Floating Rate Notes due 2013 (the "Floating Rate Notes") will mature on May 24, 2013. Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will be payable quarterly on February 24, May 24, August 24 and November 24 of each year subject to adjustment as specified below (each, a "Floating Interest Payment Date"), commencing on August 24, 2011, to the holders in whose names the Floating Rate Notes are registered at the close of business on February 9, May 9, August 9 and November 9, as applicable (which are the regular record dates), immediately preceding the related Floating Interest Payment Date.
The interest rate for the first Interest Period (as defined below) will be the three-month U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), as determined on May 20, 2011, plus a margin of 0.30% per annum. Thereafter, the interest rate for any Interest Period will be LIBOR (as defined below), as determined on the applicable Interest Determination Date (as defined below), plus a margin of 0.30% per annum. The interest rate will be reset quarterly on each Interest Reset Date (as defined below).
As long as any Floating Rate Notes are outstanding, we will maintain a Calculation Agent (as defined below) for calculating the interest rates on the Floating Rate Notes. The Bank of New York Mellon will act initially as calculation agent.
We will pay interest on the Floating Rate Notes on the Floating Interest Payment Dates stated above and at maturity. Each payment of interest due on a Floating Interest Payment Date or at maturity will include interest accrued from and including the last date to which interest has been paid or made available for payment, or from the issue date, if none has been paid or made available for payment, to but excluding the relevant payment date. For each Interest Period, interest will be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and a 360-day year.
With respect to the Floating Rate Notes, if any Interest Reset Date or Floating Interest Payment Date (other than the maturity date) would otherwise be a day that is not a Floating Rate Business Day, the relevant date will be postponed to the next day that is a Floating Rate Business Day, provided, however, that if that date would fall in the next succeeding calendar month, such date will be the immediately preceding Floating Rate Business Day. If any such Floating Interest Payment Date (other than the maturity date) is postponed or brought forward as described above, the payment of interest due on such postponed or brought forward Floating Interest Payment Date will include interest accrued to but excluding such postponed or brought forward Floating Interest Payment Date. If the maturity date falls on a day that is not a Floating Rate Business Day, payment of principal and interest on the Floating Rate Notes will be made on the next day that is a Floating Rate Business Day (as defined below), and no interest will accrue for the period from and after the maturity date. Postponement as described above will not result in a default under the Floating Rate Notes or the Indenture.
With respect to any Interest Determination Date, "LIBOR" will be the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having a maturity of three months commencing on the Interest Reset Date (as defined below) that appears on the designated LIBOR page as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Interest Determination Date. If no rate appears, LIBOR, in respect of that Interest Determination Date, will be determined as follows: the Calculation Agent will request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks in the London interbank market (which may include the Calculation Agent, any paying agents or their respective affiliates), as selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Issuer), to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in U.S. dollars for the period of three months, commencing on the Interest Reset Date, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, then LIBOR on that Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations (rounded if necessary to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with 0.000005 being rounded upwards). If fewer than two quotations are provided, then LIBOR on the Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean (rounded if necessary to the nearest one hundred-
 
thousandth of a percentage point, with 0.000005 being rounded upwards) of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Interest Determination Date by three major banks in The City of New York (which may include the Calculation Agent, the paying agents or their affiliates) selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Issuer) for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks, having a three-month maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at that time; provided, however, that if the banks selected by the Calculation Agent are not providing quotations in the manner described by this sentence, the rate of LIBOR for the next interest period will be set equal to the rate of LIBOR for the then current interest period. The designated LIBOR page is the Reuters screen "LIBOR01", or any successor service for the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks for U.S. dollars. The Reuters screen "LIBOR01" is the display designated as the Reuters screen "LIBOR01", or such other page as may replace the Reuters screen "LIBOR01" on that service or such other service or services as may be denominated by the British Bankers' Association for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates for U.S. dollar deposits. All calculations made by the Calculation Agent for the purposes of calculating the interest rate on the Floating Rate Notes shall be conclusive and binding on the holders of Floating Rate Notes, the Issuer and the trustee, absent manifest error.
"" means any day that is a New York Business Day and a London Banking Day.
Floating Rate Business Day
"" means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday that is not a day on which banking institutions in New York City are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.
New York Business Day
"" means any day on which commercial banks are open for general business (including dealings in foreign exchange and foreign currency deposits) in London.
London Banking Day
"" means, for each Interest Period other than the first Interest Period, the first day of such Interest Period, subject to adjustment in accordance with the day count convention specified above.
Interest Reset Date
"" means the period beginning on, and including, a Floating Interest Payment Date and ending on, but not including, the following Floating Interest Payment Date; provided that the first Interest Period will begin on May 24, 2011, and will end on, but not include, the first Floating Interest Payment Date.
Interest Period
"" means, for each Interest Reset Date, the day that is two London Banking Days preceding such Interest Reset Date.

THIS SECURITY MAY NOT BE EXCHANGED IN WHOLE OR IN PART FOR A SECURITY REGISTERED, AND NO TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY IN WHOLE OR IN PART MAY BE REGISTERED, IN THE NAME OF ANY PERSON OTHER THAN SUCH DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE THEREOF, EXCEPT IN THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE.
 
BlackRock, Inc., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Delaware (herein called the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of on May 24, 2013, and to pay interest thereon from May 24, 2011 or the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid, on February 24, May 24, August 24 and November 24 in each year, beginning on August 24, 2011 (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), at the interest rate calculated in accordance with the terms of this Security. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the February 9, May 9, August 9 and November 9 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.
                    
The interest rate for the first Interest Period (as defined below) will be the three-month U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), as determined on May 20, 2011, plus a margin of 0.30% per annum. Thereafter, the interest rate for any Interest Period will be LIBOR (as defined below), as determined on the applicable Interest Determination Date (as defined below), plus a margin of 0.30% per annum. The interest rate will be reset quarterly on each Interest Reset Date (as defined below). Each payment of interest due on an Interest Payment Date or at maturity will include interest accrued from and including the last date to which interest has been paid or made available for payment, or from May 24, 2011, if none has been paid or made available for payment, to but excluding the relevant payment date. For each Interest Period, interest will be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and a 360-day year. Promptly upon determination, the Calculation Agent will inform the Trustee and the Company of the interest rate for the next Interest Period.
If any Interest Reset Date or Interest Payment Date (other than the maturity date) would
otherwise be a day that is not a Floating Rate Business Day, the relevant date will be postponed to the next day that is a Floating Rate Business Day; provided, however, that if that date would fall in the next succeeding calendar month, such date will be the immediately preceding Floating Rate Business Day. If any such Interest Payment Date (other than the maturity date) is postponed or brought forward as described above, the payment of interest due on such postponed or brought forward Interest Payment Date will include interest accrued to but excluding such postponed or brought forward Interest Payment Date. If the maturity date falls on a day that is not a Floating Rate Business Day, payment of principal and interest on the Security will be made on the next day that is a Floating Rate Business Day (as defined below), and no interest will accrue for the period from and after the maturity date. Postponement as described above will not result in a default under this Security or the Indenture.
With respect to any Interest Determination Date, "LIBOR" will be the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having a maturity of three months commencing on the Interest Reset Date (as defined below) that appears on the designated LIBOR page as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Interest Determination Date. If no rate appears, LIBOR, in respect of that Interest Determination Date, will be determined as follows: the Calculation Agent will request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks in the London interbank market (which may include the Calculation Agent, any paying agents or their respective affiliates), as selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company), to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in U.S. dollars for the period of three months, commencing on the Interest Reset Date, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, then LIBOR on that Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations (rounded if necessary to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with 0.000005 being rounded upwards). If fewer than two quotations are provided, then LIBOR on the Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean (rounded if necessary to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with 0.000005 being rounded upwards) of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Interest Determination Date by three major banks in The City of New York (which may include the Calculation Agent, the paying agents or their affiliates) selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks, having a three-month maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at that time; provided, however, that if the banks selected by the Calculation Agent are not providing quotations in the manner described by this sentence, the rate of LIBOR for the next Interest Period will be set equal to the rate of LIBOR for the then current Interest Period. The designated LIBOR page is the Reuters screen "LIBOR01", or any successor service for the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks for U.S. dollars. The Reuters screen "LIBOR01" is the display designated as the Reuters screen "LIBOR01", or such other page as may replace the Reuters screen "LIBOR01" on that service or such other service or services as may be denominated by the British Bankers' Association for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates for U.S. dollar deposits. All calculations made by the Calculation Agent for the purposes of calculating the interest rate on this Security shall be conclusive and binding on the holders of this Security, the Company and the trustee, absent manifest error.
