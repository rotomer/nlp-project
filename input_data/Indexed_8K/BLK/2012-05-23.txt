Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Secondary Offering
On May 22, 2012, BlackRock, Inc. ("BlackRock") entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Secondary Offering Underwriting Agreement") by and among BlackRock and Barclays (BR Investments) LP (the "Selling Stockholder") and Barclays Capital Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the "Secondary Offering Underwriters"), pursuant to which the Selling Stockholder, a subsidiary of Barclays Bank PLC ("Barclays"), agreed to sell to the Secondary Offering Underwriters 26,211,335 shares of common stock of BlackRock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), including shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of BlackRock's Series B Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Series B Preferred Stock"), and 2,621,134 shares of Common Stock under the Secondary Offering Underwriters' option to purchase additional shares (which was exercised in full on May 23, 2012) (collectively, the "Secondary Offering Shares"), for resale by the Secondary Offering Underwriters (the "Secondary Offering") pursuant to BlackRock's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-169328) (the "Registration Statement"). BlackRock will not receive any of proceeds from the sale of Common Stock in the Secondary Offering.
BlackRock and the Selling Stockholder have agreed to indemnify the Secondary Offering Underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or to contribute to payments the Secondary Offering Underwriters may be required to make because of any of those liabilities. Closing is expected to occur on May 29, 2012 and is subject to customary closing conditions.
At March 31, 2012, wholly owned subsidiaries of Barclays owned approximately 2.2% of BlackRock's voting common stock outstanding and held approximately 19.6% of BlackRock's capital stock. Immediately upon completion of the Secondary Offering and the Repurchase (as defined below), BlackRock does not expect Barclays and its affiliates to own any shares of BlackRock's capital stock. Additionally, Barclays Capital Inc., an affiliate of Barclays, is acting as an underwriter in the Secondary Offering. Further, affiliates of other Secondary Offering Underwriters in the Secondary Offering own our capital stock.
The Secondary Offering Underwriters and their affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking, commercial lending, financial advisory and other services for BlackRock. The Secondary Offering Underwriters have received customary fees and expenses for these services. In particular, affiliates of the Secondary Offering Underwriters are dealers under BlackRock's commercial paper program. Affiliates of the Secondary Offering Underwriters are also lenders under BlackRock's $3.785 billion revolving credit facility maturing in 2017.
The foregoing summary of the Secondary Offering Underwriting Agreement is qualified by reference to the full text of the Secondary Offering Underwriting Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
Notes Offering
On May 22, 2012, BlackRock entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Notes Offering Underwriting Agreement") with Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters listed therein (the "Notes Offering Underwriters"), pursuant to which BlackRock agreed to sell to the Notes Offering Underwriters $750 million aggregate principal amount of its 1.375% Notes due 2015 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.375% Notes due 2022 (collectively, the "Notes"), for resale by the Notes Offering Underwriters (the "Notes Offering") pursuant to the Registration Statement. The Notes Offering is expected to result in net proceeds to BlackRock of approximately $1.49 billion. BlackRock intends to use the net proceeds from the Notes Offering to fund the Repurchase (as defined below), and for general corporate purposes, which may include repayments of its outstanding indebtedness.
BlackRock has agreed to indemnify the Notes Offering Underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the Notes Offering Underwriters may be required to make because of any of those liabilities. Closing is expected to occur on May 25, 2012 and is subject to customary closing conditions.
The Notes Offering Underwriters and their affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking, commercial lending, financial advisory and other services for BlackRock. The Notes Offering Underwriters have received customary fees and expenses for these services. In particular, affiliates of the Notes Offering Underwriters are dealers under BlackRock's commercial paper program. Affiliates of the Notes Offering Underwriters are also lenders under BlackRock's $3.785 billion revolving credit facility maturing in 2017.

Share Repurchase
On May 21, 2012, BlackRock entered into a stock repurchase agreement (the "Stock Repurchase Agreement") with Barclays, pursuant to which BlackRock agreed to purchase $1 billion of Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock from affiliates of Barclays at the price at which the shares of Common Stock are sold to the public in the Secondary Offering, less the underwriting discount (the "Repurchase"), or $156.80 per share, resulting in the repurchase of approximately 6.4 million shares.
Closing of the Repurchase is also conditioned on, and is expected to occur immediately after, the completion of the Secondary Offering and is subject to other customary closing conditions. BlackRock currently intends to use a portion of the proceeds of the Notes Offering to fund the Repurchase.
The foregoing summary of the Stock Repurchase Agreement is qualified by reference to the full text of the Stock Repurchase Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
Barclays Exchange
On May 21, 2012, BlackRock entered into an exchange agreement (the "Barclays Exchange Agreement") with Barclays, pursuant to which, if immediately following the closing of the Secondary Offering and the Repurchase, Barclays and its affiliates collectively beneficially own more than one percent of the outstanding Common Stock, BlackRock has agreed to issue an equal number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to such parties in exchange for such shares of Common Stock in excess of one percent of the outstanding Common Stock (the "Barclays Exchange"). The Barclays Exchange will be effected through a private exchange for which no commission or other remuneration has been paid or given for soliciting such exchange in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act.

The PNC Exchange will be effected through a private exchange for which no commission or other remuneration has been paid or given for soliciting such exchange in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act.
The foregoing summary of the PNC Exchange Agreement is qualified by reference to the full text of the PNC Exchange Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.3 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

Increase of Commercial Paper Program Capacity
On May 17, 2012, BlackRock's board of directors approved an increase in the maximum amount that may be borrowed under its existing commercial paper program (which program was previously described in BlackRock's Current Report on Form 8K, filed on October 20, 2009) from $3.5 billion to $3.785 billion.

Indemnification and Contribution
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter, its affiliates within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Act and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided, however
(b) The Selling Stockholder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter, its affiliates within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Act and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them
 
may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , that the Selling Stockholder will only be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with the Selling Stockholder Information relating to the Selling Stockholder; , that, for purposes of this Agreement, the Company and the Underwriters acknowledge that the only "Selling Stockholder Information" is the information about the Selling Stockholder set forth under the caption "Selling Stockholder" (other than the information regarding percentage of the Company's common stock, the Company's preferred equity and economic interest in the Company owned by the Selling Stockholder appearing under such caption). The liability of the Selling Stockholder under this indemnification provision shall be limited to an amount equal to the gross proceeds to the Selling Stockholder from the sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement.
provided, however
provided further
(c) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, and the Selling Stockholder and each person who controls the Selling Stockholder within the meaning of the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company or the Selling Stockholder, as applicable, to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company and the Selling Stockholder acknowledge that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and (ii) under the heading "Underwriting", (A) the names of Underwriters, (B) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances, and (C) the paragraphs related to stabilization and syndicate covering transactions in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
 
(d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) (b) or (c) above, as applicable, unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) above, as applicable. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. An indemnifying party shall not be liable under this Section 8 to any indemnified party regarding any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding to which such indemnified party is or could have been a party and in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or consent is consented to by such indemnifying party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) in which case such indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified parties from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement, compromise or consent.
provided, however
 
(e) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same) (collectively, "") to which the Company, the Selling Stockholder and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the benefits received by the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholder shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by them, respectively, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, and each person who controls the Selling Stockholder within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Selling Stockholder, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (e).
Losses
provided, however
(f) The provisions of this Section 8 shall not affect any agreement among the Company and the Selling Stockholder with respect to indemnification or contribution.
 
9. . In respect of each Closing Date or Date of Delivery, if any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the number of shares of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule A hereto bears to the number of shares of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , that in the event that the number of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the total number of Securities set forth in Schedule A hereto deliverable on such Closing Date or Date of Delivery, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities deliverable on such Closing Date or Date of Delivery, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter, the Selling Stockholder or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9(a), the relevant Closing Date or Date of Delivery, as the case may be, shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company, the Selling Stockholder and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
Default by an Underwriter
provided, however
10. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company and the Selling Stockholder prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities to be delivered on any Closing Date or Date of Delivery, if at any time prior to such delivery and payment (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
Termination
11. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Selling Stockholder or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

Successors
14. . Each of the Company and the Selling Stockholder hereby acknowledge that (a) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company and the Selling Stockholder, on the one hand, and the Underwriters and any affiliate through which it may be acting, on the other, (b) the Underwriters are acting as principal and not as an agent or fiduciary of the Company or the Selling Stockholder and (c) the Company's and the Selling Stockholder's engagement of the Underwriters in connection with the offering and the process leading up to the offering is as independent contractors and not in any other capacity. Furthermore, each of the Company and the Selling Stockholder agrees that it is solely responsible for making its own judgments in connection with the offering (irrespective of whether any of the Underwriters has advised or is currently advising the Company or the Selling Stockholder on related or other matters). Each of the Company and the Selling Stockholder agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters have rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owe an agency, fiduciary or similar duty to the Company or the Selling Stockholder, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
No Fiduciary Duty

1. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by all requisite corporate action on the part of the Company under the DGCL and, to the extent such execution and delivery are governed by the laws of the State of New York, has been duly executed and delivered by the Company under such laws.
2. Neither the execution and delivery by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the issuance of the Conversion Shares: (i) conflicts with the Organizational Documents, (ii) constitutes a violation of, or a default under, any Scheduled Contract, or (iii) contravenes any Scheduled Order.
3. Neither the execution and delivery by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the issuance of the Conversion Shares: (i) violates any law, rule or regulation of the State of New York or the United States of America, or (ii) requires the consent, approval, licensing or authorization of, or any filing, recording or registration with, any governmental authority under any law, rule or regulation of the State of New York or the United States of America except for those consents, approvals, licenses and authorizations already obtained and those filings, recordings and registrations already made.
4. To our knowledge, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company is a party or to which any property of the Company is subject that are required to be disclosed in the General Disclosure Package and Prospectus pursuant to Item 103 of Regulation S-K of the Rules and Regulations that are not so disclosed.
5. The shares of Common Stock initially issuable upon conversion of the Secondary Series B Shares pursuant to the Certificate of Designation (the "Conversion Shares") have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of the Company under the DGCL and, when issued upon conversion of the Secondary Series B Shares in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designation, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
6. The Securities being sold by the Selling Stockholder, other than the Conversion Shares, have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of the Company under the DGCL and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

8. The Company is not and, solely after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities as described in the Prospectus and the General Disclosure Package, will not be subject to registration and regulation as an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
 
9. Under current United States federal income tax law, although the discussion set forth in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus under the caption "Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders" does not purport to discuss all possible United States federal income tax consequences that could apply to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Securities, under current United States federal income tax law, such discussion, insofar as it relates to the specific terms of the Securities, constitutes, in all material respects, a fair and accurate summary of the United States federal income tax considerations that are anticipated to be material to Investors who are Non-U.S. Holders (as defined under the caption "Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus) and who purchase the Securities pursuant to the Prospectus.

(h) The Company agrees that, unless it has or shall have obtained the prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) of the Representatives, and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees with the Company that, unless it has or shall have obtained, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company, it has
 
not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433, other than a free writing prospectus containing the information contained in the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto; provided that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule III hereto and any electronic road show. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives or the Company is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (x) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (y) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.
(i) The Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Company or any affiliate of the Company or any person in privity with the Company or any affiliate of the Company), directly or indirectly, including the filing (or participation in the filing) of a registration statement with the Commission in respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company (other than the Securities) or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction, until the Business Day set forth in Schedule I hereto.
(j) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities.
(k) The Company, during the period when a prospectus relating to the Securities is (or, but for the exception afforded by Rule 172, would be) required to be delivered under the Act, will file all documents required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act within the time periods required by the Exchange Act and the regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder.
(l) The Company agrees to pay the costs and expenses relating to the following matters: (i) the preparation, printing or reproduction and filing with the Commission of the Registration Statement (including financial statements and exhibits thereto), each Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and each amendment or supplement to any of them; (ii) the printing (or reproduction) and delivery (including postage, air freight charges and charges for counting and packaging) of such copies of the Registration Statement, each Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and all amendments or supplements
 
to any of them, as may, in each case, be reasonably requested for use in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities; (iii) the preparation, printing, authentication, issuance and delivery of certificates for the Securities, including any stamp or transfer taxes in connection with the original issuance and sale of the Securities; (iv) the printing (or reproduction) and delivery of this Agreement, any blue sky memorandum and all other agreements or documents printed (or reproduced) and delivered in connection with the offering of the Securities; (v) the registration, if any, of the Securities under the Exchange Act; (vi) any registration or qualification of the Securities for offer and sale under the securities or blue sky laws of the several states (including filing fees and the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters relating to such registration and qualification); (vii) any filings required to be made with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (including filing fees and the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters relating to such filings); (viii) the transportation and other expenses incurred by or on behalf of Company representatives in connection with presentations to prospective purchasers of the Securities; (ix) the fees and expenses of the Company's accountants and the fees and expenses of counsel (including local and special counsel) for the Company; and (x) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder.
6. . The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company contained herein as of the Execution Time and the Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company made in any certificates pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:

(b) The Company shall have requested and caused Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, counsel for the Company, to have furnished to the Representatives their opinion, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A.

Date and addressed to the Representatives, with respect to such matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
(e) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board or the President and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:
(i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
(ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any notice objecting to its use has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and
(iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there has been no material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
(f) The Company shall have requested and caused Deloitte & Touche LLP to have furnished to the Representatives, at the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, letters, (which may refer to letters previously delivered to one or more of the Representatives), dated respectively as of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information with respect to the Company incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus; that the letter delivered on the Closing Date shall use a "cut-off date" not earlier than the date hereof. References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (f) include any supplement thereto at the date of such letter.
provided
(g) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (f) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a reasonably foreseeable prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or
 
contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto) the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof), the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
(h) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.

Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.
The documents required to be delivered by this Section 6 shall be delivered at the office of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, at One Liberty Plaza, New York, New York 10006, on the Closing Date.
7. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through the Representatives on demand for all expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
8. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or
Indemnification and Contribution
 
otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and (ii) under the heading "Underwriting", (A) the names of Underwriters, (B) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (C) the paragraphs related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided
 
in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. An indemnifying party shall not be liable under this Section 8 to any indemnified party regarding any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding to which such indemnified party is or could have been a party and in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or consent is consented to by such indemnifying party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) in which case such indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified parties from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement, compromise or consent.
provided
however
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in
provided
however
 
any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities,
Default by an Underwriter
provided
however
 
this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder. For purposes of this Section 9, if more than one series of Securities is specified in Schedule I hereto, this Section 9 shall apply to each series of Securities as if this Agreement applied solely to such series.
10. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such delivery and payment (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
Termination
11. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

Furthermore, the Company agrees that it is solely responsible for making its own judgments in connection with the offering (irrespective of whether any of the Underwriters has advised or is currently advising the Company on related or other matters). The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters have rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owe an agency, fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.

The Note Certificates have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of the Company and duly executed by the Company under the DGCL and, to the extent such execution and delivery are governed by the laws of the State of New York, has been duly executed and delivered by the Company under such laws, and when duly authenticated by the Trustee and issued and delivered by the Company against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, the Note Certificates will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms under the laws of the State of New York.
4. Neither the execution and delivery by the Company of the Transaction Agreements nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the issuance and sale of the Securities: (i) conflicts with the Organizational Documents, (ii) constitutes a violation of, or a default under, any Scheduled Contract, or (iii) contravenes any Scheduled Order.
5. Neither the execution and delivery by the Company of the Transaction Agreements nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the issuance and sale of the Securities: (i) violates any law, rule or regulation of the State of New York or the United States of America, or (ii) requires the consent, approval, licensing or authorization of, or any filing, recording or registration with, any governmental authority under any law, rule or regulation of the State of New York or the United States of America except for those consents, approvals, licenses and authorizations already obtained and those filings, recordings and registrations already made.
6. To our knowledge, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company is a party or to which any property of the Company is subject that are required to be disclosed in the Preliminary Prospectus and Prospectus pursuant to Item 103 of Regulation S-K of the Rules and Regulations that are not so disclosed.
7. The statements in the Prospectus and the General Disclosure Package under the captions "Description of the Notes" and "Description of Debt Securities," insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the Indenture and the Securities, fairly summarize such provisions in all material respects.
8. The Company is not and, solely after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus and the General Disclosure Package, will not be subject to registration and regulation as an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
9. We are of the opinion that under current United States federal income tax law, although the discussion set forth in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus under the caption "Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders" does not purport to discuss all possible United States federal income tax consequences that could apply to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Securities, under current United States federal income tax law, such discussion, insofar as it relates to the specific terms of the Securities, constitutes, in all material respects, a fair and accurate summary of the United States federal income tax considerations that are anticipated to be material to Investors who are Non-U.S. Holders as defined under the caption "Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus who purchase the Securities pursuant to the Prospectus.
10. (i) The Registration Statement, at the Effective Time (as defined below), and the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations (except that in each case we do not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the Statement of Eligibility on Form T  1 (the "Form T  1"), to the extent included or incorporated by reference therein) and (ii) no facts have come to our attention that have caused us to believe that the Registration Statement, at the Effective Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement and as of the date hereof contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that in each case we do not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom, the report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting or the auditors' attestation report thereon, or the statements contained in the exhibits to the Registration Statement, including the Form T  1, to the extent included or incorporated by reference therein). In addition, on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to our attention that have caused us to believe that the General Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that we do not express any view as to the
financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom, the report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting or the auditors' attestation report thereon, or the statements contained in the exhibits to the Registration Statement, including the Form T  1, to the extent included or incorporated by reference therein).
As used herein, (i) "Effective Time" means the time of effectiveness of the Registration Statement for purposes of Section 11 of the Securities Act, as such section applies to the Underwriters, (ii) "Applicable Time" means 3:37 p.m. (Eastern time) on May 22, 2012 and (iii) "General Disclosure Package" means the Preliminary Prospectus and the Free Writing Prospectus, all considered together.
In addition, based on the foregoing, we confirm to you that (i) the Prospectus has been filed with the Commission within the time period required by Rule 424 of the Rules and Regulations and (ii) the Free Writing Prospectus has been filed with the Commission within the time period required by Rule 433(d) of the Rules and Regulations.
1. The execution and delivery by the Company of each of the Transaction Documents and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the issuance and sale of the Securities, will not, to the best of my knowledge, contravene any provision of any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its subsidiaries that is material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (the "Applicable Contracts"). I do not express any opinion, however, as to whether the execution, delivery or performance by the Company of each of the Transaction Documents will constitute a violation of, or a default under, any covenant, restriction or provision with respect to financial ratios or tests or any aspect of the financial condition or results of operations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
2. The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
3. Each significant subsidiary of the Company, as defined in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X (each, a "Significant Subsidiary"), that has been incorporated or formed under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation, is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of such jurisdiction.
4. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries has the full corporate power and authority to own or lease, as the case may be, its properties and conduct its business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, except where the failure to have such corporate power and corporate authority would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
