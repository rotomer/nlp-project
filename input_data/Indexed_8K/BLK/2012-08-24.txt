Current Terms
Summary
(ii) With respect to any Covered Product first Distributed by a Merrill Lynch Distributor after the date hereof and also distributed through non Merrill Lynch Distributors, other than any Covered Product that falls within a category, type or platform to which the Current Terms apply in accordance with Section 4(a)(i), the Merrill Lynch Distributors shall be offered the most favorable economic terms offered by BlackRock to other distributors of such Product. If any Covered Product, other than any Covered Product that falls within a category, type or platform to which the Current Terms apply in accordance with Section 4(a)(i), becomes part of a group or program of similar products distributed by the Merrill Lynch Distributors, some of which Products are sponsored by managers other than BlackRock, the economic terms offered by the Merrill Lynch Distributor to BlackRock for the Distribution of such Covered Product shall be at least as favorable to BlackRock and the Covered Product as the most favorable economic terms to which any of such Products is entitled. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this clause (ii), (A) no Merrill Lynch Distributor shall be required to extend to a Covered Product, and BlackRock shall not be required to extend to the Merrill Lynch Distributors, the most favorable economic terms that the Merrill Lynch Distributors or BlackRock, respectively, may provide to managers or Distributors, as the case may be, with respect to a Product that a Merrill Lynch Distributor or BlackRock, as the case may be, reasonably determines represents a unique or substantially differentiated opportunity relative to the relevant Covered Product or the Distribution, respectively, offered by BlackRock or Merrill Lynch; , , that the foregoing exception shall not apply to the terms Merrill Lynch may provide to any Product managed by a Merrill Lynch Alternative Manager that could reasonably be considered to be a competing product; and (B) no Product managed by a Merrill Lynch Alternative Manager that could reasonably be considered to be a competing product may be offered through any platform of Merrill Lynch's Global Private Client business (as renamed or restructured from time to time) prior to completion of twelve months after the later of (i) the date such

(iii) With respect to any Merrill Lynch Distributor that does not at the time in question Distribute a particular Covered Product, Merrill Lynch will, upon the request of BlackRock, use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Distribution of any Covered Products by such Merrill Lynch Distributor as so requested by BlackRock on the same terms as provided above in Section 4(a)(i) and (ii), subject to Requirements of Law and the Applicable Standards and Practices of the applicable Merrill Lynch Distributor.
(iv) Subject to Requirements of Law and to Applicable Standards and Practices and excepting the Yield Support Agreement, the economic terms attaching to each Covered Product as referred to in Section 4(a)(i) shall remain in effect until the end of the initial term set forth in Section 12(a) (the "").

In the event that Requirements of Law or Applicable Standards and Policies require any modification to the economic terms with respect to Covered Products to which the Current Terms apply in accordance with Section 4(a)(i), such modifications shall be made so as to result in the minimum necessary deviation from the Current Terms.
(vi) The Parties will conduct themselves so that any changes to the economic terms of any Covered Product (excepting the Yield Support Agreement) required to be made by Section 4(a) (other than on account of changes in Requirements of Law) will be balanced by other changes, opportunities, products, strategies, initiatives or arrangements that the Parties agree will be economically neutral across the Covered Products and only effected consistently with Section 4(h) below.
(b) Merrill Lynch will not, and will cause each Merrill Lynch Distributor not to, provide to its Sales Force for the sale of Products that are not Covered Products and that would generally be viewed as competitive with the applicable Covered Products (including, to
 
the extent relevant, product type and/or class and asset class and style) in the channel in question any compensation or economic inducement or benefit that is greater than that provided to such Sales Force for the sale of such Covered Products in such channel, , that this provision is not intended to prohibit a Merrill Lynch Distributor from selling Products that provide for different rates of sales load, placementRule 12b-1, trailing commissions or other related fees (., Class A shares for different Products or funds that have different sales compensation structures).

(ii) In addition, Merrill Lynch will not implement or execute a business program that is intentionally designed to cause multiple Merrill Lynch customers holding such MLIM money market fund shares to redeem such shares for transfers to bank deposit products of the Merrill Lynch banks.
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, in case of a direct or indirect acquisition by Merrill Lynch of the assets or business of another entity engaged in the Distribution of Products whether or not competitive with the applicable Covered Products in the channel in question, (i) no such acquisition will limit or restrict any obligation of any Merrill Lynch Distributor to Distribute Covered Products pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any Selling Agreement, as applicable, and (ii) at the request of BlackRock, Merrill Lynch shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause such newly acquired Merrill Lynch Distributor to Distribute Covered Products on the same basis as set forth in Section 4(a), subject to Requirements of Law, Applicable Standards and Practices and any contractual provisions such acquired business is subject to immediately prior to the execution of the related acquisition agreement ( that such contractual provision was not entered into in connection with, as a part of or in preparation for, such acquisition).

For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of the merger or combination of any MLIM Product with respect to which BlackRock is required to make such payments under a Selling Agreement into a BlackRock Product with respect to which BlackRock
e.g.
 
is required to make similar payments at differing rates, BlackRock shall, until the expiration of this Agreement and the existing terms and conditions pertaining to such payments and subject to applicable fiduciary duties and Requirements of Law, make payments at a weighted average rate determined by the ratio of the net asset value of the relevant MLIM Product immediately prior to the merger or combination and the net asset value of the relevant BlackRock Product immediately after the merger or combination immediately after giving effect to the merger or combination. For purposes of any such relevant payments that are asset-based payments, such weighted average rate shall be applied to all assets under management of the BlackRock Product, whether such assets were under management before or are under management after the merger or combination.

(g) Subject to Requirements of Law and to Applicable Standards and Practices, Merrill Lynch agrees to provide BlackRock with prompt notice which shall in no event be less than six months (or such shorter period as to which BlackRock may agree to) prior to implementation of any formal initiative under serious consideration to make any material change to any platform that offers or makes available any Covered Product, or the manner in which any Merrill Lynch Distributor conducts its business, in either case that could reasonably be expected to result in a loss of revenue or business opportunity for BlackRock with respect to such Covered Product. Such change may only be made subject to the terms of Section 4(h) below.
(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any changes or amendments to economic terms or the manner in which Covered Products are offered through Merrill Lynch or a Merrill Lynch Distributor contemplated by Sections 4(a), or (g) of this Agreement (a "") shall only be effected subsequent to the completion of the following procedures designed to ensure economic neutrality for BlackRock:

The average price to revenue ratio shall be determined by dividing (x) the average closing price of BlackRock's common stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange for the 60 trading days immediately preceding the notice given pursuant to Section 4(h)(i) by (y) BlackRock's reported revenue for the four quarters immediately preceding the notice.
Buyback Resolution
