Message from Larry Fink Sent June 20, 2012
Im writing to let you know that Sue Wagner, a Founding Partner of BlackRock, has decided to retire from her role as a Vice Chairman of the firm and has been elected to our Board of Directors.  Sue will retire at the end of this month and take her seat on the Board at the October meeting. She also will continue to serve as a Director of our joint venture in India, DSP BlackRock Investment Managers.
Sues election to the BlackRock Board reflects the profound contribution that she has made and continues to make to the success of our firm.  I am delighted that she will be able to continue to have a significant positive impact on our business through her important new role on our Board.
Sue has played a central role in the growth and development of BlackRock over the past 25 years.  Six months ago she first came to me and raised the possibility of retirement at some point in the future, and weve since worked through a smooth transition.  Patrick Olson, whose appointment as Global Head of Strategy and Planning we announced on June 1, will report to me on matters of corporate strategy and development, and to Ann Marie Petach on his leadership of the business finance group.
To borrow a line from our brand, BlackRock is built for these times in large part because of the amazing work Sue has done, year after year, to help make us who we are today.  Sue has spearheaded every critical corporate transaction in our history: from the partnership agreement with Blackstone that founded our company in 1988 and our sale to PNC in 1994, through our IPO in 1999, to secondary offerings by Bank of America in 2010 and most recently by Barclays which, thanks to Sues typically superb leadership, was oversubscribed and highly successful.
Sue has also led every one of our strategic acquisitions, including our combinations with HPB, State Street, MLIM, Quellos fund of funds business and BGI.  And, she played a pivotal role in the genesis of many of the businesses that have become central to our success, including launching our international business in 1988 and our first alternatives effort in 1994.  She also was instrumental in creating our first hedge fund  Obsidian  in 1996 and in launching BlackRock Solutions in 2000.
Each of these strategic moves was critical in assembling the unmatched breadth of capabilities we have today.  Sue was in there on the ground floor on each occasion  listening to our clients, understanding their challenges and finding innovative solutions to meet their needs.
Sue embodies and has helped to define and foster the culture of consistent excellence, uncompromising integrity, deep passion and intense focus on our clients that is BlackRock at its best.  She is a role model for many people at BlackRock and has continually invested herself and her time in nurturing a new generation of talent. Her global sponsorship of WIN, the BlackRock womens network, is just one example of how she has helped to advance the careers of many individuals  women and men  at BlackRock.
As Sue begins a new chapter in her remarkable career, all of us are grateful that we will be able to draw on her spirit of innovation and unmatched depth of understanding of the markets, our industry and our firm in her new role as a Director of BlackRock.
I hope you will join me in congratulating Sue on her appointment to the Board and in expressing our enduring gratitude to her for the vital role she has played in making possible our shared success.
