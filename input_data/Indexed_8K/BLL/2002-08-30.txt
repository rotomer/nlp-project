Exhibit 99.1Following is the text of a press release disseminated by the registrant on August 30, 2002:  10 Longs Peak Drive, Broomfield, Colorado 80021-2510Investor Contact:          Ann Scott        303.460.3537, Media Contact:             Scott McCarty    303.460.2103,                                                 BROOMFIELD, Colo., Aug. 29, 2002--Ball Corporation [NYSE:BLL] announced today that it has agreed toacquire Schmalbach-Lubeca AG, the second largest beverage can manufacturer in Europe.  Combined, the twocompanies produce more than 45 billion beverage cans annually in North America and Europe.  Ball will beacquiring the German-based company for approximately 900 million euros in cash and the assumption ofapproximately 16 million euros of net debt.  The final purchase price is subject to working capital and otherpost-closing adjustments.  The transaction is expected to close in late 2002 or early 2003.         Schmalbach-Lubeca, headquartered in Ratingen, Germany, operates 12 manufacturing plants--four each in Germany andGreat Britain, two in France and one each in the Netherlands and Poland.  The company produces more than 12billion aluminum and steel beverage cans and easy-opening can ends, employs approximately 2,500 people and hasforecasted sales in 2002 in excess of $1 billion.         "This strategic acquisition will provide better geographic balance in our largest product line, and itwill give us a major presence in the world's second largest market for beverage cans," said R. David Hoover,chairman, president and chief executive officer of Ball Corporation. "The addition of Schmalbach-Lubeca willprovide Ball a solid number two position in Europe to go with our number one position in the larger NorthAmerican market."         Hoover said the acquisition of Schmalbach-Lubeca is immediately expected to earn in excess of Ball'scost of capital and to be accretive to Ball's full year 2003 results by more than 15 percent.  Also in 2003,Schmalbach-Lubeca should add significantly to Ball's already strong cash flow from operations.  He said theacquisition will have little or no effect on Ball's 2002 earnings per share.                                                     - more -Ball Corp. - 2         The European beverage can industry supplied approximately 38 billion units in 2001, an increase of morethan 7 percent over 2000.  Schmalbach-Lubeca has approximately 31 percent of the installed beverage canmanufacturing capacity in Europe.         "We believe there is an excellent fit between Schmalbach-Lubeca and Ball.  Like Ball, Schmalbach-Lubecahas a highly skilled workforce, excellent manufacturing facilities, strong research and development capabilitiesand an experienced and successful management team," Hoover said.  "The European market has been growing and thecustomer base is consolidating. This represents an excellent opportunity for a company like Schmalbach-Lubeca,which enjoys superior customer relations and a solid reputation for quality and innovation.  We see tremendousopportunity for best practices sharing from the combination of our companies."         After the transaction, Schmalbach-Lubeca will be operated as a wholly owned European subsidiary of Ball.  Hooversaid that Hanno C. Fiedler, chairman and chief executive officer of Schmalbach-Lubeca, is expected to become anexecutive vice president of Ball Corporation and head of Ball's new European operations.  Completion of theacquisition is subject to various conditions, including regulatory approvals.         "This is a large and strategically important acquisition for Ball Corporation," Hoover said.  "It is similar insize and scope to the acquisition we made in 1998 of the Reynolds Metals beverage can manufacturing assets inNorth America.  That was very much a synergy driven acquisition, and the integration of that business into Ballis complete and has been highly successful.         "Our strong cash flow from that acquisition and the rest of our operations has allowed us to pay down debt andposition ourselves to take this next step in the continuing consolidation of worldwide packaging businesses,"Hoover said.  "Schmalbach's strong performance and cash flow will make it immediately accretive to Ball.  We alsobelieve that we will be able to improve both companies over time by building on their historic strengths of highquality and greatest value and coupling those strengths with our rigorous approach to managing operations."         Raymond J. Seabrook, Ball senior vice president and chief financial officer, said the transaction willbe financed with borrowings from banking institutions that have already provided a commitment to Ball, subject tospecified closing conditions.  The company will refinance its existing bank debt.  Its existing public bonds willremain in place.  Ball will assume Schmalbach-Lubeca's German pension liabilities of approximately 250 millioneuros.                                                     - more -Ball Corp. - 3         "We have aggressively paid down debt since our last major acquisition," Seabrook said.  "That allows usto make this acquisition without using equity and still maintain very solid credit statistics.  We expect tomaintain our current credit ratings after this transaction is complete. Our pro forma leverage will be threetimes debt to EBITDA compared to 4.4 times following the 1998 acquisition."         Since the sale of its plastic container and White Cap closure businesses earlier this year, Schmalbach-Lubecaconsists entirely of its beverage can business.  The company has been in the packaging industry throughout its historyand introduced the beverage can in Germany in 1953.         Ball Corporation is one of the world's leading suppliers of metal and plastic packaging to the beverage andfood industries.  The company also owns Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp.  Ball reported 2001 sales of $3.7 billion,of which approximately $3.3 billion came from its packaging segment and $400 million from its aerospace and technologies segment.Ball Corporation will hold a conference call and Web cast (including slides) to discuss this news release at 8 a.m.Mountain Daylight Time on Friday, Aug. 30, 2002.
