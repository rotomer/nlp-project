[GRAPHIC OMITTED]                       Ball Corporation  10 Longs Peak Drive, Broomfield, Colorado 80021-2510Investor Contact: Ann Scott              303.460.3537, ascott@ball.comMedia Contact: Scott McCarty             303.460.2103, smccarty@ball.com                                                           BROOMFIELD, Colo., April 24, 2003--Ball Corporation [NYSE:BLL] today reported first quarter earnings attributable tocommon shareholders of $31.5 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.07 billion, compared to $27.5 million, or48 cents per diluted share, on sales of $876 million in the first quarter of 2002.  The 2003 results include an after-tax chargeof approximately $900,000 related to the previously announced closure of Ball's food can manufacturing plant in Blytheville, Ark.         The first quarter of 2003 included full period results from Ball Packaging Europe, acquired in December 2002.  Sales andper share earnings were both records for a Ball first quarter, even though Ball Packaging Europe, the second largest manufacturerof beverage cans in Europe, was slightly dilutive in the quarter due to purchase accounting adjustments, business seasonality andthe imposition of deposits on one-way packaging in Germany.  With the European addition, Ball now reports results for threesegments instead of the previous two.  The former packaging segment has been divided into North American packaging andinternational packaging.  The aerospace and technologies segment remains the same.         R. David Hoover, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said that very strong results from the aerospace andtechnologies segment contributed significantly to the improved results in 2003 over the first quarter of 2002.  Aerospace sales andoperating earnings were both records for any quarter, Hoover said.         "We had a challenging quarter for our packaging segments, as we knew we would, and we are pleased with the way ouroperations are meeting those challenges," Hoover said.  "Meanwhile our aerospace and technologies segment continued its strongperformance."                                                               - more -Ball Corp - 2         Earnings in the North American packaging segment were $55.6 million, including the charge to close the Blytheville plant,compared to $55.3 million in the first quarter of 2002.  Sales were $711 million compared to $718 million a year ago.         "Adverse winter weather in several regions of the country contributed to lower beverage can sales for us and the industryin the first three months of 2003, however, operating results were higher," Hoover said.  "Our food can sales and operating resultswere lower due to startup delays and costs associated with our new two-piece metal food can manufacturing line in Milwaukee andprice/cost compression in the marketplace.  We continue to work on the line to get it to our operating standards and have had someof our new employees from our European acquisition in Milwaukee helping start up that line.  We anticipate steady improvement inits performance.  Sales of plastic bottles, primarily to the soft drink and water industries, increased over the same period in2002, though the growth was less than anticipated due to the harsh winter weather in many areas."         During the quarter Ball acquired Metal Packaging International (MPI), a producer of approximately two billion beverage canends, for approximately $28 million and announced that it would consolidate MPI's volumes into existing Ball plants and close MPI'slone manufacturing facility.  Ball also announced the closure of the Blytheville plant, its smallest metal food can manufacturingfacility.  The closure will occur in the second quarter.         The new international packaging reporting segment is made up of Ball Packaging Europe and Ball Asia-Pacific, Ltd.  For thequarter, segment earnings were $14.3 million on sales of $229 million.         International packaging segment results were hurt by the Jan. 1, 2003, imposition of a deposit on all one-way beveragepackaging in Germany, where four of Ball Packaging Europe's 12 manufacturing plants are located.  The imposition of the depositbefore an effective nationwide return system was in place resulted in a sharp decrease in sales of beverages in one-way packages inGermany.  The situation is expected to improve once the return system is in place and operating.         "The rest of Ball Packaging Europe had a good first quarter and we expect German results to improve once the deposittransition period is over," Hoover said.  "Sales in China were flat compared to a year ago while operating results were higher inthe first quarter as we continue to see the benefits of the major restructuring we did to our operations there.  It is too early todetermine what the consequences of the SARS outbreak will be on our China business, but thus far it appears to have been minimal."                                                               - more -Ball Corp. - 3         The aerospace and technologies segment had operating earnings of $16.1 million in the quarter on sales of $132 million,compared to $9.8 million on sales of $123 million in the first quarter a year ago.         "Aerospace had a great first quarter, boosted in part by completion and milestone payments it received related to the Ice,Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) spacecraft we provided for NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center," Hoover said.  "Also, wecontinue to see strong demand from the defense arena for the products and services we provide."         ICESat commissioning was completed in February.  The primary role of ICESat is to quantify the growth or retreat of theice sheets covering Antarctica and Greenland.  The mission is designed to answer questions concerning many related aspects of theEarth's climate system, including global climate changes and changes in sea level.         Raymond J. Seabrook, senior vice president and chief financial officer, said interest expense increased from $17.4 milliona year ago to $32 million in 2003, the result of borrowings to finance the approximately $920 million acquisition of Ball PackagingEurope.         "We are committed to deleveraging the balance sheet and continue to look for ways to increase free cash flow," Seabrooksaid.  "Our latest estimate of 2003 capital spending is $175 million, down from our earlier estimate of $200 million."         Hoover said, "We anticipate greater seasonality in our results with the addition of Ball Packaging Europe.  We said inJanuary that we expected Ball Packaging Europe to be dilutive in the first quarter, and it was.  We expect it to be accretivebeginning with the second quarter.  In Europe the demand for beverage cans is much higher in the second and third quarters than itis in the first and fourth.  While the same is true in North America, the seasonality is more pronounced in Europe.         "Aerospace should have a record year in sales and earnings, though the sharp earnings spike we saw in the first quarterbecause of the ICESat payments isn't something that will be sustained," Hoover said.  "We do anticipate increased demand for someof our products due to the replenishment of various systems expended in Iraq.  As a result of that and other opportunities, weexpect to see a large increase in our aerospace orders backlog by year-end.         "Taken all together, we continue to expect 2003 earnings to exceed $3.60 per diluted share, with second half results beingslightly greater than those of the first six months," Hoover said.                                                               - more -Ball Corp. - 4         Ball Corporation is one of the world's leading suppliers of metal and plastic packaging to the beverage and foodindustries.  The company also owns Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp.  With the addition of Ball Packaging Europe, acquired inDecember 2002, Ball expects to report 2003 sales of approximately $5 billion, of which approximately $4.5 billion will come fromits two packaging segments and $500 million from its aerospace and technologies segment.
