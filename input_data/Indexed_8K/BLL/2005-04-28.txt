News Release
 
Ball Announces Record First Quarter Earnings
 
BROOMFIELD, Colo., April 28, 2005Ball Corporation [NYSE:BLL] today reported first quarter earnings of $58.6 million, or 51 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.32 billion, compared to $46.8 million, or 41 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.23 billion in the first quarter of 2004.
For the second year in a row, both sales and earnings were records for a Ball first quarter. Improvement in sales in all three of the company's business segments contributed to the record results.
R. David Hoover, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said part of the improvement in 2005 was due to some of Ball's metal food can customers buying more product than would be normal in advance of price increases brought about by the rising cost of steel used to manufacture the cans. He also noted that lower selling and administrative costs and the decline of the U.S. dollar against the euro and Canadian dollar compared to a year ago contributed to the company's improved first quarter earnings.
North American Packaging Segment
Earnings in the company's North American packaging segment were $78.3
million on sales of $844 million, compared to $66.6 million on sales of $787 million in the first quarter of 2004.
"In addition to the strong demand for steel food cans in the quarter, we had a full quarter's results from our large metal food can plant in California this year where in the first quarter of 2004 we had only two weeks' results after acquiring the facility late in the quarter," Hoover said. "Sales of PET plastic bottles also were up over the first quarter of 2004, due in part to increased sales of Heat-Tek bottles for hot-filled beverages. Sales of metal beverage containers were below last year's levels as a result of poor weather, changes in customer locations we serve and downtime needed to complete the conversion of a production line to 24-ounce cans from 12-ounce cans."

The conversion of that manufacturing line in Ball's Golden, Colo., plant is nearly complete and will enable Ball to more efficiently meet the growing demand for 24-ounce cans while adding flexibility elsewhere in the company's system to manufacture other can sizes. Ball is one of the largest suppliers of custom beverage cans in the world.
International Packaging Segment
Earnings in the international packaging segment were $30.3 million on sales of $298 million, compared to $27.6 million on sales of $284 million in the first quarter of 2004. Currency gains and lower operating costs in our European operations were somewhat offset by a small charge in China for the full write-off of an equity-owned joint venture.
"We saw modest sales growth in both China and Europe in the first quarter of 2005," Hoover said. "Demand for beverage cans in Germany remains weak but that is being offset somewhat by stronger demand elsewhere in Europe. We are encouraged by what appears to be progress towards an acceptable, workable solution to the German deposit situation, though we do not expect a meaningful turnaround there in 2005. Meanwhile, we continue to take steps to adapt to the disruption and better position ourselves, including the recent conversion of a line at our plant in the Netherlands from the production of steel cans to aluminum cans."
The start up of Ball's new metal beverage can plant in Belgrade, Serbia, remains on schedule for the second quarter of 2005. The Belgrade plant will strengthen Ball's ability to meet the growing demand in Eastern Europe.
Aerospace and Technologies Segment
The aerospace and technologies segment had earnings of $8.9 million on sales of $182 million in the quarter, compared to $11.2 million on sales of $160 million in the first quarter of 2004. The lower earnings compared to a year ago were the result of a $3.8 million write-down of a small aerospace equity investment to net realizable value. Management intends to complete the sale of this non-strategic investment before the end of 2005.
"We are pleased with the progress we are making and we
are expanding our facilities and capabilities to keep pace with the growth," Hoover said. "Ball Aerospace is winning new business and at the same time completing a few long-lived projects that have been pulling down our margins."

During the first quarter Ball was selected by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center to build the Global Precipitation-Microwave Imager as part of an international effort to complete a constellation of spacecraft to improve climate and weather predictions.
Outlook
"Ball Corporation has enjoyed much success in recent years, and we are pleased that 2005, the 125
th
year of our company, began with a record first quarter," Hoover said. "Still, we realize the exceptionally strong performance of our food can operations in the first quarter likely is due to timing and came at the expense of the rest of the year.
"We expect our plastic container operations to continue to show improvement over last year. As is always the case, weather and customer promotion activities will help determine the results in our packaging operations. Our international segment should benefit from the addition during the second quarter of our new beverage can plant in Serbia and from good demand in China and much of Europe except Germany. Our aerospace and technologies segment should have a full year better than the last two, which were the best two in its history," Hoover said.
Raymond J. Seabrook, senior vice president and chief financial officer, said, "As we look to the full year, capital spending could somewhat exceed $300 million and our share repurchase program may exceed $175 million rather than the $150 million previously anticipated. Full year free cash flow still is tracking in the $225 million range."
"Even with all of the positives, we know 2005 will be challenging with cost pressures throughout our packaging businesses and accommodating the growth in our aerospace and technologies segment," Hoover said. "We are excited by our capital investments in our best performing product lines as we prepare our businesses for future profitable growth."
Ball Corporation is a supplier of metal and plastic packaging products, primarily for the beverage and food industries. The company also owns Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp., which develops sensors, spacecraft, systems and components for government and commercial markets. Ball Corporation employs more than 13,200 people and reported 2004 sales of $5.4 billion.

(a) Per share and share amounts have been retroactively restated for the two-for-one stock split on August 23, 2004.
2.  Free Cash Flow
Management internally uses a free cash flow measure (1) to evaluate the company's operating results, (2) for planning purposes, (3) to evaluate strategic investments and (4) to evaluate the company's ability to incur and service debt. Free cash flow is not a defined term under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (a non-U.S. GAAP measure). Non-U.S. GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
Free cash flow is derived directly from the company's cash flow statements and is defined as cash flows from operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment. Cash flow from operating activities is the most comparable GAAP term to free cash flow and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. Based on our current 2005 forecast, capital spending could somewhat exceed $300 million and full year 2005 free cash flow is tracking in the $225 million range.
