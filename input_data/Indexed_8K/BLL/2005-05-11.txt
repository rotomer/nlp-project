Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
 
On May 9, 2005, Ball Corporation ("Company"), Ball European Holdings, S.a.r.l., Ball Packaging Products Canada Corp., Ball Cayman Limited, the financial institutions in their capacity as Lenders and Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, as administrative agent for the Lenders executed the Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement (the "Amendment") which further amends the credit agreement dated December 19, 2002 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified and in effect from time to time, the "Credit Agreement").
 
The Amendment increases the right to incur certain additional term loans from $300 million to $450 million. The revolving credit facilities would be equivalent to U.S. dollar $450 million as provided for in the Credit Agreement subject to the Amendment. The Amendment provides for a repricing of the revolving credit facilities and term loan tranches to a lower libor rate.
 
The Amendment also modifies existing covenants to create additional flexibility regarding stock and bond repurchases, and increases the amount permitted for certain restricted payments and for foreign accounts receivable securitization and uncommitted credit lines. The Agreement also joins Ball Cayman Limited as a subsidiary borrower and effects certain additional modifications as set out therein. The Amendment is subject to the same terms, including acceleration provisions, as were provided for in the Credit Agreement.
 
The foregoing summary of the changes contained in the Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement is subject in its entirety to the Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement which is attached hereto and filed herewith as Exhibit 99.
