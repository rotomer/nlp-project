Indemnification
Section  A.  Indemnification of Directors and Officers - General.
Certain of the terms used herein are more specifically defined in Section F of this Article Five.
(1)         The corporation shall indemnify an individual made a party to a proceeding because he is or was a director or officer of the corporation against liability incurred in connection with a proceeding to the fullest extent permitted by the Indiana Business Corporation Law (the "IBCL"), as the same now exist or may hereafter be amended (but only to the extent any such amendment permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than the IBCL permitted the corporation to provide prior to such amendment).
(2)        The termination of a proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent is not, of itself, determinative that the director or officer did not meet the standard of conduct set forth in the IBCL.
(3)        To the extent that a director or officer has been wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which he was a party, or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, because he is or was a director or officer of the corporation, the corporation shall indemnify the director or officer against reasonable expenses incurred by him in connection therewith regardless of whether the director or officer has met the standards set forth in the IBCL and without any action or determination under Section D of this Article Five.
(1)         The corporation shall pay for or reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred by a director or officer who is a party to a proceeding in advance of final disposition of the proceeding if:
(a)       The director or officer furnishes the corporation a written affirmation of his good faith belief that he has met the standard of conduct set forth in the IBCL;
(b)       The director or officer furnishes the corporation a written undertaking, executed personally or on his behalf, to repay any advances if it is ultimately determined that he is not entitled to indemnification under this Article Five; and
(c)       A determination is made that the facts then known to those making the determination would not preclude indemnification under the IBCL.
(2)        The undertaking required by paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this Section B must be an unlimited general obligation of the director or officer but need not be secured and may be accepted without reference to financial ability to make repayment.
(1)        The corporation shall not indemnify a director or officer under Section A of this Article Five unless a determination has been made in the specific case that indemnification of the director is permissible in the circumstances because he has met the standard of conduct set forth in the IBCL. Such determination shall be made within 60 days of the request for indemnification:
(a)         By the board of directors by majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;
(b)        If a quorum cannot be obtained under paragraph (a) of this subsection, by majority vote of a committee duly designated by the board of directors (in which designation directors who are parties may participate), consisting solely of two or more directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;
(c)        By special legal counsel:
(i)
              
Selected by the board of directors or its committee in the manner prescribed in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection; or
(ii)
             
If a quorum of the board of directors cannot be obtained under paragraph (a) of this subsection and a committee cannot be designated under paragraph (b) of this subsection, selected by majority vote of the full board of directors (in which selection directors who are parties may participate); or
 
-6-
 
 
(d)        By the shareholders, but the shares owned by or voted under the control of the officers and directors who are at the time parties to the proceeding may not be voted on the determination; provided, however, that following a change of control of the corporation, with respect to all matters thereafter arising out of acts, omissions or events prior to the change of control of the corporation concerning the rights of any person seeking indemnification under this Article Five, such determination shall be made by special legal counsel selected by such person and approved by the board of directors or its committee in the manner described in Section C(1)(c) above (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), which counsel has not otherwise performed services (other than in connection with similar matters) within the five years preceding its engagement to render such opinion for such person or for the corporation or any affiliates (as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) of the corporation (whether or not they were affiliates when services were so performed) ("Independent Counsel"). Unless such person has theretofore selected Independent Counsel pursuant to this Section C and such Independent Counsel has been approved by the corporation, legal counsel approved by a resolution or resolutions of the board of directors of the corporation prior to a change of control of the corporation shall be deemed to have been approved by the corporation as required. Such Independent Counsel shall determine as promptly as practicable whether and to what extent such person would be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law and shall render its written opinion to the corporation and such person to such effect. In making a determination under this Section C, the special legal counsel and Independent Counsel referred to above shall determine that indemnification is permissible unless clearly precluded by this Article Five or the applicable provisions of the IBCL. The corporation agrees to pay the reasonable fees of the Independent Counsel referred to above and to fully indemnify such Independent Counsel against any and all expenses, claims, liabilities and damages arising out of or relating to this Article Five or its engagement pursuant hereto.
(2)        Authorization of indemnification or an obligation to indemnify and evaluation as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made as set forth in paragraph (a) above, except that if the determination is made by special legal counsel (pursuant to Section C(1)(c) above), authorization of indemnification and evaluation as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made by those entitled under Section C(1)(c) above to select counsel.
(3)        Indemnification under this Article Five in connection with a proceeding by or in the right of the corporation shall be limited to reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding.
Section  D.  Enforceability.
The provisions of this Article Five shall be applicable to all proceedings commenced after its adoption, whether such arise out of events, acts, omissions or circumstances which occurred or existed prior or subsequent to such adoption, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such person.

News Release
 
Ball Reports Second Quarter Earnings
 
BROOMFIELD, Colo., July 28, 2005Ball Corporation [NYSE:BLL] today announced second quarter earnings of $79 million, or 71 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.55 billion, compared to $90.7 million, or 80 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.47 billion in the second quarter of 2004.
For the first six months of 2005, Ball's earnings were $137.6 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, on sales of $2.88 billion, compared to $137.5 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, on sales of $2.7 billion in the first half of 2004. The 2005 second quarter and first half results include an after-tax charge of $5.9 million, or five cents per diluted share, related to the closing announced during the quarter of a Canadian food can manufacturing plant.
"Our strong first quarter borrowed a bit from the second quarter," said R. David Hoover, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Through the first six months, our results on a comparable basis are six cents better than the same period last year."
North American Packaging Segment
North American packaging segment earnings for the quarter, before pre-tax plant closing costs of $8.8 million, were $74.9 million on sales of $977 million, compared to $91.4 million on sales of $945.4 million in the second quarter of 2004. For the first six months, earnings, before the $8.8 million plant closing costs, were $153.2 million on sales of $1.82 billion, compared to $158 million on sales of $1.73 billion in the first half of 2004.

"We were generally pleased with our second quarter results, with some exceptions," Hoover said. "As expected, the first quarter performance in food cans resulted in lower second quarter results as our customers worked through inventories they pre-bought. Also, North American 12-ounce beverage can volumes were down from last year, and higher costs for freight, energy and some materials had a negative effect on second quarter segment earnings.
"We also have seen this year the shifts in volumes that occur from time to time in the packaging industry," Hoover said. "We are closing the food can plant in Quebec after exiting some supply positions in the region, but we have gained business in other regions and year-to-date food can volumes are ahead of last year. On the beverage can side, we have experienced some volume loss in 2005 as certain new, long-term contracts were being negotiated. During the second quarter those negotiations resulted in our restoring those volumes for 2006 and beyond.
"The 2005 capital spending program is progressing well in this segment and we expect to earn acceptable returns on those projects once they are complete," Hoover said. "We had a smooth conversion of a line in our Golden, Colo., beverage can plant from the production of 12-ounce cans to the production of 24-ounce cans. The converted line is running well and yesterday we announced plans for a line conversion in our Monticello, Ind., plant."
Hoover said another bright spot in the North American packaging segment was the continued improved performance of plastic container operations. Sales for the first six months are up nearly 25 percent over the first half of 2004, due in part to strong demand for carbonated soft drink and water bottles and increased demand for barrier and heat-set containers that provide longer shelf-life for products, as well as higher resin costs that are passed on to customers.
International Packaging Segment
International packaging segment earnings for the second quarter were $58.2 million on sales of $394.3 million, compared to $62.1 million on sales of $351.5 million in the second quarter of 2004. For the first half of 2005, earnings were $88.5 million on sales of $692.3 million, compared to $89.7 million on sales of $635.3 million during the first six months of 2004. The first half 2005 results include a $3.4 million first quarter charge in China for the full write-off of a minority-owned joint venture.
"International packaging segment performance in the second quarter was somewhat below a year ago while earnings for the first six months were up slightly, excluding the $3.4 million write-off in China," Hoover said.

"In Europe we experienced especially strong volumes in what traditionally is a strong quarter for shipments. Despite few cans being sold in the German market, for the first time since the implementation of the German deposit law, we are running all of our plants in Europe full out, and we are challenged to keep up with the demand that is driven principally by the warm start to the summer. Our new beverage can plant near Belgrade began production during the second quarter after an expedited construction and line startup schedule," Hoover said.
"While the circumstances in Europe have caused near-term costs to be somewhat higher due to lower finished good inventories, higher freight costs and the startup costs associated with our new plant, we expect such costs to moderate as we move through the balance of the year," Hoover said. "If the warm weather holds through the summer, we expect current volume trends to continue.
"In China, we continue to increase volumes and improve our operations and results," Hoover said.
Aerospace and Technologies Segment
Aerospace and technologies segment earnings for the second quarter were $14.9 million on sales of $180.7 million, compared to $12 million on sales of $170.3 million in the second quarter of 2004. For the first half of 2005, earnings were $23.8 million on sales of $362.7 million, compared to $23.2 million on sales of $330.6 million in the first six months of 2004. The first half 2005 results include a $3.8 million first quarter write-down to net realizable value of a small aerospace equity investment.
"The flawless performance of the Deep Impact mission over the July 4
th
weekend was a tremendous way for our aerospace and technologies segment to end the first half of the year and begin the second," Hoover said. "We built the two spacecraft and scientific instruments for this extremely challenging assignment of hitting a comet 83 million miles from Earth with an impactor spacecraft and recording the results of the impact with a flyby spacecraft. The success of the mission is a testament to our capabilities and we intend to build on that success with future scientific and defense missions we have under contract or are pursuing.
"Late in the second quarter we broke ground for an expansion of our aerospace manufacturing center in Westminster, Colo., to help accommodate the growth we have experienced in this segment," Hoover said.

Outlook
"Our first half results, excluding plant closure costs, were up slightly from a year ago, which was sharply higher than the first half of 2003," Hoover said. "We are working hard to do at least as well in the second half of 2005 as we did in the second half of 2004.
"With the rebound in North American beverage container volumes we expect for next year, the improvements resulting from our capital expenditures, and the cost containment programs we regularly develop and refine, we are optimistic about our future prospects," Hoover said. "Also, we continue to see encouraging developments on the German deposit front. Cans are beginning to reappear in some of the major retail chains, and the overall climate for cans has improved. These reintroductions help keep the beverage can before the consuming public until an acceptable nationwide redemption system is in place, hopefully in time for the 2006 World Cup soccer championship in Germany.
"We will continue to look at acquisition opportunities and will remain disciplined in that process," Hoover said. "We have had a lot of success with our recent acquisitions and an important part of that is paying a price that allows us to earn a return in excess of our cost of capital. We do not intend to compete for an acquisition that would result in our paying a price that would not create economic value for our shareholders."
Raymond J. Seabrook, senior vice president and chief financial officer, said the company's full-year capital spending and free cash flow estimates for 2005 are unchanged from the first quarter.
"A project to upgrade and streamline our North American beverage can end manufacturing capabilities is underway," Seabrook said. "This project will result in significant productivity improvements and cost reductions. A predominantly non-cash accounting charge in the range of $20 million after tax associated with obsolescing equipment and employee costs will be made when the overall project plan is completed later this year."
Seabrook said the company purchased more than $175 million worth of its common stock in the second quarter, and that he now expects the total to be repurchased in calendar year 2005 will exceed $200 million.

"We also expect to begin the repatriation of more than $500 million in foreign earnings and capital in the third quarter. The $16 million cash tax cost associated with the repatriation will not increase the effective tax rate as it will be more than offset by taxes provided on the foreign earnings in prior years," Seabrook said. "The funds will be reinvested for uses permitted under the tax laws."

2.  Business Consolidation Activities
In the second quarter of 2005, Ball announced its plan to close its Baie d' Urfe metal food container plant in Canada. In connection with the closure, the company recorded a charge of $8.8 million ($5.9 million after tax). A summary of the effects of the above transaction on after-tax earnings follows:
Ball's management segregates the above items related to closed facilities to evaluate the company's performance of current operations. The above is presented on a non-U.S. GAAP basis and should be considered in connection with the unaudited statement of consolidated earnings. Non-U.S. GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation.
3.  Free Cash Flow
Management internally uses a free cash flow measure (1) to evaluate the company's operating results, (2) for planning purposes, (3) to evaluate strategic investments and (4) to evaluate the company's ability to incur and service debt. Free cash flow is not a defined term under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (a non-U.S. GAAP measure). Non-U.S. GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
Free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company's cash flow statements and defined as cash flows from operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment; however it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods. Cash flow from operating activities is the most comparable GAAP term to free cash flow and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures.
Based on our current 2005 capital spending forecast $300 million, our projected 2005 free cash flow should be in the $225 million range.
