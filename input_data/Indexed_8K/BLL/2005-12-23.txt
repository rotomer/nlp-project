Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
On December 23, 2005, the Human Resources Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors (the Board) of Ball Corporation (the Company) took the following actions:
The Committee adopted and approved the Ball Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan effective January 1, 2005. The purpose of the plan is to continue to provide Participants with an opportunity to defer receipt of a portion of their salary, bonus or other specified cash compensation in compliance with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and take advantage of certain transition opportunities presented in Notice 2005-1 and reaffirmed in the proposed regulations published on October 4, 2005. Participants under the plan shall be eligible employees employed by the Company or its subsidiaries who can elect to defer compensation in accordance with the plan, as well as Company Awards, which may be a match made by the Company from time to time to the account of a Participant. The deferral of compensation may be invested by means of a conversion of a dollar amount of deferred compensation and Company Awards credited to Participants deferred compensation accounts and to measure shares or units of ownership of a security (e.g., mutual fund, company stock or other investment) which is referred to by the investment options selected by the Participant. The conversion shall occur as if shares or units of the designated investment were being purchased or sold (in the case of distribution) at the purchase price as of the close of business the day on which the deemed investment occurs. There is no real or beneficial ownership of any security pursuant to any investment option. Distributions may be made in accordance with the plan, at the Participants election, either in a lump sum or equal annual installments from two to 15 years, or combination thereof. The Ball Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 to this current report on Form 8-K.
The Committee adopted and approved the Ball Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Company Stock Plan effective January 1, 2005. The purpose of the plan is to continue to provide Participants (eligible employees of the Company or its subsidiaries as well as directors of the Company) with an opportunity to defer receipt of a portion of their salary, bonus or other specified cash compensation in compliance with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and take advantage of certain transition opportunities presented in Notice 2005-1 and reaffirmed in the proposed regulations published on October 4, 2005. Deferrals shall be made to Participants accounts and include Company Awards, any Company matching contributions, return on units, payments and such other transactions that may be required to properly administer the plan. The value of each deferred compensation account shall be based on the value of the Companys common stock. The value of such deferred compensation account shall be determined by multiplying the number of units by the value of one share of Company stock on the New York Stock Exchange composite listing on the applicable payment date. Participants may elect distributions in accordance with the plan either in a lump sum or in annual installments
from two to 15 years, or combination thereof. The Ball Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Company Stock Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 to this current report on Form 8-K.
 
The Committee adopted and approved the Ball Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors effective January 1, 2005. The purpose of the plan is to continue to provide Participants (non-management directors of the Company) with an opportunity to defer receipt of a part or all their cash portion of their annual incentive retainers, fees and other cash compensation in compliance with the Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and to take advantage of certain transition opportunities presented in Notice 2005-1 and reaffirmed in the proposed regulations published on October 4, 2005. The deferral of compensation may be invested by means of a conversion of a dollar amount of deferred compensation and Company Awards credited to Participants deferred compensation accounts and to measure shares or units of ownership of a security (e.g., mutual fund, company stock or other investment) which is referred to by the investment options selected by the Participant. The conversion shall occur as if shares or units of the designated investment were being purchased or sold (in the case of distribution) at the purchase price as of the close of business the day on which the deemed investment occurs. There is no real or beneficial ownership of any security pursuant to any investment option. Participants may elect distributions in accordance with the plan in either a lump sum or in annual installments from two to 15 years, or combination thereof. The Ball Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.3 to this current report on Form 8-K.
The foregoing summary of some of the general provisions of the Ball Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan, the Ball Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Company Stock Plan and the Ball Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to each of the plans, which are filed as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 to this current report on Form 8-K.

Establishment and Purpose

Effective January 1, 2005 the Company hereby adopts the Ball Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan (the 2005 Plan or the Plan). The purpose of the Plan is to continue to provide Participants with an opportunity to defer receipt of a portion of their salary, bonus and other specified cash compensation in compliance with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.

The Plan is not intended to meet the qualification requirements of Code Section 401(a), but is intended to meet the requirements Code Section 409A, and to be an unfunded arrangement providing deferred compensation to eligible employees who are part of a select group of management or highly compensated employees of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, within the meaning of Sections 201, 301 and 401 of ERISA. The Plan is intended to be exempt from the requirements of Parts 2, 3 and 4 of Title I of ERISA as a "top hat" plan, and to be eligible for the alternative method of compliance for reporting and disclosure available for unfunded "top hat" plans.
Article II
Definitions
 
 
 
The provisions of this Plan shall apply only to such Accounts and shall not apply to any Grandfathered Plan accounts.
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to the provisions of Section 3.3, the Plan Administrator may modify a Participants Compensation Deferral Agreement at any time to conform the Compensation Deferral Agreement and the Plan to applicable law. The Compensation Deferral Agreement will consist of an agreement prepared under the authority of the Plan Administrator which may be modified from time to time, consistent with the material terms of the Plan and the Plan Administrators authority as delegated by the HR Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. A completed Compensation Deferral Agreement, and any modifications thereto authorized under the Plan, may be submitted to the Plan Administrator in paper or electronic form, under procedures prescribed by the Plan Administrator.
 
 
 
a.
 
Separation Accounts.
A Participant may elect in a Compensation Deferral Agreement that establishes a Separation Account the number of years following Separation from Service when payment will be made from the Account (e.g., Third year following Separation from Service). The Payment Date is January 1 of such year. If no Payment Date is designated, the Payment Date is January 1 of the year following the year in which the Participant has a Separation from Service.
b.
 
Specified Date Accounts.
The Payment Date for a Specified Date Account is January 1 of the year specified for such Account.
 
 
 
c.
 
Separation Prior to Age 55.
In the event a Participant Separates from Service prior to attaining age 55, the Payment Date for all Accounts is January 1 of the year following the year in which the Separation from Service occurred.
d.
 
Death.
In the event of the Participants death, the Payment Date for payments to Beneficiaries is January 1 of the year following the year in which the Participant died.
e.
 
Deferred Disability Benefit.
A Participant entitled to a Deferred Disability Benefit will receive payment commencing January 1 of the year following the year in which the Participant attains age 65.
f.
 
Administration.
Pursuant to Code Section 409A, payment will be treated as made upon the applicable Payment Date if the payment is made by the later of the first date it is administratively feasible to do so after such Payment Date or the end of the calendar year containing such Payment Date. The Plan Administrator shall adopt such administrative procedures as are necessary to reasonably ensure that payments scheduled for January 1 of a given year will be made after January 1 of such year and before February 15 of such year.
In addition, to facilitate administration of the Plan, all Participants shall be treated as specified employees as defined in Code Section 409A. Accordingly,
if a Payment Date occurs in the year following a Separation from Service, payment will be made as follows:
A Participant may elect to receive a Separation Account or Specified Date Account (a) in a lump sum from 0% to 100% of the Account Balance, and (b) the balance, if any, in annual installments from two (2) to fifteen (15) years. If the lump sum is less than 100%, then (i) the lump sum and (ii) the series of annual installments will each be treated as separate Payment Schedules for purposes of the payment modification provisions of Section 4.6c.
All Accounts will be paid to a Participant who Separates from Service prior to attaining age 55 in a single lump sum, regardless of any other Payment Schedule that may be in effect for the Accounts.
 
 
 
A Death Distribution will be paid from each Account pursuant to the Payment Schedule in effect for each such Account.
A Deferred Disability Benefit will be paid in a single lump sum.
Notwithstanding any Payment Schedule elected by a Participant, distributions shall not be made in such a manner as to cause the acceleration of a payment in violation of Code Section 409A. The Plan Administrator retains the authority to determine when and to what extent a payment option, unless modified, would result in acceleration of a payment and to make corresponding adjustments to the Participants Payment Schedule to avoid an impermissible acceleration.
 
 
 
Article III
Eligibility and Participation
 
     A Participant who is an Eligible Employee at the time he or she is placed on a disability leave of absence in accordance with the Companys policies and procedures shall continue to be a Participant eligible to receive Company Awards under Section 5.3 during such leave of absence.
   
     A Participant who is no longer an Eligible Employee but continues to be employed by the Company may not defer Compensation but may otherwise exercise all of the rights of a Participant under the Plan with respect to his or her Deferred Compensation Account. On and after a Separation from Service, a Participant shall remain a Participant as long as his or her Compensation Deferral Account is greater than zero and during such time may continue to make Allocation Elections. An individual shall cease participation in the Plan when all benefits under the Plan to which he or she is entitled have been paid.
   
 
 
 
Article IV
Deferral Elections
Eligible Employees who became Employees after January 1 of the calendar year may defer an annual incentive award for such calendar year. The election will be deemed to apply to services after the election if the maximum deferral is no greater than the
portion of the Compensation equal to the total amount of the Compensation for the service period multiplied by the ratio of the number of days remaining in the performance period after the election over the total number of days in the performance period.

Such Compensation Deferral Agreement shall constitute the initial deferral election with respect to the Payment Schedule applicable to the Participants Separation and/or Specified Date Accounts established under such Compensation Deferral Agreement.
 
 
 
d.   
Automatic Renewals
.
 
The Plan Administrator may, in its discretion, provide for automatically renewable Compensation Deferral Agreements. An automatically renewable Compensation Deferral Agreement deferring annual incentive awards and other Compensation permitted by the Plan Administrator will remain in effect for all future calendar years and performance periods unless modified or revoked during the applicable enrollment period specified in a. through c. above.
An election to defer Compensation after the 30-day period described above may be filed no later than a date that is twelve (12) months prior to the date on which such award or portion thereof is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (the vesting date), provided that the payment under the Compensation Deferral Agreement occurs no earlier than five (5) years after the vesting date.
 
 
 
In the case of a Separation from Service prior to the date the Participant attains age 55, all Separation Accounts will be paid as of the Payment Date specified in Section 2.25 in the form of a single lump sum.
 
 
 
In the case of a Separation from Service on or after a Participant attains age 55, payment will be made as of the Payment Date and under the Payment Schedule designated by the Participant. The Participant may designate the Payment Date and Payment Schedule for a Separation Account no later than the applicable submission deadline described in Section 4.2 for the Compensation Deferral Agreement that establishes such Separation Account. If no Payment Date is specified, the Payment Date is the date specified in Section 2.25. If no Payment Schedule is specified, payment shall be made in a single lump sum.
Deferrals that are not allocated to a Separation Account or Specified Date Account under the terms of a Deferred Compensation Agreement will be allocated to the Separation Account with the earliest Payment Date. If a Participant has more than one Separation Account with the same Payment Date, the allocation will be made to the Separation Account with the shortest Payment Schedule. The determination of the Payment Date and Payment Schedules for purposes of this paragraph shall be determined at the time the Compensation Deferral Agreement authorizing the Deferral was filed with the Plan Administrator. If a Separation Account has not been established, the Administrator shall establish a Separation Account payable as of the Payment Date specified in 2.25 and payable in a single lump sum.
The Participant must designate a Payment Date and Payment Schedule for each Specified Date Account no later than the applicable submission deadline described in Section 4.2 for the Deferred Compensation Agreement that establishes the Specified Date Account. If a Payment Date is not specified, the Specified Date Account will be converted to a Separation Account and such Account will be paid in a single lump sum as of the Payment Date specified in Section 2.25.
 
 
 
Modification elections filed pursuant to this paragraph d. shall be subject to the following rules. A modification to a Payment Date scheduled in 2005 or 2006 must be filed prior to the scheduled Payment Date and no later than December 31, 2005. A modification to a Payment Date scheduled in 2007 or later must be filed no later than December 31, 2006. A modification filed on or after January 1, 2006 may not accelerate a payment from a later year into 2006. Subject to the foregoing limitations, the Plan Administrator has the authority to prescribe the time, manner and scope of any election to modify a Payment Date or Payment Schedule under the terms of this paragraph.

The purpose of the Plan is to continue to provide Participants with an opportunity to defer receipt of annual incentive awards and other compensation in compliance with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.
In addition, proposed Treasury regulations published on October 4, 2005 require the Company to adopt written amendments prior to December 31, 2005 with respect to items of transition relief described in Notice 2005-1 that expire on December 31, 2005. This Plan document is intended to satisfy the amendment requirements of the proposed regulations without the amendment constituting a material modification to the Grandfathered Plans. The Company expects to review and restate the Plan in 2006 in accordance with the extended transition relief deadlines set forth in the proposed regulations.
The Plan is not intended to meet the qualification requirements of Code Section 401(a), but is intended to meet the requirements Code Section 409A, and to be an unfunded arrangement providing deferred compensation to Directors and eligible employees who are part of a select group of management or highly compensated employees of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, within the meaning of Sections 201, 301 and 401 of ERISA. The Plan is intended to be exempt from the requirements of Parts 2, 3 and 4 of Title I of ERISA as a "top hat" plan, and to be eligible for the alternative method of compliance for reporting and disclosure available for unfunded "top hat" plans.
The Plan is further intended (1) to assist the Company in attracting and retaining key employees by providing a non-qualified deferred compensation vehicle that also increases the interest of such key employees in the Company Stock performance, and (2) to establish an alternative method of compensating those Directors of the Company who do not receive compensation as employees of the Company in a way that increases the interest of such Directors in the Company Stock performance.

to determine the amount of benefits payable to a Participant or Beneficiary in accordance with the form of payment and timing requirements specified in the Participants Compensation Deferral Agreements and subject to the terms of the Plan. The Account shall not constitute or be treated as an escrow, trust fund, or any other type of funded account for Code or ERISA purposes and amounts credited thereto shall not be considered plan assets for federal income tax or ERISA purposes. Accounts under this Plan shall reflect only those amounts considered to be Deferrals as defined in this Plan. The provisions of this Plan shall apply only to such Accounts and shall not apply to any Grandfathered Plan accounts.
2
Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to the provisions of Section 3.3, the Plan Administrator may modify a Participants Compensation Deferral Agreement at any time to conform the Compensation Deferral Agreement and the Plan to applicable law. The Compensation Deferral Agreement will consist of an agreement prepared under the authority of the Plan Administrator which may be modified from time to time, consistent with the material terms of the Plan and the Plan Administrators authority as delegated by the HR Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. A completed Compensation Deferral Agreement, and any modifications thereto authorized under the Plan, may be submitted to the Plan Administrator in paper or electronic form, under procedures prescribed by the Plan Administrator.

The Payment Date is deemed to be January 1 of such year. If no Payment Date is designated, the Payment Date is January 1 of the year following the year in which the Participant Separates from Service.
b

d.
  
   
Administration.
Pursuant to Code Section 409A, payment will be treated as made upon the applicable Payment Date if the payment is made by the later of the first date it is administratively feasible to do so after such Payment Date or the end of the calendar year containing such Payment Date. The Plan Administrator shall adopt such administrative procedures as are necessary to reasonably ensure that payments scheduled for January 1 of a given year will be made after January 1 of such year and before February 15 of such year.
In addition, to facilitate administration of the Plan, all Participants shall be treated as specified employees as defined in Code Section 409A. Accordingly,

A Participant may elect to receive a Separation Account (a) in a lump sum from 0% to 100% of the Account Balance, and (b) the balance, if any, in annual installments from two (2) to fifteen (15) years. If the lump sum is less than 100%, then (i) the lump sum and (ii) the series of annual installments will each be treated as separate Payment Schedules for purposes of the payment modification provisions of Section 4.5c.
All Accounts will be paid in a single lump sum to an Employee Participant who Separates from Service prior to attaining age 55, regardless of any other Payment Schedule that may be in effect for the Accounts.
A Death Distribution will be paid from each Account pursuant to the Payment Schedule in effect for each such Account.
Notwithstanding any Payment Schedule elected by a Participant, distributions shall not be made in such a manner as to cause the acceleration of a payment in violation of Code Section 409A.

If there is any change in the number or class of shares of Company Stock through the declaration of a stock dividend or other extraordinary dividends, or recapitalization resulting in stock splits, or combinations or exchanges of such shares or in the event of similar corporate transactions, the Units in each Participants Deferred Compensation Account shall be equitably adjusted to reflect any such change in the number or class of issued shares of Company Stock or to reflect such similar corporate transaction.
Article III

On and after a Separation from Service, a Participant shall remain a Participant as long as his or her Compensation Deferral Account is greater than zero. An individual shall cease participation in the Plan when all benefits under the Plan to which he or she is entitled have been paid.

Article I
Establishment and Purpose
Ball Corporation (the Company) has maintained and will continue to maintain the Ball Corporation 2001 Deferred Compensation Plan, the Ball Corporation 2000 Deferred Compensation Company Stock Plan, and the Ball Corporation 2002 Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors (the Grandfathered Plans).
Effective January 1, 2005 the Company hereby adopts the Ball Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors (the Plan). The purpose of the Plan is to continue to provide Participants with an opportunity to defer receipt of part or all of the cash portion of annual incentive retainers, fees and other cash compensation in compliance with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.
In addition, proposed Treasury regulations published on October 4, 2005 require the Company to adopt written amendments prior to December 31, 2005 with respect to items of transition relief described in Notice 2005-1 that expire on December 31, 2005. This Plan document is intended to satisfy the amendment requirements of the proposed regulations without the amendment constituting a material modification to the Grandfathered Plans. The Company expects to review and restate the Plan in 2006 in accordance with the extended transition relief deadlines set forth in the proposed regulations.
The Plan is not intended to meet the qualification requirements of Code Section 401(a), but is intended to meet the requirements of Code Section 409A, and to be an unfunded arrangement providing deferred compensation to Directors of the Company. The Plan is intended to be exempt from the requirements of Parts 2, 3 and 4 of Title I of ERISA as a "top hat" plan, and to be eligible for the alternative method of compliance for reporting and disclosure available for unfunded "top hat" plans.
Article II
Definitions
credited with deferrals under the Agreement, (d) specifies the Payment Dates for each such Account and (e) specifies a Payment Schedule with respect to payments from each such Account. A Compensation Deferral Agreement is effective (and irrevocable, subject to the provisions of the Plan) with respect to a service period or Company Contribution as of the first day following the election period specified in Article IV or as provided under Treasury Department regulations. A Compensation Deferral Agreement remains in effect until modified in accordance with the Plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to the provisions of Section 3.3, the Plan Administrator may modify a Participants Compensation Deferral Agreement at any time to conform the Compensation Deferral Agreement and the Plan to applicable law. The Compensation Deferral Agreement will consist of an agreement prepared under the authority of the Plan Administrator which may be modified from time to time, consistent with the material terms of the Plan and the Plan Administrators authority as delegated by the HR Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. A completed Compensation Deferral Agreement, and any modifications thereto authorized under the Plan, may be submitted to the Plan Administrator in paper or electronic form, under procedures prescribed by the Plan Administrator.
a.
  
   
Separation Accounts.
A Participant may elect in a Compensation Deferral Agreement that establishes a Separation Account the number of years following Separation from Service when payment will be made from the Account (e.g., Third year following Separation from Service). The Payment Date is deemed to be January 1 of such year. If no Payment Date is designated, the Payment Date is January 1 of the year following the year in which the Participant Separates from Service.
b.
  
   
Specified Date Accounts.
The Payment Date for a Specified Date Account is January 1 of the year specified for such Account.
c
.
 
 Death.
   
In the event of the Participants death, the Payment Date for payments to Beneficiaries is January 1 of the year following the year in which the Participant died.
d.
 
 Administration.
   
Pursuant to Code Section 409A, payment will be treated as made upon the applicable Payment Date if the payment is made by the later of the first date it is administratively feasible to do so after such Payment Date or the end of the calendar year containing such Payment Date. The Plan Administrator shall adopt such administrative procedures as are necessary to reasonably ensure that payments scheduled for January 1 of a given year will be made after January 1 of such year and before February 15 of such year.
A Participant may elect to receive a Separation Account or Specified Date Account (a) in a lump sum from 0% to 100% of the Account Balance, and (b) the balance, if any, in annual installments from two (2) to fifteen (15) years. If the lump sum is less than 100%,
then (i) the lump sum and (ii) the series of annual installments will each be treated as separate Payment Schedules for purposes of the payment modification provisions of Section 4.6c.
A Death Distribution will be paid from each Account pursuant to the Payment Schedule in effect for each such Account.
Notwithstanding any Payment Schedule elected by a Participant, distributions shall not be made in such a manner as to cause the acceleration of a payment in violation of Code Section 409A. The Plan Administrator retains the authority to determine when and to what extent a payment option, unless modified, would result in acceleration of a payment and to make corresponding adjustments to the Participants Payment Schedule to avoid an impermissible acceleration.
Article III
Eligibility and Participation
Article IV
Deferral Elections
Individuals who became Directors after January 1 of the calendar year may defer the non-equity portion of any annual incentive retainer for such calendar year. The election will be deemed to apply to services after the election if the maximum deferral is no greater than the
portion of the Compensation equal to the total amount of the Compensation for the service period multiplied by the ratio of the number of days remaining in the performance period after the election over the total number of days in the performance period.
If a Director does not submit a Compensation Deferral Agreement within the first 30 days of his or her eligibility to participate in the Plan, such Director may submit a Compensation Deferral Agreement at such other times as are specified in this Plan. Such Compensation Deferral Agreement shall constitute the initial deferral election with respect to any Separation Accounts and Specified Date Accounts established under such election.
An election to defer Compensation after the 30-day period described above may be filed no later than a date that is twelve (12) months prior to the date on which such award or portion thereof is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (the vesting date), provided that the payment under the Compensation Deferral Agreement occurs no earlier than five (5) years after the vesting date.
Payment will be made from a Separation Account as of the Payment Date and under the Payment Schedule designated by the Participant. The Participant may designate the Payment Date and Payment Schedule for a Separation Account no later than the applicable submission deadline described in Section 4.2 for the Compensation Deferral Agreement that establishes such Separation Account. If no Payment Date is specified, the Payment Date is the date specified in Section 2.22. If no Payment Schedule is specified, payment shall be made in a single lump sum.
Deferrals that are not allocated to a Separation Account or Specified Date Account under the terms of a Deferred Compensation Agreement will be allocated to the Separation Account with the earliest Payment Date. If a Participant has more than one Separation Account with the same Payment Date, the allocation will be made to the Separation Account with the shortest Payment Schedule. The determination of the Payment Date and Payment Schedules for purposes of this paragraph shall be determined at the time the Compensation Deferral Agreement authorizing the Deferral was filed with the Plan Administrator. If a Separation Account has not been established, the Administrator shall establish a Separation Account payable on January 1 of the year following Separation from Service and shall be payable in a single lump sum.
The Participant must designate a Payment Date and Payment Schedule for each Specified Date Account no later than the applicable submission deadline described in Section 4.2 for the Deferred Compensation Agreement that establishes the Specified Date Account. If a Payment Date is not specified, the Specified Date Account will be converted to a Separation Account and such Account will be paid in a single lump sum payable as of the January 1 following the date the Participant incurs a Separation from Service.
Modification elections filed pursuant to this paragraph d. shall be subject to the following rules. A modification to a Payment Date scheduled in 2005 or 2006 must be filed prior to the scheduled Payment Date and no later than December 31, 2005. A modification to a Payment Date scheduled in 2007 or later must be filed no later than December 31, 2006. A modification filed on or after January 1, 2006 may not accelerate a payment from a later year into 2006. Subject to the foregoing limitations, the Plan Administrator has the authority to prescribe the time, manner and scope of any election to modify a Payment Date or Payment Schedule under the terms of this paragraph.
