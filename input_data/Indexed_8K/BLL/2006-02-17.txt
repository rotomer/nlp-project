Purchase Price
); provided, that Parent shall set aside shares of Parent Common Stock in an amount equal to $20,000,000 (the 
Held Back Consideration
) from the amount of Merger Consideration that each Securityholder is entitled to receive, in each case in the amount set forth opposite each such Securityholders name on Schedule I hereto under the columns headed Held Back Shares. The Held Back Consideration shall be deposited at Closing with an escrow agent to be mutually agreed upon by the Company and Parent (the

) and be held and released to the Securityholders or Parent, as applicable, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the escrow agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit B
, with such changes as may be reasonably required by the Escrow Agent (the 
Escrow Agreement
). For all purposes under this Agreement (including this Section 2.3(a), and Section 9.5(b)) and the Escrow Agreement, each Held Back Share shall be deemed to have a value equal to the average of the closing prices of Parent Common Stock for the ten (10) trading days ending on the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date, to be adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, recapitalizations or the like with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock (the 
Share Price
).
 
(b)
 
At the Effective Time, Parent, subject to receiving such Securityholders Certificates (as defined below) surrendered in accordance with Section 2.3(c), shall (i) pay to each Securityholder an amount of cash payable in respect of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.6, which amount shall be set forth opposite such Securityholders name on Schedule I hereto under the column headed Aggregate Fractional Share Closing Payment and (ii) deliver to each Securityholder a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock, registered in such names and in such denominations as the Securityholders Representative (as defined below) shall request in writing not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, equal to the number of shares set forth opposite such Securityholders name on Schedule I hereto under the column headed Aggregate Closing Stock.
 
(c)
 
At the Effective Time, each holder of a Preferred Share shall surrender the applicable certificate(s) (each, a 
Certificate
) representing such shares and in exchange therefor shall be entitled to receive the amount of shares of Parent Common Stock and the amount, if any, of cash payable in respect of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.6 to which such Securityholder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1 and Schedule I and such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable in
5
respect of fractional shares upon the surrender of such Certificates. If payment is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name such Certificate surrendered is registered, it may be a condition of payment that such Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate surrendered of the applicable Merger Consideration, or that such person shall establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.3, each Certificate evidencing a Preferred Share shall represent, for all purposes, only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and Schedule I hereto.
 
(d)
 
At the Effective Time, Parent shall surrender the certificate(s) representing the Newco Shares and the Surviving Corporation shall issue to Parent in exchange therefor a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock to which Parent is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(d).

No Transfer of Shares After the Effective Time
. No transfers of Company Shares or Preferred Shares shall be made on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation at or after the Effective Time.
 
Section 2.5
 
Lost Certificates
. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person (who shall be the record owner of such Certificate) claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Securityholders Representative will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.
 
Section 2.6
 
No Fractional Shares
. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or Surviving Corporation Common Stock will be issued and any person entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock or Surviving Corporation Common Stock, as applicable, but for this Section 2.6 shall be entitled to receive in lieu thereof an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying such fraction (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a share) by the Share Price.
 
Section 2.7
 
Adjustments to Prevent Dilution
. In the event that prior to the Effective Time, solely as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse split), or stock dividend or stock distribution, made on a pro rata basis to all holders of such class of stock of the entity making such a stock dividend or stock distribution, there is a change in the number of Preferred Shares or shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding, then the applicable Merger Consideration to which a person is entitled shall be equitably adjusted to eliminate the effects of such event.

Section 2.8
 
.
Certain Adjustments
 
(a)
 
No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the scheduled Closing Date, the Securityholders Representative shall prepare and deliver to Parent an unaudited consolidated balance sheet for the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries (after giving effect to the Spin-Off) as of the scheduled Closing Date (the 
Estimated Balance Sheet
). The Estimated Balance Sheet shall include a calculation of Working Capital (as defined below) and Net Debt (as defined below). The Estimated Balance Sheet shall be prepared in conformity with GAAP (as defined below). Upon Parents receipt of the Estimated Balance Sheet, the parties shall cooperate in developing and agreeing to a final Estimated Balance Sheet.
 
(b)
 
As soon as practicable, but in no event later than forty-five (45) days following the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Securityholders Representative an unaudited consolidated balance sheet for the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries as of the Closing (after giving effect to the Spin-Off) (the 
Closing Balance Sheet
). The Closing Balance Sheet shall include a calculation of Net Debt and Working Capital. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in conformity with GAAP and in accordance with this Section 2.8.
 
(c)
 
After receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Securityholders Representative shall have fifteen (15) days to review it, including the calculations of Net Debt and Working Capital. During the review of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Securityholders Representative and its authorized representatives shall have reasonable access to all relevant books and records and employees of the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Corporations accountants to the extent required to complete the review of the Closing Balance Sheet. Unless the Securityholders Representative delivers written notice to Parent on or prior to the fifteenth (15
th
) day after receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet specifying in reasonable detail its objections to the Closing Balance Sheet, the parties shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the Closing Balance Sheet. If the Securityholders Representative so notifies Parent of such an objection to the Closing Balance Sheet, including to the calculations of Net Debt and Working Capital, the parties shall within thirty (30) days following the date of such notice (the 
Resolution Period
) attempt to resolve their differences. Any resolution by them as to any disputed amount shall be final, binding, conclusive and nonappealable,
provided
,
however
, that agreement by the Securityholders Representative and Parent as to the Final Closing Balance Sheet (as defined below) or a determination pursuant to Section 2.8(d) shall not prevent either party from making any claims under Article IX hereof. The term 
Final Closing Balance Sheet
 shall mean the definitive Closing Balance Sheet (which includes the calculations of Net Debt and Working Capital) agreed to by the Securityholders Representative and Parent in accordance with this Section 2.8(c) or the definitive Closing Balance Sheet resulting from the determination made by the Neutral Auditor in accordance with Section 2.8(d) (in addition to those items theretofore agreed to by the Securityholders Representative and Parent).
 
(d)
 
If at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, the parties have not resolved the disputes, then all amounts remaining in dispute shall, at the election of either party,
7
be submitted to an auditor who shall be selected by Parent and the Securityholders Representative (the 
Neutral Auditor
). The Neutral Auditor shall be engaged no later than three (3) Business Days after an election by either party to submit its objections to the Neutral Auditor, and each party agrees to execute, if requested by the Neutral Auditor, a reasonable engagement letter. The Neutral Auditor shall be a nationally recognized certified public accounting firm that is not rendering (and during the preceding two (2) year period has not rendered) audit services, other than pension-related audit services, to either the Company, the Securityholders Representative or Parent in North America. If the parties are unable to agree on such Neutral Auditor, then the respective accounting firms of each of Parent and the Securityholders Representative shall choose the Neutral Auditor. All fees and expenses of the Neutral Auditor shall be borne equally by the Securityholders and Parent. The Neutral Auditor shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based solely on the presentations by the Securityholders Representative and Parent, and not by independent review, only those issues still in dispute. The Neutral Auditors determination shall be made within thirty (30) days of its engagement or as soon thereafter as possible, shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to the Securityholders Representative and Parent and shall be final, binding, conclusive and nonappealable.
 
(e)
 
The Purchase Price payable at the Closing shall be (i) increased to the extent the Net Debt as reflected on the Estimated Balance Sheet (the 
Estimated Net Debt
) is less than $550,000,000 (the 
Maximum Net Debt Amount
) or (ii) decreased to the extent the Estimated Net Debt is greater than the Maximum Net Debt Amount. The number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be added to or subtracted from, as applicable, the Purchase Price deliverable at the Closing pursuant to the preceding sentence in the event the Estimated Net Debt is less than or greater than, as applicable, the Maximum Net Debt Amount shall be that number of shares obtained by dividing (x) the amount by which the Estimated Net Debt is less than or greater than, as applicable, the Maximum Net Debt Amount by (y) the Share Price.
 
(f)
 
If Net Debt as reflected on the Final Closing Balance Sheet is greater than the Estimated Net Debt (the 
Net Debt Excess Amount
), the Securityholders shall pay such Net Debt Excess Amount to the Surviving Corporation. If Net Debt as reflected on the Final Closing Balance Sheet is less than the Estimated Net Debt (the 
Net Debt Shortfall Amount
), the Surviving Corporation shall pay such Net Debt Shortfall Amount to the Securityholders. 
Net Debt
 means the excess of all outstanding third party indebtedness less the sum of all cash and cash equivalents on hand.
 
(g)
 
The Purchase Price payable at the Closing shall be (i) increased to the extent the Working Capital as reflected on the Estimated Balance Sheet (the 
Estimated Working Capital
) is greater than $46,500,000 (the 
Required Working Capital Amount
) or (ii) decreased to the extent the Estimated Working Capital is less than the Required Working Capital Amount. The number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be added to or subtracted from, as applicable, the Purchase Price deliverable at the Closing pursuant to the preceding sentence in the event the Estimated Working Capital is greater than or less than, as applicable, the Required Working Capital Amount shall be that number of shares obtained by dividing (x) the amount by
8
which the Estimated Working Capital is greater than or less than, as applicable, the Required Working Capital Amount by (y) the Share Price.
 
(h)
 
If the Working Capital of the Company as reflected on the Final Closing Balance Sheet is less than the Estimated Working Capital (the 
Working Capital Shortfall
), the Securityholders shall pay such Working Capital Shortfall to the Surviving Corporation. If the Working Capital of the Company as reflected on the Final Closing Balance Sheet is greater than the Estimated Working Capital (the 
Working Capital Excess
), the Surviving Corporation shall pay such Working Capital Excess to the Securityholders. 
Working Capital
 means the sum of trade accounts receivable, other non-trade receivables, inventories and other current assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents and pre-paid income taxes) less trade accounts payable, accrued expenses (including Expenses (as defined below) of the Company, any of its subsidiaries and the Securityholders that are accrued as of the Closing, but excluding restructuring reserves), allowance for doubtful accounts and reserves for obsolete inventory, all determined in conformity with GAAP and in accordance with this Section 2.8. For the avoidance of doubt, determination of Working Capital shall not include or reflect any assets or liabilities of Formametal.
 
(i)
 
All inventory reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet shall be based upon a physical count of the inventory taken by the Company (with Parent, the Securityholders Representative and their respective representatives being permitted to observe such count and take additional test counts as Parent or the Securityholders Representative reasonably deems appropriate) as of mutually agreed times on the Closing Date. Such physical inventory shall be conducted in accordance with procedures to be mutually agreed and shall be taken at the Closing Date. The physical inventory shall include all products of the Company and list the type and quantity of the inventory as of the date the physical count was taken. For purposes of the Closing Balance Sheet, the inventory shall consist of finished goods, work-in-process and raw materials (which are either currently used in production of products or are products currently offered for sale by the Company). In connection with the physical inventory and the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet, a provision for obsolete and unsaleable inventory will be determined and included in the Closing Balance Sheet to reflect physical inventory of the Company that is not saleable.
 
(j)
 
From and after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts, but in no event efforts less diligent than those customarily used by the Company in the collection of its accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business prior to the Closing, to collect the full amount of the accounts receivable set forth on Schedule 2.8(j) (the 
Subject Receivable
) during the period prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the 
Collection Period
). During the Collection Period, all amounts received in respect of the Subject Receivable or other receivables in respect of this customer (other than amounts paid on a cash on delivery basis) shall first be applied to the Subject Receivable. If, upon the expiration of the Collection Period, the Subject Receivable remains uncollected in whole or in part, the Surviving Corporation shall have the option (but not the obligation) to sell, assign and transfer any or all of such uncollected Subject Receivable to the Securityholders Representative
9
on behalf of the Securityholders. The Surviving Corporation shall have until the date that is 15 business days after the expiration of the Collection Period to exercise such option (the date of exercise, if any, the 
Option Date
), which option may be exercised by delivery to the Securityholders Representative of written notice specifying the aggregate amounts collected prior to the Option Date in respect of the Subject Receivable, together with documentation sufficient to convey ownership of the Subject Receivable to the Securityholders on the Option Date. Within five (5) Business Days after the Securityholders Representatives receipt of such notice and documentation, the Securityholders Representative shall pay to the Surviving Corporation on its own behalf and on behalf of the other Securityholders an amount equal to the amount of the Subject Receivable that is uncollected as of the Option Date.
 
(k)
 
Any payments to be made to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Section 2.8 shall be made as provided in Section 9.5(b).
 
Section 2.9

Parent Financing
 
(a)
 
The Company shall provide, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and Company Representatives to provide, at Parents cost, all reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of any financing to be obtained by Parent, Newco or the Surviving Corporation in connection with the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the 
Financing

Nothing herein shall imply that the completion of any such syndication, securities offerings or other financing is a condition to the obligation of Parent and Newco to consummate the Merger. Nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent that it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or otherwise result in unreasonable interference with the prompt and timely discharge by such employees of their normal duties.
 
(b)
 
Parent agrees to use all reasonable commercial efforts to complete the Senior Secured Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, including using all reasonable commercial efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent or any of its affiliates in such definitive agreements and (iii) consummate the Senior Secured Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter at Closing. Upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2, Parent shall borrow under the Senior Secured Financing such funds as it needs to meet its obligations hereunder and to complete the Refinancing and shall apply such proceeds thereof to the Refinancing.
 
(c)
 
In the event any portion of the Senior Secured Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, Parent shall use all reasonable commercial efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing, including from alternative sources,
43
on terms that, after giving full effect to the flex provisions in the Debt Commitment Letter, are not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Parent shall in no event be obligated to accept any substitute debt financing on terms (taken in the aggregate) materially less favorable to Parent than the Senior Secured Financing would have been. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice upon becoming aware of any breach by any party of the Debt Commitment Letters or any termination of any Debt Commitment Letters. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Senior Secured Financing and shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision of or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letters in any material respect adverse to the Company without the prior written consent of the Company.

Senior Notes
 
(a)
 
The Company shall commence, or shall cause USCC to commence, on or prior to the fourth Business Day following the date of this Agreement or on any later date requested by the Company and consented to by Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), offers to purchase, and related consent solicitations to eliminate certain covenants and provisions in the applicable Indenture (as defined below) relating to, all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of USCCs 12-3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2010 (the 
Subordinated Notes
) and USCCs 10-7/8% Senior Secured Notes due 2010 (the 
Secured Notes
, and together with the Subordinated Notes, the 
Notes
) on the terms and conditions set forth in one or more offers to purchase, letters of transmittal and other related documents (collectively, the 
Debt Offer Documents
), each in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent (the 
Debt Offer
). The parties agree that, and the Debt Offer Documents shall reflect that, consummation of the Debt Offer shall be conditioned on (i) receipt of valid and unrevoked consents from holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of each series of outstanding Notes (the 
Consent Condition
), (ii) the execution and delivery of the supplemental indentures referred to in Section 6.10(b) by the applicable trustee, (iii) the consummation of the Merger and (iv) the satisfaction of other customary conditions to be set forth in the Debt Offer Documents. The Company (i) shall waive any of the conditions to the Debt Offer (other than that the Merger shall have been consummated) and make any change to the terms and conditions of the Debt Offer as may be reasonably requested by Parent so long as the Parent agrees to hold the Company and USCC harmless from any cost or expense relating to or arising from such waiver or changes and (ii) shall not, without the written consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Debt Offer or make any changes to the terms and conditions of the Debt Offer. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Offer Documents, the Company shall not be required to amend the terms and conditions of the Debt Offer pursuant to instructions from Parent if such amendment would decrease the price per applicable Note payable in the Debt Offer, increase the Consent Condition, impose conditions to the Debt Offer in addition to those set forth in the Debt Offer Documents that are materially adverse to the tendering holders of the Notes, materially interfere with the
44
ability of the Company or USCC to complete the Spin-Off or materially interfere with Parents ability to obtain the Senior Secured Financing.
 
(b)
 
The Company covenants and agrees that, promptly following the consent payment deadline described in the Debt Offer Documents, assuming the requisite consents are received, it shall, shall cause its subsidiaries (as applicable) and shall use reasonable commercial efforts to cause the applicable trustee and the collateral agent under the security documents relating to the Secured Notes, as applicable, to execute (i) a supplemental indenture to the Indenture, dated as of October 4, 2000 (the 
2000 Indenture
), among the Company, as parent guarantor, USCC, as issuer, and Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, relating to the Subordinated Notes, (ii) a supplemental indenture to the Indenture, dated as of July 22, 2003 (together with the 2000 Indenture, the 
Indentures
), among the Company, as parent guarantor, USCC, as issuer, and Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, N.A., as trustee, relating to the Secured Notes and (iii) appropriate amendments to the security documents relating to the Secured Notes, which supplemental indentures and amendments to the security documents shall implement the proposed amendments set forth in the Debt Offer Documents and shall become operative substantially concurrently with, but prior to, the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the conditions to the Debt Offer). Subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Debt Offer set forth in the Debt Offer Documents (including, without limitation, the Consent Condition), substantially concurrently with, but not until after, the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to accept for payment and, as promptly as practicable thereafter, but subject to Section 6.10(e) below, Parent shall provide the Surviving Corporation with all funds necessary to pay for the Notes that have been properly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Debt Offer and in accordance with the Debt Offer Documents.
 
(c)
 
All mailings to the holders of the Notes in connection with the Debt Offer shall be subject to prior review and comment by Parent, and no Debt Offer Document shall be mailed or otherwise distributed to holders of the Notes without the written consent of Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If at any time prior to the completion of the Debt Offer any information in or concerning the Debt Offer Documents is discovered by the Company or Parent, which information should be included in an amendment or supplement to the Debt Offer Documents to prevent the Debt Offer Documents from containing any untrue statement of a material fact or from omitting to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be disseminated to the holders of the Notes.
 
(d)
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.10, the Company shall comply, and shall cause its subsidiaries to comply, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and any other Law to the extent such Law is applicable in connection with the Debt Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any applicable Law conflict with this Section 6.10, the Company shall
45
comply with such applicable Law and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations hereunder by such compliance.
 
(e)
 
Parent agrees to pay up to an aggregate of $30,000,000 with respect to the excess (the 
Premium
) of the sum of the Total Purchase Price (as such term is defined in the offers to purchase included in the Debt Offer Documents) with respect to the Subordinated Notes and the Secured Notes over the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. In addition, whether or not the Debt Offer is completed, Parent agrees to pay fees and expenses of any dealer manager, information agent, depositary or other agent retained in connection with the Debt Offer, each of whom shall be selected by Parent (with the consent of the Company not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), pursuant to customary arrangements and agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent. The Securityholders agree to pay the amount of Premium in excess of $30,000,000.

(b)
 
All Tax sharing or similar agreements under which the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary may at any time have an obligation to indemnify for or share the
46

Pre-Closing Tax Period
); (ii) any breach of any covenant of the Securityholders contained in this Section 6.12; (iii) the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by the Company in Section 3.12 (without giving effect to any qualification as to materiality set forth therein);
provided
,
however
, that the representation as to the truth, correctness and completeness of the Tax Returns of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not be construed to constitute a representation as to the amount or expiration date of any of the U.S. Federal net operating losses or net operating loss carryforwards of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries except to the extent provided in Section 6.12(e)(viii) below;
provided further
, that any indemnification for any breaches of the representation in Section 3.12(d) above as to the minimum amount of the Companys and the Transferred Subsidiarys U.S. federal net operating losses and net operating loss carryforwards shall be governed by Section 6.12(e)(viii) below; (iv) the portion of any Transfer Taxes for which the Securityholders are responsible under Sections 6.12(c) and (d); (v) Taxes imposed on the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to, or as a result of, any transaction taken pursuant to the Spin-Off Agreement (including any transaction taken in contemplation of, or as a preliminary step for, a transaction taken pursuant to the Spin-Off Agreement); (vi) Taxes, other than Transfer Taxes, payable by the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period by reason of the Company or any Company Subsidiary being severally liable for the Tax of any Person pursuant to Treas.

Lost Tax Benefit
) due to the reduction in the Company's or any Transferred Subsidiary's U.S. Federal net operating loss carryforwards either as a result of (a) any transactions taken pursuant to the Spin-Off Agreement (including any transaction taken in contemplation of, or as a preliminary step for, a transaction taken pursuant to the Spin-Off
47
Agreement), but only to the extent that such reduction in the Companys or any Transferred Subsidiarys U.S. Federal net operating loss carryforwards is not attributable to $31 million of such loss being reduced as a result of gain recognized under Section 987 of the Code or such loss being characterized as a dual consolidated loss under Section 1503 of the Code or (b) any pre-Closing transaction, pre-Closing tax position or other pre-Closing activity (collectively, 
Pre-Closing Activities
) but only to the extent that such Pre-Closing Activities individually or in the aggregate cause the aggregate amount of the U.S. federal net operating losses and net operating loss carryforwards of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries to be less than $70 million (collectively with (a), 
Foregone NOLs
), which such Lost Tax Benefit shall be equal to the present value of an amount equal to the product of (x) the Foregone NOLs multiplied by (y) 39%, assuming in such present value calculation that the Foregone NOLs would not have been used until the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date and that the discount rate is equal to nine percent (9%);
provided
,
however
, that the Securityholders will be liable for Taxes pursuant to clauses (i) through (viii) above only to the extent such Taxes exceed the amount, if any, of Taxes taken into account in the calculation of Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.8 or to the extent not paid pursuant to another provision of this Section 6.12. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the $70 million limitation contained in Sections 3.12(d) and 6.12(e)(viii)(b) do not apply to Section 6.12(e)(viii)(a).
 
(f)
 
In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary based upon or measured by net income or receipts for the Pre-Closing Period will be calculated as though the taxable year of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries terminated as of the end of the day on the Closing Date;
provided
,
however
, that in the case of a Tax of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period not based on net income or receipts, the amount of Tax for the Pre-Closing Period shall be deemed to equal the amount of Tax for the Taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days from the beginning of the Straddle Period through the Closing Date and the denominator of which shall be the number of days in the Straddle Period. For Tax Returns relating to the Straddle Periods, the Securityholders shall pay to the Parent within fifteen (15) days before the date on which such Taxes are to be paid the portion of such Taxes which relates to the portion of such Taxable period ending on the Closing Date, as shown on the Tax Returns prepared by Parent in accordance with Section 6.12(a).

Tax Contest

In the case of a Tax Contest after the Closing Date that relates exclusively to a Taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, the Securityholders shall have the right, but not the obligation, to control (at their own expense) any resulting proceedings and to determine whether and when to settle, compromise and/or concede all or any portion of such Tax Contest;
provided
,
however
, that (i) the Securityholders shall have acknowledged that they are liable to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for such Taxes or Lost Tax Benefits under this Section 6.12. If Parent so elects, it may override the election of the Securityholders to control the prosecution and defense of such Tax Contest, in which case the
48
Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be deemed to have waived their rights to indemnification under this Agreement for any Taxes, Lost Tax Benefits or Losses relating to, arising out of, or resulting from such Tax Contest. The Surviving Corporation shall control any Tax Contests that do not relate exclusively to a Taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date;
provided
,
however
, that the Securityholders may participate (at their own expense) in any Tax Contest relating to Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax Periods or to Taxes or Lost Tax Benefits for which the Securityholders are or may be otherwise liable under this Agreement, and the Surviving Corporation shall not settle, compromise and/or concede all or any relevant portion of such Tax Contest without the prior written consent of the Securityholders, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, unless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties have waived their rights to indemnification under this Agreement for any and all Taxes, Lost Tax Benefits and/or Losses relating to, arising out of or resulting from such Tax Contest.
 
(h)
 
Parent and the Securityholders shall cooperate fully with each other and with each partys accounting firms and legal counsel, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 6.12 and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes or Lost Tax Benefits or pertaining to the Transactions.

(i)
 
The provisions in this Section 6.12, and not the provisions in Section 9.2(a) or 9.2(b) (Indemnification) or Section 9.3(b) (Claims for Indemnification), shall govern with respect to indemnification claims pertaining to Taxes or Losses attributable to Taxes for which the Securityholders are or may be liable under this Agreement;
provided
,
however
, that for the avoidance of doubt, the parties obligations and rights pursuant to this Section 6.12 shall be subject to the limitations and procedures set forth in Section 9.4 (Limitation on Indemnification), Section 9.5 (Held Back Consideration), Section 9.6 (Exclusive Remedy), Section 9.7 (Adjustment of Merger Consideration), and Section 9.8 (Payments to Securityholders) and the provision of Section 9.4(c) shall govern with respect to indemnification claims pertaining to Taxes or Losses relating to Taxes for which Parent and Newco are or may be liable under this Agreement, including this Section 6.12;
provided
,
however
, that indemnification claims pursuant to Section 6.12(e)(viii)(a) shall not be subject to Section 9.4(a)(i). The obligations of the Parties pursuant to this Section 6.12 shall survive until ninety (90) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (for the avoidance of doubt, the applicable statute of limitations for net operating loss carryforwards shall be the statute of limitations for the tax year in which the loss is utilized).
 
(j)
 
Parent and each of the Securityholders agree to treat any payments under this Section 6.12 as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes.
49
(k)

(b)
 
The Company shall keep Parent informed on a regular basis concerning the developments in the transactions contemplated by the Spin-Off Agreement and the means by which such transactions are effected and, subject to any existing agreements as to the means of effecting the transactions that are reflected in the Spin-Off Agreement, the Company shall give reasonable consideration to Parents views on the means by which such transactions are effected.

If after the Closing Date, Parent fails to qualify as a WKSI, or the Shelf Registration Statement becomes ineffective for any other reason, Parent shall promptly (and in no event later than thirty (30) days after the Shelf Registration Statement becomes ineffective) provide an adequate alternative means to register the Merger Consideration. Subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement with respect to Held Back Consideration, a Securityholder shall be entitled, upon at least two (2) Business Days prior written notice to Parent, to sell such number of shares of Parent Common Stock as are then registered pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement (or such alternative means of registration). The Securityholder shall also give Parent prompt written notice of the consummation of such sale. Parents obligation to maintain the effectiveness of such Shelf Registration Statement (or such alternative means of registration) shall terminate at such time as the Merger Consideration is freely tradeable pursuant to the Rule 144 promulgated by the SEC or any successor to such rule or any other rule or regulation of the SEC that may at any time permit the Securityholders to sell the Merger Consideration to the public without registration. Parent shall have the right to postpone the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement (or such alternative means of registration) for a reasonable period of time if Parent furnishes the Securityholders Representative with a certificate signed by an officer of Parent stating that Parents board of directors, in its good faith judgment, has determined that effecting the registration or a sale at such time would adversely affect a material financing, acquisition, disposition of assets or stock, merger or other comparable transaction or would require Parent to make public disclosure of information the public disclosure of which would have a material adverse effect upon Parent.

(b)
 
Any Company Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.15, upon learning of any such Claim, shall notify the Surviving Corporation (although the failure so to notify the Surviving Corporation shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation from any liability that the Surviving Corporation may have under this Section 6.15, except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the Surviving Corporation). The Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Company Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Company Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or if there is an actual or potential conflict of interest between, or different defenses exist for the Surviving Corporation and the Company Parties, the Company Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Company Parties promptly as statements therefor are received;

Claims for Indemnification
 
(a)
 
Whenever any claim shall arise for indemnification, the party seeking indemnification (the 
Indemnified Party
) shall promptly notify the party from whom indemnification is sought (the 
Indemnifying Party
) of the claim, and the facts constituting the basis for such claim in reasonable detail. The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the defense of such action is materially prejudiced thereby.
 
(b)
 
If the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of any claim or demand pursuant to Section 9.3(a), and if such claim or demand relates to a claim or demand asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party (a 
Third Party Claim
), the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim (at its cost and expense) and to defend any such Third Party Claim in good faith by appropriate actions diligently pursued. The Indemnified Party (at its cost and expense) shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in (but not control) the defense of any such Third Party Claim;
provided
,
however
, that the Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at the Indemnifying Partys cost and expense, to retain one firm of separate counsel of its own choosing (along with any required local counsel) if (i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party so mutually agree or (ii) the named parties in any such proceeding include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel that representation of both sets of parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicts in connection with the defense of the Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim in accordance with this Section 9.3 within fifteen (15) days after receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim or fails to diligently pursue the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party against which such Third Party Claim has been asserted shall (upon delivering notice to such effect to the Indemnifying Party) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise and settlement of such third party claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any resulting settlement of such Third Party Claim and for any final judgment with respect thereto (subject to any right of appeal), if any, but only to the extent otherwise provided in this Agreement. In the event the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party reasonably informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise or settlement, and in the event the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise or settlement. In no event shall the Indemnified Party settle or compromise such Third Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party or Indemnifying Parties, as the case may be. The Indemnifying Party or Indemnifying Parties, as the case may be, may not settle or compromise such Third Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) unless such judgment, compromise or settlement (a) provides for the payment by the Indemnifying Party of money as sole relief for the claimant, (b) results in the full and general release of the Indemnified Parties from all liabilities arising or relating to, or in
59
connection with, the Third Party Claim and (c) involves no finding or admission of any violation of Law or the rights of any person. The Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnifying Parties, as the case may be, or its or their representatives all records and other materials reasonably required for use in contesting any Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party or Indemnifying Parties in the defense of all such claims. This Section 9.3(b) shall not apply to Losses related to Taxes, as to which Section 6.12 shall govern.

Deductible

60
Indemnified Party will notify the Indemnifying Party that it has realized such Tax benefit and will promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party in the amount of the Tax benefit so realized. Other than in respect of a Third Party Claim, an Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under this Article IX in respect of any claim for incidental, special, punitive or consequential damages, including consequential damages resulting from lost profits.
 
(d)
 
The amount that any Indemnifying Party is required to pay to, for or on behalf of any Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article IX shall be adjusted by any insurance proceeds actually received by any Indemnified Party in reduction of the related indemnifiable Loss after reduction for any costs or expenses incurred in connection with collecting such proceeds or payments (which the Indemnified Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to collect).
