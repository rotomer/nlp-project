Item 1.01.   Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
On April 26, 2006, the Human Resources Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors (the Board) of Ball Corporation (the Company) took the following actions which were approved by the Board:
The Committee approved the restated Ball Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan (the Plan) that was effective January 1, 2005. The purpose of the Plan is to continue to provide Participants (as defined below) with an opportunity to defer receipt of a portion of their salary, bonus or other specified cash compensation in compliance with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and take advantage of certain transition opportunities presented in Notice 2005-1 and reaffirmed in the proposed regulations published on October 4, 2005. "Participants" under the Plan shall be eligible employees employed by the Company or its subsidiaries who can elect to defer compensation in accordance with the Plan, as well as Company Awards, which may be a match made by the Company from time to time to the account of a Participant. The deferral of compensation may be invested by means of a conversion of a dollar amount of deferred compensation and Company Awards credited to Participants deferred compensation accounts. The conversion shall occur as if shares or units of the designated investment were being purchased or sold (in the case of distribution) at the purchase price as of the close of business the day on which the deemed investment occurs. There is no real or beneficial ownership of any security pursuant to any investment option selected by a Participant. Distributions may be made in accordance with the Plan, at the Participants election, either in a lump sum or equal annual installments from 2 to 15 years, or a combination thereof. The Plan shall be administered by the Deferred Compensation Committee of the Company which shall act as the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator shall have discretionary authority to make, amend, interpret and enforce all appropriate rules and regulations for the administration of this Plan and benefits thereunder, resolve questions concerning the Plan and its terms, including but not limited to, eligibility for benefits and claims filed with the Plan Administrator. The Ball Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended and restated, is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 to this current report on Form 8-K.
The Committee approved the restated Ball Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Company Stock Plan (the Plan) that was effective January 1, 2005. The purpose of the Plan is to continue to provide Participants (eligible employees of the Company or its subsidiaries as well as directors of the Company) with an opportunity to defer receipt of a portion of their salary, bonus or other specified cash compensation in compliance with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and take advantage of certain transition opportunities presented in Notice 2005-1 and reaffirmed in the proposed regulations published on October 4, 2005. Deferrals shall be made to Participants accounts and include Company Awards, any Company matching contributions, return on units, payments and such other transactions that may be required to properly administer the Plan. The value of each deferred
compensation account shall be based on the value of the Companys common stock. The value of such deferred compensation account shall be determined by multiplying the number of units by the value of one share of Company stock on the New York Stock Exchange composite listing on the applicable payment date. The Plan shall be administered by the Deferred Compensation Committee of the Company which shall act as the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator shall have discretionary authority to make, amend, interpret and enforce all appropriate rules and regulations for the administration of this Plan and benefits thereafter, resolve questions concerning the Plan and its terms, including but not limited to, eligibility for benefits and claims filed with the Plan Administrator. Participants may elect distributions in accordance with the Plan either in a lump sum or in annual installments from 2 to 15 years, or a combination thereof. The Ball Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Company Stock Plan, as amended and restated, is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 to this current report on Form 8-K.
The Committee approved the restated Ball Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan (the Plan) for Directors that was effective January 1, 2005. The purpose of the Plan is to continue to provide Participants (non-management directors of the Company) with an opportunity to defer receipt of a part or all the cash portion of their annual incentive retainers, fees and other cash compensation in compliance with the Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and to take advantage of certain transition opportunities presented in Notice 2005-1 and reaffirmed in the proposed regulations published on October 4, 2005. The deferral of compensation may be invested by means of a conversion of a dollar amount of deferred compensation and Company Awards credited to Participants deferred compensation accounts. The conversion shall occur as if shares or units of the designated investment were being purchased or sold (in the case of distribution) at the purchase price as of the close of business the day on which the deemed investment occurs. There is no real or beneficial ownership of any security pursuant to any investment option selected by a Participant. Participants may elect distributions in accordance with the Plan in either a lump sum or in annual installments from 2 to 15 years, or combination thereof. The Plan shall be administered by the Deferred Compensation Committee of the Company which shall act as the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator shall have discretionary authority to make, amend, interpret and enforce all appropriate rules and regulations for the administration of this Plan and benefits thereunder, resolve questions concerning the Plan and its terms, including but not limited to, eligibility for benefits and claims filed with the Plan Administrator. The Ball Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors, as amended and restated, is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.3 to this current report on Form 8-K.
The foregoing summary of some of the general provisions of the Ball Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan, the Ball Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Company Stock Plan and the Ball Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to each of the Plans, which are filed as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 to this current report on Form 8-K.

Ball Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan For Directors
Article I
Establishment and Purpose
Ball Corporation (the Company) has maintained and will continue to maintain the Ball Corporation 2001 Deferred Compensation Plan and predecessor deferred compensation plans (the Grandfathered Plans).
The Company hereby adopts the Ball Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan, restated as of April 26, 2006 (the Plan). The purpose of the Plan continues to be to attract and retain key Employees by providing such Employees the opportunity to defer the cash portion of their annual incentive awards and other cash compensation specified by the Human Resources Committee (the HR Committee) of the Board of Directors.
In December, 2005, the Company adopted an interim document in response to proposed Treasury regulations published on October 4, 2005, that required the Company to adopt written amendments prior to December 31, 2005, with respect to items of transition relief described in Notice 2005-1 and that expired on December 31, 2005. The interim document was intended to satisfy the amendment requirements of the proposed regulations without the amendment constituting a material modification to the Grandfathered Plans, but subject to restatement in 2006 to reflect the requirements of Code Section 409A. Accordingly, the Company adopts this Plan document, as of the date set forth on the signature page below and effective as of the Effective Date, to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A.
The Plan is intended to be an unfunded arrangement providing deferred compensation to eligible employees who are part of a select group of management or highly compensated employees of the Company within the meaning of Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA.

Exhibit 99
BROOMFIELD, Colo., April 27, 2006 - Ball Corporation [NYSE:BLL] today reported first quarter 2006 earnings of $44.6 million, or 43 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.37 billion, compared to $58.6 million, or 51 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.32 billion in the first quarter of 2005.
First quarter results a year ago reflected unusually strong sales and operating earnings for metal food cans in advance of announced price increases brought about by the rising cost of steel used to manufacture the cans. This situation did not repeat itself in the first quarter of 2006 and overall results returned to more normal levels, such as the first quarter of 2004 when earnings were $46.8 million, or 41 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.23 billion.
The first quarter of 2006 included less than one weeks results at the end of March from the aerosol and specialty can business acquired from the owners of U.S. Can Corp. and the plastic bottle business acquired from Alcan. Also included in the 2006 first quarter results is a business consolidation charge equal to one cent per diluted share to shut down a metal food can manufacturing line in Canada.
R. David Hoover, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said some factors affecting 2006 results versus 2005 were anticipated and others were not.
Earnings per diluted share were adversely affected by four cents for foreign exchange, three cents of which pertained to prior years, Hoover said. As was anticipated, the abnormal first quarter we had in 2005 in what is now our metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segment, did not repeat in 2006. Further, we expect results for the rest of the year from our legacy metal food container business to be better than 2005 due to a more normal seasonal sales pattern.
We were pleased to get our two acquisitions completed as early as we did, and we expect them to be accretive to full year 2006 results, Hoover said. The integration process is underway and, as we anticipated, both of the acquired companies appear to be good fits with Ball, both operationally and culturally.
Ball Corp. - 2
Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas
Earnings in the companys metal beverage packaging, Americas, segment were $54.5 million on sales of $592.4 million, compared to $61.8 million on sales of $544.1 million in the first quarter of 2005.
Costs for fuel, utilities, coatings and other direct materials used in the manufacture of beverage cans were approximately $10 million higher in the first quarter of 2006 than they were in the first quarter of 2005.
Progress continued on a multi-year project to significantly upgrade and streamline the companys manufacture of beverage can ends. Also, the conversion of a manufacturing line in the companys Monticello, Ind., plant from the production of standard 12-ounce cans to the production of specialty size cans was completed in the quarter.
Despite the somewhat slow start to the year for metal beverage packaging, Americas, we expect to earn more in this segment in 2006 than we did in 2005 as our capital projects take hold and we fully realize the benefits of volumes rebounding to pre-2005 levels, Hoover said.
Metal Beverage Packaging, Europe/Asia
Earnings in the metal beverage packaging, Europe/Asia, segment were $28.6 million on sales of $300.9 million, compared to $30.3 million on sales of $298 million in the first quarter of 2005. A weakened euro against the dollar contributed to 2006 segment earnings being below 2005.
At the end of the quarter the company experienced a fire in its manufacturing plant in Hassloch, Germany. While the fire damage and business interruption losses largely are covered by insurance, the loss of production, which will continue for an as yet undetermined period, will exacerbate an already tight beverage can supply picture in Europe. The company has taken several steps and is examining numerous options to meet demand and to recover from the disruption caused by the fire.
The effects of the fire will dampen our results from Europe for the remainder of the year, Hoover said. Also, despite our China volumes being strong in the quarter, margins have decreased due to a combination of rapid cost increases and slower than expected price increases to the trade. As a result, on a full-year basis we expect a significant reduction in earnings from China in 2006 but with a recovery in 2007.
Metal Food & Household Products Packaging, Americas
Earnings in the metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segment were $1.8 million ($3.9 million before business consolidation activity) on sales of $189.3 million, compared to $13 million on sales of $184.2 million a year ago. Included in the segment results are the sales and earnings from the U.S. Can Corp. assets acquired on March 27.
 
Ball Corp. - 3
The company recorded a $2.1 million charge ($1.4 million after-tax) in the quarter to permanently idle a metal food can production line in its Whitby, Ontario, manufacturing plant. Metal beverage cans will continue to be produced in Whitby. Further capacity rationalizations in the segment are anticipated as the integration of the former U.S. Can business proceeds.
Plastic Packaging, Americas
Earnings in the plastic packaging, Americas, segment were $1.8 million on sales of $122.4 million, compared to $3.5 million on sales of $115.8 million in the first quarter of 2005. Included in the results are sales and earnings from the Alcan Plastic Bottle assets acquired on March 28.
During the quarter the company continued the installation and reconfiguration of manufacturing capacity at a number of locations. The projects will increase capacity to meet increased demand and should improve productivity.
Energy and other costs in the segment were approximately $1.5 million higher in the first quarter of 2006 compared to the first quarter of 2005. Also, the timing of movements in resin prices resulted in a $1 million negative effect on earnings in the quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2005.
Aerospace and Technologies
Earnings in the aerospace and technologies segment were $9.5 million on sales of $159.9 million, compared to $8.9 million on sales of $182 million a year ago. The 2005 first quarter segment earnings included a $3.8 million write-down of an equity investment.
Work was completed during the quarter on some aerospace and technologies projects while government funding for some other projects has been delayed until later periods, creating a gap in sales and earnings in the segment. Capital spending plans have been adjusted downward accordingly, and actions to right-size the workforce are underway.
We expect the slowdown in the timing for award and funding of certain contracts to cause a significant reduction in our aerospace and technologies segment results in 2006, Hoover said. However, we still fully expect to win our share of contracts when they are awarded. The slippage into later periods should result in positives in 2007 and beyond as important projects for science and national defense are advanced and fully funded. We believe our track record over the 50 years we have been in the aerospace business positions us to benefit in the future from numerous new contracts when they are awarded.
Ball Corp. - 4
Outlook
Raymond J. Seabrook, executive vice president and chief financial officer, said lower interest expense, a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding contributed favorably to Balls first quarter results.
The actions taken in recent years to shape our financing structure and reduce our share count are bearing returns, Seabrook said. At the same time we are investing in our best performing businesses in order to continue to earn in excess of our cost of capital and deliver the kind of performance our investors expect from Ball.
Commenting on the first quarter and full-year 2006, Hoover said, We had a very busy first quarter, completing two acquisitions, finishing some capital projects and continuing to make progress on others and adjusting to changing funding schedules of the government. Results, while below last year, were in line with our expectations.
Even though we anticipate further challenges during 2006, including lower results than last year from our aerospace and technologies segment and in China, we expect overall results to be better than in 2005, Hoover said.
Ball Corporation is a supplier of high-quality metal and plastic packaging products and owns Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. Ball reported 2005 sales of $5.8 billion and employs 15,600 people.
