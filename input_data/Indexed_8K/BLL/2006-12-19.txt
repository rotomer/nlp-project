Following retirement, the Participant may diversify all of the units held in this account into notional mutual fund investment(s). The other fifty percent (50%) of the deferred units will be held in a second account. Each year the Participant may diversify up to fifty percent (50%) of the prior year-end balance of this second account into notional mutual fund investment(s). The twenty percent (20%) match on restricted deferred units (up to a maximum match of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) in a year) would be deposited into the account that must be held in deferred units until retirement. The officers of the Company and their designees are authorized to implement the said amendments effective January 1, 2007, or at such later date in 2007 as the officers of the Company or their designees determine is administratively feasible.

Ball Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Company Stock Plan
Article I
Establishment and Purpose
Ball Corporation (the Company) maintains the Ball Corporation 2000 Deferred Compensation Company Stock Plan and predecessor plans (the Grandfathered Plans).
The Company hereby amends and restates the Ball Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Company Stock Plan, effective as of the Effective Date, except as otherwise noted below (the Plan). The purpose of the Plan continues to be to attract and retain key Employees and Directors by providing such Employees and Directors with the opportunity to defer the cash portion of their annual incentive awards (or, in the case of Directors, of their Annual Fixed Retainer and Annual Incentive Retainer) and other cash compensation specified by the Human Resources Committee (the HR Committee) of the Board of Directors under a nonqualified plan that also aligns the interests of such Employees and Directors with the Company stockholders.
The terms of the Plan were reflected in an interim document adopted by the Company in December, 2005, in response to proposed Treasury regulations published on October 4, 2005, that required the Company to adopt written amendments prior to December 31, 2005, with respect to items of transition relief described in Notice 2005-1 and that expired on December 31, 2005. The interim document was intended to satisfy the amendment requirements of the proposed regulations without the amendment constituting a material modification to the Grandfathered Plans, but subject to restatement in 2006 to reflect the requirements of Code Section 409A. The Plan was subsequently amended and restated effective as of January 1, 2005, to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A, and is now being further amended and restated in order to permit Participants to elect to have their Accounts valued by reference to investments other than Units of Company Stock, and to make certain other changes.
The Plan is intended to be an unfunded arrangement providing deferred compensation to eligible employees who are part of a select group of management or highly compensated employees of the Company within the meaning of Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA.
