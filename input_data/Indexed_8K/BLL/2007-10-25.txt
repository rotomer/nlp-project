On October 25, 2007, Ball Corporation (the Company) issued a press release announcing its third quarter earnings for 2007, which results are set forth in the press release dated October 25, 2007, and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
Earnings information regarding the third quarter for 2007, as well as information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures, are set forth in the attached press release.
The information in this Report shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the Exchange Act) or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
On October 23, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a plan to close two aerosol container manufacturing plants in the United States and will exit the custom and specialty tinplate can business as part of a restructuring of the Companys metal food and household products packaging division, Americas.
The Company plans to close aerosol can manufacturing plants in Commerce, California, and Tallapoosa, Georgia, and relocate certain of the related aerosol and container manufacturing equipment into existing metal food container facilities.  Ball makes custom and specialty tinplate cans in its Baltimore, Maryland, plant, and intends to sell that facility.  All three facilities were acquired in 2006 as part of the Companys acquisition of U.S. Can Corporation.  The two plant closures will result in a net reduction in manufacturing capacity of 10 production lines, including the relocation of two high-speed aerosol lines into Ball facilities.
The Company will record a largely noncash, after-tax charge of approximately $26 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 related to the plant closures and equipment relocation.  When completed in 2009, the actions are expected to yield annualized cost savings in excess of $15 million.
The following is furnished as an exhibit to this report:
Exhibit 99.1                                Ball Corporation Press Release dated October 25, 2007.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date:   October 25, 2007

Exhibit 99.1
BROOMFIELD, Colo., Oct. 25, 2007Ball Corporation [NYSE:BLL] today reported third quarter earnings of $60.9 million, or 59 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.91 billion, compared to $107.1 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, on sales of $1.82 billion in the third quarter of 2006.
For the first nine months of 2007, Balls results were earnings of $248 million, or $2.40 per diluted share, on sales of $5.63 billion, compared to $281.3 million, or $2.68 per diluted share, on sales of $5.03 billion in the same period in 2006.
Both the third quarter and the nine-month results in 2007 include an after-tax charge of $51.8 million, or 50 cents per diluted share, related to the settlement of a dispute with a beverage can customer in the metal beverage packaging, Americas, segment. The 2006 results include a gain of $2.8 million ($1.7 million after tax, or two cents per diluted share) in the third quarter and $76.9 million ($46.9 million after tax, or 45 cents per diluted share) in the first nine months for insurance recovery from a fire at a plant in Germany.
The 2007 results through three quarters do not include an after-tax charge of approximately $26 million that will result from facility closures and related equipment relocation activities associated with plans the company announced Wednesday as part of the continuing consolidation of its food and household products packaging, Americas, segment. That charge will occur in the fourth quarter of 2007.
We had a solid quarter, led by outstanding results in our metal beverage packaging, Europe/Asia, and our aerospace and technologies segments, said R. David Hoover, chairman, president and chief executive officer. Operating results in our metal beverage packaging, Americas, segment were slightly lower than a year ago in the quarter, but for the full year they remain well above 2006. We announced this week a restructuring plan to improve results in our metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segment. We continue to have discussions with our customer base about the need to improve results there and in our underperforming plastic packaging, Americas, segment.

Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas
The 2007 sales and operating earnings for both the quarter and the first nine months were reduced by the $85.6 million pre-tax charge related to the customer settlement. Operating earnings in the quarter before the customer settlement for the metal beverage packaging, Americas, segment were $65 million on sales of $728.8 million, compared to $73 million on sales of $659.6 million in the third quarter of 2006. For the first nine months segment results before the customer settlement were earnings of $241.4 million on sales of $2.2 billion, compared to $193.5 million on sales of $1.99 billion in the first three quarters of 2006.
Demand continued to be strong, particularly for specialty size beverage cans, during the third quarter in the metal beverage packaging, Americas, segment, Hoover said. To help meet that demand, we plan to install a new 24-ounce can production line in our Monticello, Ind., facility in time for the 2008 summer sales period.
Metal Beverage Packaging, Europe/Asia
Third quarter earnings in the metal beverage packaging, Europe/Asia, segment were $81 million on sales of $522.4 million, compared to $66 million, including $2.8 million in property insurance gains, on sales of $425.1 million in the third quarter of 2006. For the first nine months segment earnings were $218.5 million on sales of $1.45 billion, compared to $235.7 million, including $76.9 million in property insurance gains, on sales of $1.16 billion in the same period in 2006.
Results in Europe were helped by higher selling prices, continued cost optimization efforts, and by a full quarters contribution from the new lines added in Hassloch and Hermsdorf, Germany, to replace the capacity lost in the fire last year, Hoover said. We have announced plans for line speedups and are looking at possible additional can and end manufacturing capacity in Europe to meet the continued demand growth there.
Metal Food & Household Products Packaging, Americas
Earnings for the third quarter in the metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segment were $14.5 million on sales of $349.5 million, compared to $19.7 million on sales of $366 million in the third quarter of 2006. For the first nine months of 2007, earnings were $25.4 million on sales of $912.3 million, compared to $25.5 million, including a $1.7 million charge for costs to shut down a food can manufacturing line in Canada, on sales of $850.5 million.

Results in our metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segment remain below acceptable levels, Hoover said. As part of the ongoing process of integrating the assets we acquired in March 2006 and improving overall performance, we have announced plans to close two manufacturing plants and exit the custom and decorative tinplate can business. Although some manufacturing equipment from the facilities being closed will be relocated to other Ball facilities, we expect an overall reduction in manufacturing capacity of approximately 10 production lines. When completed, this restructuring is expected to yield annualized cost savings in excess of $15 million.
Plastic Packaging, Americas
Third quarter results in the plastic packaging, Americas, segment were earnings of $7.7 million on sales of $195 million, compared to $7.9 million on sales of $201.2 million in the third quarter of 2006. For the first three quarters of 2007, results were earnings of $17.1 million on sales of $580.3 million, compared to $18.3 million on sales of $521.1 million in the same period in 2006.
Sales volumes were up slightly from the third quarter of 2006, due in part to the inclusion of our plastic pail business, which was transferred to this segment at the beginning of 2007, Hoover said. However, we remain disappointed with the sales of commodity PET bottles.
Aerospace and Technologies
Earnings in the third quarter for the aerospace and technologies segment were $18.3 million on sales of $196.4 million, compared to $15.6 million on sales of $170.4 million in the third quarter of 2006. For the first nine months of 2007, earnings were $53.5 million on sales of $596.9 million, compared to $33.4 million on sales of $505.7 million in the first three quarters of 2006.
Our aerospace and technologies segment had an excellent quarter and earnings through three quarters exceed all of 2006 for the segment, Hoover said. The successful launch on Sept. 18 of the WorldView-1 satellite we built for DigitalGlobe marked another important achievement for Ball Aerospace. This next-generation imaging satellite and the WorldView-2 spacecraft we currently have in development will be the most agile commercial imaging spacecraft ever flown.
Outlook
Raymond J. Seabrook, executive vice president and chief financial officer, said a lower effective tax rate helped third quarter results.

We concluded our negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service regarding interest expenses incurred on loans under a company-owned life insurance plan, with the majority of the interest deductions being upheld, Seabrook said. Legislated reductions in European corporate tax rates and other favorable tax issues resulted in an overall lower tax rate in the quarter.
Our adjusted full-year free cash flow is still on track to exceed $400 million and our stock buyback is projected at $200 million, Seabrook said.
We are taking aggressive steps to better position Ball Corporation for the future, Hoover said. We are determined to make our best businesses even better and to bring our underperforming businesses to more acceptable levels.
We have announced plans for expansion in some of the worlds strongest growth markets and are examining other similar opportunities. We are continuing the process of integrating and rationalizing assets in the mature metal food and household products packaging market, Hoover said.

During the second quarter of 2007, Miller Brewing Company (a U.S. customer) asserted various claims against a wholly owned subsidiary of the company. On October 4, 2007, the dispute was settled in mediation. Ball retains all of Millers beverage can and end business through 2015. Miller receives $85.6 million ($51.8 million after tax), with approximately $70 million to be paid in the first quarter of 2008.
The remainder of this third quarter accrual will be recovered over the life of the contract.
In April 2006 a fire in our metal beverage can plant in Hassloch, Germany, significantly damaged the plant. Property insurance gains of $74.1 million ($45.2 million after tax) and $2.8 million ($1.7 million after tax) were recorded in the second and third quarters of 2006, respectively. During the second quarter of 2007, we brought into full production the replacement capacity we installed after the fire.
In the second quarter of 2006, earnings of $0.4 million ($0.2 million after tax) were recorded to reflect the recovery of amounts previously expensed in a 2005 business consolidation charge.
In the first quarter of 2006, a net $2.1 million charge ($1.4 million after tax) was recorded in the metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segment primarily to shut down a food can line. The charge was reduced during the fourth quarter of 2006 by $0.7 million ($0.5 million after tax) to reflect higher proceeds received on the disposition of fixed assets.
A summary of the effects of the legal settlement and the above transactions on after-tax earnings is as follows:
Balls management segregates the above items to evaluate the companys performance of current operations. The above is presented on a non-U.S. GAAP basis and should be considered in connection with the unaudited statements of consolidated earnings. Non-U.S. GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation.

The 2007 third quarter tax provision has been reduced by $7 million, net, due to enacted third quarter tax rate reductions in Germany and the United Kingdom, offset by reduced tax credits in the U.S. The third quarter 2006 tax provision was reduced by $6.4 million due to the settlement of various tax matters.
Also in the third quarter of 2007, the company realized a tax loss pertaining to its Canadian operations and concluded our negotiations with the IRS concerning disallowed interest deductions under a company-owned life insurance plan, with the majority of the interest deductions being upheld. These items reduced the third quarter 2007 provision by $10.2 million net.
On October 24, 2007, Ball announced plans to close two manufacturing facilities and to exit the custom and decorative tinplate can business located in Baltimore, Maryland. Ball will close its food and household products packaging facilities in Tallapoosa, Georgia, and Commerce, California, both of which manufacture aerosol and general line cans.  The two plant closures will result in a net reduction in manufacturing capacity of 10 production lines, including the relocation of two high-speed aerosol lines into existing Ball facilities.  An after-tax charge of approximately $26 million will be recorded in the fourth quarter and, once completed in early 2009, these actions are expected to yield annualized pretax cost savings in excess of $15 million. The cash costs of these actions are expected to be offset by proceeds on asset dispositions and tax recoveries.
