Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas and Asia
Earnings for the quarter in the metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, segment were $74 million on sales of $833.9 million. In 2007, second quarter earnings in the segment were $89.1 million on sales of $871.2 million. For the first six months, earnings in 2008 were $148 million on sales of $1.54 billion, compared to $191 million on sales of $1.57 billion in the first half of 2007.
The second quarter and first half of 2008 included a charge of $10.6 million to close a metal beverage container manufacturing plant in Kent, Wash. Also in the second quarter, a decision to continue to operate existing end-making equipment and not install a new end-module that would have been part of a multi-year project resulted in a gain of $7.2 million for the recovery of costs previously provided for closure obligations.
Improved operating performance in the quarter partially offset the effects of softer North American volumes and the absence in 2008 of the North American inventory gain realized in the second quarter of 2007. Sales volumes in China increased 20 percent.

Metal Beverage Packaging, Europe
Second quarter earnings in the metal beverage packaging, Europe, segment were $77.2 million on sales of $571 million, compared to $86.1 million on sales of $484.8 million a year ago. For the first six months, earnings were $125.2 million on sales of $976.6 million, compared to $122.9 million on sales of $805.5 million in the first half of 2007.
Volumes in the metal beverage packaging, Europe, segment were up approximately 7 percent over 2007 levels for the quarter despite cool, wet weather in much of eastern and central Europe and transportation and customer strikes in France and Spain. The strength of the euro contributed to higher European beverage can earnings in the quarter and helped offset the absence of $17 million of business interruption insurance proceeds in 2007 stemming from a 2006 fire at a German plant.
Metal Food & Household Products Packaging, Americas
The metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segment second quarter results were earnings of $14.3 million on sales of $283.2 million, compared to $11.1 million on sales of $284 million in 2007. For the first half of 2008, segment earnings were $29.1 million on sales of $547 million, compared to $10.9 million on sales of $562.8 million in the first six months of 2007.
The metal food and household products packaging segments improved performance was driven by increases in pricing, a better product mix and cost reduction activities. The previously announced closing of plants in California and Georgia is on schedule.

Plastic Packaging, Americas
Earnings in the plastic packaging, Americas, segment for the second quarter of 2008 were $1.4 million on sales of $201 million, compared to $7.1 million on sales of $198.7 million in 2007.

The second quarter and first half of 2008 included a charge of $4.3 million for the closure of the Brampton, Ontario, plant. Those operations will be consolidated into the companys other plastic packaging manufacturing facilities in North America. Additional plant closure costs of approximately $2 million are expected to be incurred in the second half of the year. The closure is expected to result in annual, fixed-cost savings of approximately $4 million beginning in 2009.
Aerospace & Technologies
Earnings in the aerospace and technologies segment were $22.7 million on sales of $191.2 million during the second quarter of 2008, compared to $15.6 million on sales of $194.1 million in the same period a year ago.

The first half of 2008 included a pretax gain of $7.1 million on the sale in the first quarter of the segments aerospace engineering services business in Australia.
Improved program execution and contract mix, lower unrecoverable costs and higher profit accruals on certain fixed price contracts as they near completion contributed to the higher earnings.
Outlook
The companys performance during the first six months of 2008 improved upon a record first half performance in 2007, Hoover said. We continue to expect cash flow for the year to be in the range of $300 million, including capital spending of around $330 million. Even with the tough economic conditions our businesses have experienced to date, our goal for the second half of 2008 is to exceed last years solid second half performance.

In June 2008 the company announced the closure of a plastic packaging manufacturing plant in Brampton, Ontario, which employs approximately 90 people.  The closed operations will be consolidated into the companys other plastic packaging manufacturing facilities in North America and will result in a charge of approximately $6 million, of which $4.3 million ($3.8 million after tax) was recorded in the second quarter, with the remaining closure costs to be recorded in the second half of 2008 as they are incurred.
A pretax charge of $3.8 million ($2.3 million after tax), related to previously closed and sold facilities, was also recorded in the second quarter.
