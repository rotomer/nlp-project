On July 23, 2008, the Board of Directors of the Corporation amended the Bylaws, adding to the information that must be set out in a shareholders notice to the Secretary in respect of a nomination for the Board of Directors; and adding to the information that must be set out in a shareholders notice to the Secretary in respect of a shareholder proposal of business at an annual meeting of shareholders.  The revisions provide that the shareholder must, for either of such notices, provide (in addition to previously required information), with respect to such shareholder and any Shareholder Associated Person (as defined in the amended Bylaws), (a) the nominee holder for, and number of, shares owned beneficially but not of record by such person, (b) whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of, or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit interest, options or borrowed or loaned shares) has been made, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to or manage risk or benefit of share price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of, such person with respect to any share of stock of the Corporation, (c) to the extent known by the shareholder giving the notice, with respect to shareholder nominees for the Board of Directors, the name and address of any other shareholder supporting the nominee for election or reelection as a director on the date of such shareholders notice; and with respect to shareholder proposals of business, the name and address of any other shareholder supporting the proposal of business on the date of such shareholders notice, and (d) with respect to shareholder nominees for the Board of Directors, any relationship between or among the shareholder giving notice and any Shareholder Associated Person, on the one hand, and each proposed nominee, on the other hand.  Any such information shall be supplemented by the shareholder giving either of such notices no later than ten (10) days after the record date for the meeting as of the record date.  Additionally, with respect to shareholder nominees for the Board of Directors, the Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the Corporation or that could be material to a reasonable shareholders understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee.
The preceding is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Corporations Bylaws, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and are incorporated herein by reference.

9
 
(2)           The termination of a proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent is not, of itself, determinative that the director or officer did not meet the standard of conduct set forth in the IBCL.
(3)           To the extent that a director or officer has been wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which he was a party, or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, because he is or was a director or officer of the corporation, the corporation shall indemnify the director or officer against reasonable expenses incurred by him in connection therewith regardless of whether the director or officer has met the standards set forth in the IBCL and without any action or determination under Section D of this Article Five.
Section B.  Advancement of Expenses.
(1)           The corporation shall pay for or reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred by a director or officer who is a party to a proceeding in advance of final disposition of the proceeding if:
 
(a)           The director or officer furnishes the corporation a written affirmation of his good faith belief that he has met the standard of conduct set forth in the IBCL;
(b)           The director or officer furnishes the corporation a written undertaking, executed personally or on his behalf, to repay any advances if it is ultimately determined that he is not entitled to indemnification under this Article Five; and
(c)           A determination is made that the facts then known to those making the determination would not preclude indemnification under the IBCL.
(2)           The undertaking required by paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this Section B must be an unlimited general obligation of the director or officer but need not be secured and may be accepted without reference to financial ability to make repayment.
Section C.  Limitations on Indemnification.
(1)           The corporation shall not indemnify a director or officer under Section A of this Article Five unless a determination has been made in the specific case that indemnification of the director is permissible in the circumstances because he has met the standard of conduct set forth in the IBCL.  Such determination shall be made within 60 days of the request for indemnification:
(a)           By the board of directors by majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;
(b)           If a quorum cannot be obtained under paragraph (a) of this subsection, by majority vote of a committee duly designated by the board of directors (in which designation directors who are parties may participate), consisting solely of two or more directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;
10
 
(c)           By special legal counsel:
 
(i)           Selected by the board of directors or its committee in the manner prescribed in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection; or
(ii)          If a quorum of the board of directors cannot be obtained under paragraph (a) of this subsection and a committee cannot be designated under paragraph (b) of this subsection, selected by majority vote of the full board of directors (in which selection directors who are parties may participate); or
(d)           By the shareholders, but the shares owned by or voted under the control of the officers and directors who are at the time parties to the proceeding may not be voted on the determination; provided, however, that following a change of control of the corporation, with respect to all matters thereafter arising out of acts, omissions or events prior to the change of control of the corporation concerning the rights of any person seeking indemnification under this Article Five, such determination shall be made by special legal counsel selected by such person and approved by the board of directors or its committee in the manner described in Section C(1)(c) above (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), which counsel has not otherwise performed services (other than in connection with similar matters) within the five years preceding its engagement to render such opinion for such person or for the corporation or any affiliates (as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) of the corporation (whether or not they were affiliates when services were so performed) (Independent Counsel).  Unless such person has theretofore selected Independent Counsel pursuant to this Section C and such Independent Counsel has been approved by the corporation, legal counsel approved by a resolution or resolutions of the board of directors of the corporation prior to a change of control of the corporation shall be deemed to have been approved by the corporation as required.  Such Independent Counsel shall determine as promptly as practicable whether and to what extent such person would be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law and shall render its written opinion to the corporation and such person to such effect.

Section D.  Enforceability.  
If this Article Five or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director or officer of the corporation as to liabilities incurred in connection with any proceeding, including an action by or in the right of the corporation, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article Five that shall not have been invalidated and to the full extent permitted by the Articles and by applicable law.
Section E.  Severability.  
Section F.  Definitions.
As used in this Article, the term:
(1)           change of control, for purposes of this Article Five, means (i) an acquisition by any person of 30 percent or more of the corporations voting shares; (ii) a merger in which the shareholders of the corporation before the merger own 50 percent or less of the corporations (or the ultimate parent corporations) voting shares after the merger; (iii) shareholder approval of a plan of liquidation or to sell or dispose of substantially all of the assets of the corporation; and (iv) if, during any two-year period, directors at the beginning of the period (and any new directors nominated by a majority of the directors at the beginning of such period) fail to constitute a majority of the board of directors.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a change of control shall not be deemed to occur solely because thirty percent (30%) or more of the then outstanding voting securities is acquired by (i) a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under one or more employee benefit plans maintained by the corporation or any of its subsidiaries or (ii) any corporation which, immediately prior to such acquisition, is owned directly or indirectly by the shareholders of this corporation in the same proportion as their ownership of shares in this corporation immediately prior to such acquisition.
