The wider economic downturn in 2008 prompted us to accelerate ongoing changes within Ball, said John A. Hayes, executive vice president and chief operating officer. As a result, we are poised to further improve operating performance due to effectively managing our asset base, aligning with successful customers and focusing on the execution of our long-term strategy.
Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas & Asia
Metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, comparable segment operating earnings were $284.1 million in 2008 on sales of $2.99 billion, compared to $326.4 million in 2007 on sales of $3.1 billion. For the fourth quarter, comparable earnings were $55.7 million on sales of $684.7 million in 2008, compared to $64.2 million on sales of $728.1 million in 2007. Fourth quarter results were lower primarily due to reduced North American sales volumes and curtailed production for inventory control purposes. Full year results were lower due to a $52 million inventory holding gain in 2007 that did not reoccur in 2008.
During the year Ball announced the closure of three metal beverage packaging plants to further balance the companys capacity in this segment with market changes. Cost reductions associated with these plant closings are expected to exceed $30 million in 2009 and to be over $10 million cash positive upon final disposition of the assets. In China, strong demand and an improved customer mix contributed to improved results.
Metal Beverage Packaging, Europe
Metal beverage packaging, Europe, segment results in 2008 were operating earnings of $230.9 million on sales of $1.87 billion, compared to $228.9 million on sales of $1.65 billion in 2007. For the fourth quarter, operating earnings in 2008 were $29.0 million on sales of $380.8 million, compared to $31.2 million on sales of $393.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. The weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar and the weakening of the British pound sterling against the euro reduced fourth quarter results compared to last year.
Ball elected to slow the timing of announced new metal beverage packaging plants in Poland and India, though the company expects some volume growth in 2009. Cost savings measures continue to be implemented across the business.

Metal Food & Household Products Packaging, Americas
Metal food and household products packaging, Americas, comparable segment results for 2008 were operating earnings of $68.1 million on sales of $1.22 billion, compared to $36.2 million in 2007 on sales of $1.18 billion. For the fourth quarter of 2008, comparable segment results were operating earnings of $23.2 million on sales of $309.4 million, compared to $10.8 million on sales of $271.1 million in the same period of 2007.
Fourth quarter results were higher than the same period in 2007 due primarily to a longer and stronger than expected seasonal pack, better manufacturing performance and the favorable resolution of a $6.8 million claim.
Plastic Packaging, Americas
Plastic packaging, Americas, comparable segment results for 2008 were operating earnings of $15.8 million on sales of $735.4 million, compared to $26.3 million on sales of $752.4 million in 2007. For the fourth quarter, the segment broke even on sales of $161.4 million, compared to $9.2 million of comparable earnings on sales of $172.1 million for the same period in 2007.
Fourth quarter results were hurt by reduced sales volumes and curtailed production for inventory control purposes. The company will continue to monitor demand trends, given weaker volumes in 2008, to assess future supply and demand balance.
Aerospace and Technologies
Aerospace and technologies comparable segment results were operating earnings of $76.2 million on sales of $746.5 million in 2008, compared to $64.6 million on sales of $787.8 million in 2007. For the fourth quarter, earnings were $20.2 million on sales of $196.5 million. Fourth quarter 2007 earnings were $11.1 million on sales of $191 million. Backlog at the close of the year was $597.3 million.
Backlog declined in this segment in part as a result of pressure on the U.S. federal budget, the broader financial crisis and a slowdown in new contract awards stemming from the effects of the presidential election year. Ball reduced headcount and realigned resources to support its growing antenna and video technologies and information services such as data exploitation, systems engineering and technical support to defense and intelligence organizations. While this segment is focused on increasing backlog levels, the company expects 2009 results to decline.

Outlook
Ball expects improved free cash flow in 2009 in the range of $375 million and significantly lower interest expense due to lower debt levels and interest rates. Though the company anticipates stronger free cash flow for the year, it has elected to suspend its stock buyback program and delay capital spending for certain plant projects until global economic conditions and capital markets improve.
 Ball has no significant debt refinancing requirements until October of 2011, said Raymond J. Seabrook, executive vice president and chief financial officer. Our companys expected 2009 strong free cash flow will be used to increase liquidity, reduce debt, continue dividend payments and improve financial flexibility.
We remain positive about long-term growth opportunities in our global beverage can business, and we have responded prudently to the broader economic downturn by slowing those projects with the exception of our new joint venture metal beverage packaging plant in Brazil, where market demand requires additional capacity, Hoover said. We reduced the manufacturing footprint of our North American packaging businesses to better align supply with market demand and implemented price increases in all of our packaging operating segments to reflect the value delivered to our customers. Because of the disciplined actions we took in 2008 and the defensive nature of our businesses in this economy, Ball is well positioned to improve diluted earnings per share performance in 2009.
Ball Corporation is a supplier of high-quality metal and plastic packaging for beverage, food and household products customers, and of aerospace and other technologies and services, primarily for the U.S. government. Ball Corporation and its subsidiaries employ more than 14,500 people worldwide and reported 2008 sales of more than $7.5 billion.

2008
On October 30, 2008, the company announced the closure of two North American metal beverage can plants. A $41.7 million ($25.8 million after tax) business consolidation charge was recorded in the fourth quarter, primarily for employee severance costs, accelerated depreciation and the write down of assets to net realizable value. A gain of $10.2 million ($6.2 million after tax) was also recorded to reflect the recovery of business consolidation costs previously expensed. An additional $3 million after-tax charge is expected to be recorded in the first quarter of 2009 related to these plant closings. Cost reductions associated with these plant closings could be up to $30 million in 2009 and, inclusive of tax benefits, be $7 million cash positive upon final disposition of the assets.
In prior quarters, $20.6 million ($15.3 million after tax) was recorded for business consolidation activities primarily for the closure of two manufacturing facilities, a metal beverage packaging plant in Kent, Wash., and a plastic packaging plant in Brampton, Ontario. Also Ball Aerospace completed the sale of a subsidiary for $10.5 million that resulted in a pretax gain of $7.1 million ($4.4 million after tax).
2007
A business consolidation charge of $44.6 million ($27 million after tax) was recorded in the fourth quarter, primarily related to the announced closure of two food and household products packaging facilities. The closure of the company's facilities in Tallapoosa, Ga., and Commerce, Calif., resulted in a net reduction in manufacturing capacity of 10 production lines, including the relocation of two high-speed aerosol lines into existing Ball facilities.
In a prior quarter, the company settled a dispute with a U.S. customer in mediation for various claims for $85.6 million ($51.8 million after tax). The customer received a one-time payment of approximately $70 million in January 2008 with the remainder of the settlement to be recovered over the life of the supply contract with that customer through 2015.
A summary of the effects of the above transactions on after-tax earnings follows:
Balls management segregates the above items to evaluate the performance of the companys operations. The information is presented on a non-U.S. GAAP basis and should be considered in connection with the unaudited statements of consolidated earnings. Non-U.S. GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation.
 
 
 
In the fourth quarter of 2008, $105.5 million of net interest bearing cash collateral deposits were made on aluminum derivative hedging contracts. As these derivative hedging contracts are matched to customer sales contracts, they have little or no economic impact on our earnings but reduce aluminum price volatility for our customers. Terms of these derivative contracts may require Ball to post collateral in certain circumstances when the negative mark-to-market value of these contracts exceeds specified levels. Additionally, Ball has similar collateral posting arrangements with certain customers and financial counterparties on these hedging contracts. At December 31, 2008, Ball had $229.5 million of cash posted as collateral and had received $124 million of cash from customers for a net amount of $105.5 million. Assuming aluminum prices remain unchanged, we would expect to recover all of these cash deposits in 2009.
