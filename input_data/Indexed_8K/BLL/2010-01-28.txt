Exhibit 99.1
 
BROOMFIELD, Colo., Jan. 28, 2010Ball Corporation [NYSE:BLL] today reported its full-year 2009 net earnings of $387.9 million, or $4.08 per diluted share, on sales of $7.35 billion, compared to $319.5 million or $3.29 per diluted share, on sales of $7.56 billion in 2008.
,
Fourth quarter 2009 net earnings were $81.4 millionor 85 cents per diluted share,on sales of $1.86 billion, compared to $33.8 million, or 36 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.73 billion, in the fourth quarter of 2008.
,
 
On a comparable basis, our diluted earnings per share of 84 cents in the fourth quarter increased significantly over diluted earnings per share of 56 cents in 2008, and Balls 2009 full-year comparable results of $4.05, compared to $3.61 in the prior year, were a record for our company, said R. David Hoover, chairman and chief executive officer. Volume momentum improved sequentially in the fourth quarter in our metal beverage and metal food and household products businesses due largely to increased customer promotional activity, and the four U.S. metal beverage packaging plants acquired in October were accretive to earnings in the quarter.
Full-year 2009 and 2008 results include the effects of business consolidation activities and related items. Details of the comparable segment earnings can be found in Notes 1 and 2 to the unauditedconsolidated financial statements that accompany this news release.
 
Prior cost-cutting actions from the rationalization program that began in 2008, a disciplined approach to managing our price/cost mix and excellent plant operating performance contributed to improved 2009 results, said John A. Hayes, president and chief operating officer for the corporation. As we continue the smooth integration of the plants acquired in 2009, it is providing opportunities to improve our processes and share best practices. We remain focused on continuing to build momentum in our company.

Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas & Asia
Metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, comparable segment operating earnings were $296.0 million in 2009 on sales of $2.89 billion, compared to $284.1 million in 2008 on sales of $2.99 billion. For the fourth quarter, comparable earnings were $72.1 million on sales of $812.9 million, compared to $55.7 million on sales of $684.7 million in 2008.
Cost savings from prior plant rationalizations, the positive impact of the acquired metal beverage packaging plants and better plant efficiencies all contributed to improved results. During the fourth quarter, Ball announced an agreement to acquire a partners interest in a joint venture metal beverage can and end plant in southern China. The transaction is expected to close in 2010, subject to customary regulatory approvals. In Brazil, the companys new joint venture beverage can plant near Rio de Janeiro started up successfully in November and began supplying cans to customers.
Metal Beverage Packaging, Europe
Metal beverage packaging, Europe, segment results in 2009 were operating earnings of $214.8 million on sales of $1.74 billion, compared to $230.9 million on sales of $1.87 billion in 2008. For the fourth quarter, operating earnings in 2009 were $50.3 million on sales of $427.1 million, compared to $29.0 million on sales of $380.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Better results in the quarter were due largely to strong cost containment measures and a favorable currency conversion from a stronger euro to the U.S. dollar compared to 2008. The company continues to manage its European business to efficiently balance regional supply with customer demand.
Metal Food & Household Products Packaging, Americas
Metal food and household products packaging, Americas, comparable segment results for 2009 were operating earnings of $130.8 million on sales of $1.39 billion, compared to $68.1 million in 2008 on sales of $1.22 billion. For the fourth quarter of 2009, comparable segment results were operating earnings of $18.3 million on sales of $326.4 million, compared to $23.2 million on sales of $309.4 million in the same period of 2008. The companys fourth quarter 2008 results benefited from significant pre-buying by customers ahead of a 2009 steel price increase and the favorable resolution of a $6.8 million claim recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Exceptional plant performance, metal inventory holding gains, a disciplined approach to cost recovery and cost savings stemming from prior plant rationalizations all contributed to improved full-year results.

Plastic Packaging, Americas
Plastic packaging, Americas, comparable segment results for 2009 were operating earnings of $16.3 million on sales of $634.9 million, compared to $15.8 million on sales of $735.4 million in 2008. For the fourth quarter, comparable segment results were operating earnings of $1.1 million on sales of $136.8 million, compared to breaking even in the fourth quarter of 2008 on sales of $161.4 million.
The segment managed flat operating earnings in the quarter and for the full year despite double-digit declines in volumes and related production curtailments. During 2009 the company closed two, small PET packaging plants and consolidated that business into larger manufacturing facilities.
Aerospace and Technologies
Aerospace and technologies comparable segment results were operating earnings of $61.4 million on sales of $689.2 million in 2009, compared to $76.2 million on sales of $746.5 million in 2008. For the fourth quarter, earnings were $15.8 million on sales of $161.2 million, compared to $20.2 million on sales of $196.5 million in the quarter in 2008. Backlog at the close of the year was $517.8 million.
Pressure on the U.S. federal budget has continued to slow the contract award cycle on traditional space hardware programs, however, the number of outstanding Ball Aerospace proposals increased in the second half of the year. Increased demand for antenna and video technologies and for information services to support defense intelligence organizations contributed to second half results.
Outlook
We were pleased with our strong finish in 2009, Hoover said. While prior year inventory gains make beating last years first quarter earnings difficult, we expect full-year 2010 earnings to be above those of 2009.
In 2009, Ball generated $373 million in free cash flow after an incremental pension contribution of $14 million. The company expects 2010 free cash flow of more than half a billion dollars after capital spending of approximately $235 million.
After making a nearly $600 million acquisition, our net debt increased by only $103 million year-over-year due to our strong cash flow generation in 2009, said Scott C. Morrison, senior vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer. Credit ratios at the end of the year were better than at the start of 2009.

On October 30, 2008, the company announced the closure of two North American metal beverage can plants.
