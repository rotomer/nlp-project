Exhibit 99.1
 
 
BROOMFIELD, Colo., April 29, 2010Ball Corporation [NYSE:BLL] today reported first quarter net earnings of $79.3 million or 84 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.7 billion, compared to $69.5 million, or 73 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.6 billion in the first quarter of 2009.
,
On a comparable basis, our diluted earnings per share of 85 cents in the quarter exceeded our results of a year ago despite a challenging comparison due to the impact of significant net inventory holding gains in 2009 and unfavorable European exchange rate changes this year, said R. David Hoover, chairman and chief executive officer. The additional contribution of four metal beverage packaging plants acquired late last year, excellent operating performance, tax benefits realized on a foreign investment and continued disciplined management of our company contributed to better results. Our aerospace segment executed well in a challenging but improving contract award environment.
* Ball Corporations financial results for 2010 and 2009 are presented on both a reported GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. Reported results were prepared in accordance with generally accepted U.S. accounting principles (GAAP). Non-GAAP results exclude items described in more detail in the notes to the unaudited condensed financial statements that are part of this news release.

Details of comparable segment earnings and business consolidation activities can be found in Notes 1 and 2 to the unauditedconsolidated financial statements that accompany this news release.
 
Positive momentum in our metal can businesses continued from 2009 into 2010 and we are delivering the results we anticipated, said John A. Hayes, president and chief operating officer for the corporation. As we enter the seasonally strong quarters for our packaging businesses, we expect to continue to benefit from our past actions, the execution of our current initiatives and improving markets. Promotional activity by our customers is increasing and we see potential upside as the global economy strengthens.
 
Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas & Asia
Metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, comparable segment operating earnings were $74.0 million in the first quarter on sales of $774.4 million, compared to $46.2 million on sales of $620.4 million in the first quarter of 2009. First quarter results were higher primarily due to the impact of the U.S. plants acquired in late 2009 and the absence of higher cost inventory in the segment that occurred a year ago.
Results in China improved due to increased demand and price/cost mix. In Brazil, the joint venture beverage can plant in Tres Rios, Brazil, that started up in late 2009 is running well. Ball announced during the quarter plans to install a second line in the facility. The line is sold out in 2011 and is on track to begin production early next year. The addition of Tres Rios, as well as improved operating and financial performance in Brazil, contributed to increased equity earnings.
 
Metal Beverage Packaging, Europe
Metal beverage packaging, Europe, comparable segment results in the quarter were operating earnings of $35.0 million on sales of $367.5 million, compared to $30.9 million on sales of $343.8 million in 2009.
Continued focus on balancing supply and demand, improved volumes and the effects of disciplined cost management influenced results in the quarter. Overall market demand increased during the quarter, continuing the upward trend that began in the fourth quarter of 2009.
 
Metal Food & Household Products Packaging, Americas
Metal food and household products packaging, Americas, comparable segment results in the quarter were operating earnings of $21.7 million on sales of $285.4 million, compared to $49.6 million in 2009 on sales of $283.6 million. Comparable segment results improved excluding the effect of significant inventory holding gains in the first quarter of 2009.
Improved volumes, disciplined commercial activities and continued operational improvement contributed to better results during the seasonally slower first quarter.

Plastic Packaging, Americas
Plastic packaging, Americas, comparable segment results in the first quarter were an operating loss of $3.2 million on sales of $113.9 million, compared to operating income of $3.6 million on sales of $159.7 million in the first quarter of 2009. In addition to continued weak demand in the cold-fill PET segment, lower results were due to a qualification issue at one PET manufacturing plant and a delay in the startup of a new PET preform contract, both of which have been resolved. The segment saw stronger specialty food packaging volume and results in the quarter.
 
Aerospace and Technologies
Aerospace and technologies segment results were operating earnings of $13.5 million on sales of $165.0 million in the quarter, compared to $14.6 million on sales of $178.1 million in 2009. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $516.4 million.
Ball Aerospace continued to execute well and achieved milestones on existing contracts, including the successful integration in March of the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite weather instrument for the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System Preparatory Project. The pace of contract awards appears to be increasing and may favorably affect second half segment performance. Earlier this month, the U.S. Navy selected Ball Aerospace for the Geosat Follow-on 2 (GFO-2), the next generation ocean altimetry mission. GFO-2 measurements will be used for global ocean and tactical battlespace characterization.
 
Outlook
During the quarterBall successfully priced a public debt offering of $500 million due in 2020 and issued a notice to redeem $509 million in senior notes due in 2012, said Scott C. Morrison, senior vice president and chief financial officer. This extends our debt maturity profile and provides additional flexibility to return value to Balls shareholders through transactions such as the $125 million accelerated stock repurchase agreement announced in February.
,
 
Also, as Ball Corporation referenced during its January 2010 conference call, as a result of a new accounting pronouncement our accounts receivable securitization program was placed on the balance sheet beginning in 2010, Morrison said. Excluding the impact of this accounting change, we continue to anticipate full-year free cash flow in excess of $500 million. While the first quarter effective tax rate was 20 percent, the full-year effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 32 percent.
Details regarding the public offering, note redemption and accounting pronouncements can be found in the unauditedconsolidated financial statements that accompany this news release.
 
Our solid first quarter results, increasing customer promotion and consumer demand for our products and an improving economy combined for a positive start to the year, Hoover said. We continue to expect the companys full-year 2010 earnings to be above those of 2009.

Notes to Condensed Financials
(March 2010)
In the first quarter of 2010, a net charge of $1.7 million ($1.1 million after tax) was recorded to reflect individually insignificant costs and recoveries related to previously announced plant closures.
In the first quarter of 2009, $5 million ($3.1 million after tax) of accelerated depreciation expense was recorded in connection with a prior business consolidation charge to close Balls Kansas City, Mo., metal beverage can plant.  The Kansas City plant was closed by the end of the first quarter of 2009.
A summary of the effects of the above transaction on after-tax earnings follows:

This charge will be reported in the companys second quarter consolidated financial statements as a component of interest expense.
