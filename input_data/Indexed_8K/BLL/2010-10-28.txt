On a comparable basis, our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.40 and $3.64 for the third quarter and year-to-date improved approximately 16 and 18 percent, respectively, over the same periods in 2009, continuing the companys strong performance in 2010, said R. David Hoover, chairman and chief executive officer. Excellent operating performance within our various packaging businesses and strong program performance by our aerospace segment contributed to improved year-over-year results.
Third quarter results from continuing operations include a gain of $81.8 million, or 90 cents per diluted share, recorded in equity earnings on the companys ownership in Latapack-Ball Embalagens Ltda. (Latapack-Ball), a beverage can joint venture in Brazil, due to the consolidation of Latapack-Ball in the third quarter of 2010 as a result of the companys acquisition of an additional 10.1 percent economic interest in the joint venture. Latapack-Balls results and all related purchase accounting effects are now included in the companys metal beverage, Americas and Asia, segment. Details of comparable segment earnings and business consolidation activities can be found in Notes 2 and 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements that accompany this news release.
During the quarter, Ball completed the sale of the companys plastic packaging business, increased our investment in the growing Brazilian market, initiated the consolidation of our salmon can production capacity, acquired a metal packaging-related business to expand our product portfolio and was awarded significant new contracts in our aerospace business, said John A. Hayes, president and chief operating officer for the corporation. The strategic actions taken by the company broadened our metal packaging profile and we continue to evaluate opportunities around the world.
 
Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas & Asia
Metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, segment comparable operating earnings were $112.8 million in the third quarter on sales of $1 billion, compared to $102.9 million on sales of $706.4 million in the third quarter of 2009. For the first nine months, comparable segment operating earnings were $301.3 million on sales of $2.8 billion, compared to $223.9 million on sales of $2.1 billion during the same period in 2009.
During the quarter, Ball acquired an additional 10.1 percent economic interest in Latapack-Ball that increased Balls overall economic interest in the joint venture to 60.1 percent. Continued strong volumes in China and Brazil and increased demand for specialty cans in North America benefited segment results, while certain one-time costs and the impacts of consolidating Latapack-Ball reduced margins. Ball announced in October plans to install a second production line in North America to make Alumi-Tek bottles. Balls Golden, Colo., manufacturing plant is expected to begin making the fully reclosable and recyclable bottles in the second half of 2011.

Metal Beverage Packaging, Europe
Metal beverage packaging, Europe, segment results in the quarter were operating earnings of $63.1 million on sales of $442.3 million, compared to $68.8 million on sales of $478 million in 2009. Results for the first nine months were operating earnings of $170.6 million on sales of $1.3 billion, compared to $164.5 million on sales of $1.3 billion in 2009. Effective cost controls, continued focus on balancing supply with demand and improved volumes were more than offset by a 10 percent decline in currency translation in the quarter. The recovery of the German beverage can market continues to progress.
 
Metal Food & Household Products Packaging, Americas
Metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segment comparable results in the third quarter were operating earnings of $49.4 million on sales of $420.1 million, compared to $27.8 million in 2009 on sales of $459.5 million. Year-to-date results were operating earnings of $104.5 million on sales of $1 billion, compared to $112.5 million in 2009 on sales of $1.1 billion. Strong aerosol volumes and excellent operating performance in the quarter were partially offset by an early end to the fruit and vegetable pack in the Midwest.
Ball announced in September plans to consolidate the companys salmon can production and close a plant in Richmond, British Columbia, by the end of the first quarter of 2011. After the final disposition of the land and building, the closure is expected to be cash positive by approximately $8 million. Also during the third quarter, the company successfully completed the acquisition of Neuman Aluminum, the largest North American producer of aluminum slugs used to make extruded aerosol cans, beverage bottles, aluminum collapsible tubes and technical impact extrusions.
 
Aerospace and Technologies
Aerospace and technologies segment results were operating earnings of $18.4 million on sales of $167.9 million in the third quarter, compared to $16.2 million on sales of $168.4 million in 2009. For the first nine months, operating earnings were $50.5 million on sales of $513.1 million compared to $45.6 million on sales of $528 million during the same period last year. Strong program performance and program completion awards contributed to improved results. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $852 million.
During the third quarter, Ball Aerospace was selected to build WorldView-3, the next generation remote-sensing satellite for DigitalGlobe, and was awarded a contract by NASA for the first Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS-1) satellite. Procured by NASAs Goddard Spaceflight Center on behalf of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, JPSS-1 will ensure continuity of vital climate and weather data records. In September, the Space Based Space Surveillance satellite, built by Ball Aerospace for the U.S. Air Force, launched successfully and initial tests indicate it is functioning as expected.

Outlook
The companys balance sheet continues to strengthen, and esaid Scott C. Morrison, senior vice president and chief financial officer. We are also executing on our plan to repurchase more than $400 million of our stock in 2010.
xcluding the impact of a previously disclosed accounting change we now expect full-year free cash flow to be at least $500 million,
Ball Corporation is building significant momentum in 2010, which we expect to continue in 2011 and result in further improved performance, Hoover said. We believe our comparable second half performance from continuing operations should exceed that of the first half of 2010. The numerous strategic actions we have taken in 2010, the overall increase in demand globally for our products, our focus on balancing supply with demand and our successful execution on disciplined growth opportunities make us optimistic about Balls future.

(Latapack-Ball), through a transaction with the joint venture partner Latapack S.A., which increased the companys economic interest in the joint venture to 60.1 percent. As a result of the transaction Latapack-Ball became a variable interest entity (VIE) under consolidation accounting guidelines with Ball identified as the primary beneficiary of the VIE and consolidating the joint venture. Latapack-Ball operates metal beverage packaging manufacturing plants in Tres Rios, Jacarei and Salvador, Brazil, and is reported as part of the metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, segme nt. In the consolidation of Latapack-Ball, the company recognized an $81.8 million gain on its previously held equity investment in Latapack-Ball

Earnings of $0.5 million ($0.3 million after tax) and $0.8 million ($0.5 million after tax) were recorded in the first and second quarters of 2010, respectively, to reflect individually insignificant costs and gains primarily related to previously announced plant closures. In addition, the second quarter of 2010 included a charge of $3.1 million ($1.9 million after tax) to establish a reserve associated with an environmental matter at a previously owned facility.
In April 2010, Ball redeemed senior notes due December 2012, which resulted in a charge of $8.1 million ($4.9 million after tax) for the related call premium and write-off of unamortized financing costs and unamortized premiums.

In the third quarter, a charge of $1.0 million ($0.6 million after tax) was recorded related to winding down the closure of two North American metal beverage plants. In addition, charges of $9.1 million ($5.5 million after tax) and $2.9 million ($1.8 million after tax) were recorded in the third quarter and second quarter, respectively, for transaction c osts related to an acquisition that was finalized in the fourth quarter.
