Item 1.01
                                            
Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On November 18, 2010, Ball Corporation (the "Company") completed the sale of $500,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% senior notes due 2021 (the "2021 Notes"). The Notes were sold under the Company's shelf registration statement (Registration No. 333-157537) (the "Registration Statement").
 
The Company entered into an underwriting agreement, dated November 15, 2010 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors (the "Guarantors") and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representative of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), in connection with the issuance and sale by the Company of the 2021 Notes. The Underwriting Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants. It also provides for customary indemnification by each of the Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters against certain liabilities and customary contribution provisions in respect of those liabilities.
 
The public offering price of the 2021 Notes was 100.000% of the principal amount. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to repay the borrowings under its U.S. dollar denominated secured term loan facility (the "Term D loan facility") and for general corporate purposes, which may include potential investments in strategic alliances and acquisitions, the refinancing or repayment of debt, working capital, share repurchases or capital expenditures.
 
The 2021 Notes were issued under an Indenture, dated March 27, 2006 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (successor to The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York)), as supplemented by a Fifth Supplemental Indenture, dated November 18, 2010, among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee (the "Fifth Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"). The Indenture and the form of note, which is attached as an exhibit to the Indenture, provide, among other things, that the 2021 Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Company.
 
Interest is payable on the 2021 Notes on May 15 and November 15 of each year beginning on May 15, 2011 until their maturity date of May 15, 2021. The Company may redeem some or all of the 2021 Notes at any time prior to November 15, 2015 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes redeemed plus an applicable make-whole premium. On or after November 15, 2015, the Company may redeem some or all of the 2021 Notes at redemption prices set forth in the Fifth Supplemental Indenture. In addition, at any time prior to November 15, 2013, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes at a redemption price of 105.75% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes redeemed with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings.
 
The Company's payment obligations under the 2021 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured senior basis by certain of its current domestic subsidiaries (and will be guaranteed by certain of its future domestic subsidiaries), other than certain excluded subsidiaries and unrestricted subsidiaries. The 2021 Notes are not guaranteed by any of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.
 
The terms of the Indenture, among other things, limit in certain respects the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional debt and issue preferred stock; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; make certain investments; create liens; allow restrictions on the ability of certain of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to it; sell assets; engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions; merge or consolidate with other entities; and enter into transactions with affiliates. If the 2021 Notes are, in the future, rated investment grade by any two of Moody's Investors Services, Inc., Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Fitch Inc., certain covenants, as set forth in the Indenture, will, thereafter, no longer apply to the 2021 Notes, irrespective of whether the 2021 Notes continue to be rated investment grade.
 
Subject to certain limitations, in the event of a change of control of the Company, the Company will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2021 Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.
 
The Indenture provides for customary events of default which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among others, nonpayment of principal or interest; breach of other agreements in the Indenture; defaults in failure to pay certain other indebtedness; the failure to pay certain final judgments; the failure
 
of certain guarantees to be enforceable; and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Generally, if an event of default occurs, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding 2021 Notes may declare all the 2021 Notes to be due and payable immediately.

The Company and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company and the Guarantors shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability  or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated expressly for use therein.
 
(b)
          
Each Underwriter, severally, but not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantors against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company and the Guarantors may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or
any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated. expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company and the Guarantors for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
(c)
          
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure by the indemnified party to so notify the indemnifying party shall relieve it from the obligations to indemnify the indemnified party under such subsection only to the extent the indemnifying party suffers actual prejudice as a result of such failure, but shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection.  In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  No indemnifying party shall, (i) without the written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (1) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (2) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with the consent of the indemnifying party or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
(d)
          
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein other than by its terms, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any
person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
 
(e)
          
The obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company and the Guarantors may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer of the Company and the Guarantors and each director of the Companyand the Guarantorsand to each person, if any, who controls the Company or any Guarantor within the meaning of the Act.
 
10.
          
(a)  If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein.  If within thirty six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms.  In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary.  The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
 
(b)
          
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one twelfth of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter
agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
(c)
          
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one twelfth of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
11.
          
The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, the Guarantors and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, the Guarantors, each officer of the Company and the Guarantors and each director or controlling person of the Company and the Guarantors, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
 
12.
          
If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out of pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company and the Guarantors shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
 
13.
          
In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by you or by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated on behalf of you as the representative.

Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
 
In accordance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the underwriters are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their respective clients, including the Company, which information may include the name and address of their respective clients, as well as other information that will allow  the underwriters to properly identify their respective clients.
 
14.
          
This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company, the Guarantors and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company, the Guarantors and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
 
15.
          
Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement.  As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
 
16.
          
The Company and the Guarantors acknowledge and agree that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company and the Guarantors, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company and the Guarantors with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company or  the Guarantors on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company and the Guarantors except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company and the Guarantors have consulted their own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.  The Company and the Guarantors
agree that they will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
 
17.
          
This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) among the Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
 
18.
          
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

The Company, the Guarantors and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
 
20.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company is authorized to disclose to any persons the U.S. federal and state income tax treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Company relating to that treatment and structure, without the Underwriters, imposing any limitation of any kind. However, any information relating to the tax treatment and tax structure shall remain confidential (and the foregoing sentence shall not apply) to the extent necessary to enable any person to comply with securities laws. For this purpose, "tax structure" is limited to any facts that may be relevant to that treatment.

6.
                                      
The statements in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus under the caption "Description of Other Indebtedness," insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the documents referred to therein, fairly summarize such provisions in all material respects;

Such counsel need not express any opinion, however, as to whether the execution, delivery or performance by the Company of each of the Transaction Documents will constitute a violation of, or a default under, any covenant, restriction or provision with respect to financial ratios or tests or any aspect of the financial condition or results of operations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

11.
                                
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that under current U.S. federal income tax law, although the discussion set forth in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the heading "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" does not purport to discuss all possible U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Securities, such discussion constitutes, in all material respects, a fair and accurate summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that are anticipated to be material to holders who purchase the Securities pursuant to the Prospectus, subject to the qualifications set forth in such discussion.
 
12.
                                
Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 1 of the Underwriting Agreement, the Registration Statement became effective upon filing with the Commission pursuant to Rule 462 of the Securities Act and, pursuant to Section 309 of the Trust Indenture Act, the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act, and we have been orally advised by the Commission that no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and, to our knowledge, no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened by the Commission.

Such counsel did not participate in the preparation of the Incorporated Documents, but have, however, reviewed such documents and discussed the business and affairs of the Company with officers and other representatives of the Company. Such counsel does not pass upon, or assume responsibility for, the accuracy,
completeness or fairness of statements contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Pricing Disclosure Package and have made no independent check or verification thereof (except to the limited extent referred to in paragraphs 5, 6, 10 and 11 above).

In addition, on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to such counsel's attention that have caused such counsel to believe that the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading(except that such counsel need not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom, the report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting or the auditors' attestation report thereon, or the statements contained in the exhibits to the Registration Statement, including the Form T-1).

as representatives of the several underwriters, listed on Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have audited:
 
1.
              
the consolidated financial statements of Ball Corporation (the "Company") and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 (the "Form 10-K") and
2.
              
the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009.
 
The consolidated financial statements referred to above are all incorporated by reference in the registration statement (No. 333-157537) on Form S-3 filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act"); our report with respect thereto, which contains an explanatory paragraph on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting due to the exclusion of certain elements of the internal control over financial reporting of four Anheuser-Busch InBev's n.v./s.a. manufacturing plants ("AB InBev plants") that were acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination in 2009, is also incorporated by reference in such registration statement. Such registration statement and the preliminary prospectus supplement dated November 15, 2010 is herein referred to as the "Registration Statement."
 
In connection with the Registration Statement:
 
1.
              
We are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB").
 
2.
              
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements audited by us and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC. However, it should be noted that the Company has not retrospectively adjusted its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 to reflect the divestiture of the plastics packaging, Americas, segment as a discontinued operation in accordance with ASC 205, "Presentation of Financial Statements".
 
3.
              
We have not audited any financial statements of the Company as of any date or for any period subsequent to December 31, 2009; although we have conducted an audit for the year ended December 31, 2009, the purpose (and therefore the scope) of such audit was to enable us to express our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2009 and for the year then ended, but not on the financial statements for any interim period within such year. Therefore, we are unable to and do not express any opinion on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets and the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income and of cash flows included in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 28, 2010, June 27, 2010 and September 26, 2010 incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, or on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows as of any date or for any period subsequent to December 31, 2009. Also, we have not audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of any date subsequent to December 31, 2009. Therefore, we do not express any opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of any date subsequent to December 31, 2009.
 
4.
              
For purposes of this letter, we have read the minutes of the 2010 meetings of the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee, the Finance Committee and the Human Resources Committee of the Company and its subsidiaries as set forth in the minute books at November 12, 2010, officials of the Company having advised us that the minutes of all such meetings through that date were set forth therein, and have carried out other procedures to November 12, 2010 (our work did not extend to the period from November 13, 2010 to November 15, 2010, inclusive) as follows:
 
a.
              
With respect to the three-month periods ended March 28, 2010 and March 29, 2009, the three- and six-month periods ended June 27, 2010 and June 28, 2009 and the three- and nine-month periods ended September 26, 2010 and September 27, 2009, we have:
 
(i)
            
performed the procedures (completed on April 30, 2010, August 4, 2010 and November 3, 2010, respectively) specified by the PCAOB for a review of interim financial information as described in PCAOB AU 722, on the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three-month periods ended March 28, 2010 and March 29, 2009, as of and for the three- and six-month periods ended June 27, 2010 and June 28, 2009 and as of and for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 26, 2010 and September 27, 2009 included in the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 28, 2010, June 27, 2010 and September 26, 2010, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement; and
Interim Financial Information,
 
(ii)
         
inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters whether the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements referred to in a.(i) above comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC.
 
b.
             
With respect to the period from September 27, 2010 to October 24, 2010, we have:
 
(i)
            
read the unaudited consolidated financial data of the Company and subsidiaries for October of both 2010 and 2009 furnished us by the Company, officials of the Company
 
having advised us that no such financial data as of any date or for any period subsequent to October 24, 2010 were available. The financial information for October of both 2010 and 2009 is incomplete in that it omits the statement of cash flows and other disclosures.
 
(ii)
         
inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters as to whether the unaudited consolidated financial data referred to in b.(i) above are stated on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.
 
The foregoing procedures do not constitute an audit conducted in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. Also, they would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments in the following paragraph. Accordingly, we make no representations as to the sufficiency of the foregoing procedures for your purposes.
 
5.
              
Nothing came to our attention as a result of the foregoing procedures, however, that caused us to believe that:
 
a.    (i)
               
Any material modifications should be made to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements described in 4.a.(i), incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. However, it should be noted that the Company has not retrospectively adjusted the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 28, 2010, which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, to reflect the divestiture of the plastics packaging, Americas, segment as a discontinued operation in accordance with ASC 205, "Presentation of Financial Statements".
 
(ii)
         
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements described in 4.a.(i) do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC. However, it should be noted that the Company has not retrospectively adjusted the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 28, 2010, which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, to reflect the divestiture of the plastics packaging, Americas, segment as a discontinued operation in accordance with ASC 205, "Presentation of Financial Statements".
 
b.    (i)
              
At October 24, 2010 there was any change in the capital stock, increase in long-term debt, or decrease in consolidated net current assets (working capital) or stockholders' equity of the Company and subsidiaries consolidated as compared with amounts shown in the September 26, 2010 unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, except that the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of October 24, 2010, which we were furnished by the Company, showed the following changes from September 26, 2010 (in millions of dollars):
 
 
or (ii) for the period from September 27, 2010 to October 24, 2010, there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated net sales or in the total or per-share amounts of income before extraordinary
 
items or of net income attributable to Ball Corporation, except in all instances for changes, increases or decreases which the Registration Statement discloses have occurred or may occur.
 
6.
              
As mentioned in 4.b., Company officials have advised us that no consolidated financial data as of any date or for any period subsequent to October 24, 2010 are available; accordingly, the procedures carried out by us with respect to changes in financial statement items after October 24, 2010 have, of necessity, been even more limited than those with respect to the periods referred to in 4. We have inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters as to whether (a) at November 12, 2010 there was any change in the capital stock, increase in long-term debt, or decrease in consolidated net current assets (working capital) or stockholders' equity of the Company and subsidiaries consolidated as compared with amounts shown in the September 26, 2010 unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement; or (b) for the period from September 27, 2010 to November 12, 2010, there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated net sales or in the total or per-share amounts of income before extraordinary items or of net income attributable to Ball Corporation.
 
Those officials referred to above stated that they cannot comment on any such changes, increases or decreases in consolidated net current assets (working capital), stockholders' equity, consolidated net sales, or the total or per-share amounts of income before extraordinary items or of net income attributable to Ball Corporation for the periods referred to above.
 
On the basis of these inquiries and our reading of the minutes as described in 4, nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that there was any such change in capital stock, or increase in long-term debt, except in all instances for changes, increases or decreases which the Registration Statement discloses have occurred or may occur.
 
7.
              
For purposes of this letter, we have also read the items identified by you on the attached copy of the preliminary prospectus supplement and incorporated documents forming part of the Registration Statement and have performed the following procedures, which were applied as indicated with respect to the letters explained below. We make no comment as to whether the SEC would view any non-GAAP financial information included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement as being compliant with the requirements of Regulation G or Item 10 of Regulation S-K.
 
A
                                     
Compared with a corresponding amount included in the Company's accounting records and found such amounts to be in agreement, given the effect for rounding as applicable
 
B
                                       
Compared to or recomputed from a corresponding amount included in or derived from the Company's audited financial statements as o December 31, 2009 and 2008 and for the three years ended December 31, 2009 incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and found them to be in agreement, given the effect for rounding as applicable. Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities.

Reports by Trustee to Holders of the Notes

The Trustee also will comply with TIA Section 313(b)(2).  The Trustee will also transmit by mail all reports as required by TIA Section 313(c).
 
A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to the Holders of Notes will be mailed to the Company and filed with the SEC and each stock exchange on which the Notes are listed in accordance with TIA Section 313(d).  The Company will promptly notify the Trustee when the Notes are listed on any stock exchange or delisted therefrom.
 
Section 7.07
                           
Compensation and Indemnity
.
 
The Company and the Guarantors will pay to the Trustee from time to time such reasonable compensation as agreed upon in writing for its acceptance of this Supplemental Indenture and services hereunder.  The Trustee's
 
compensation will not be limited by any law on compensation of a Trustee of an express trust.  The Company and the Guarantors will reimburse the Trustee promptly upon request for all reasonable disbursements, advances and expenses incurred or made by it in addition to the compensation for its services.  Such expenses will include the reasonable compensation, disbursements and expenses of the Trustee's agents and counsel.
 
The Company and the Guarantors will, jointly and severally, indemnify the Trustee against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (including taxes other than taxes based upon the income of the Trustee) incurred by it arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties under this Supplemental Indenture, including the costs and expenses of enforcing this Supplemental Indenture against the Company and the Guarantors (including this Section 7.07) and defending itself against any claim (whether asserted by the Company and the Guarantors or any Holder or any other person) or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder, except to the extent any such loss, liability or expense may be attributable to its negligence or willful misconduct.  The Trustee will notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity.  Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Company will not relieve the Company and the Guarantors of its obligations hereunder.  The Company will defend the claim and the Trustee will cooperate in the defense.  The Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel.  The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.
 
The obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under this Section 7.07 shall be joint and several and will survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Supplemental Indenture.
 
To secure the Company's and the Guarantors' payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee will have a Lien prior to the Notes on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal and interest on particular Notes.  Such Lien will survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Supplemental Indenture.
 
When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(g) or (h) hereof occurs, the expenses and the compensation for the services (including the fees and expenses of its agents and counsel) are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.
 
The Trustee will comply with the provisions of TIA Section 313(b)(2) to the extent applicable.

Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may appoint a successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Company.
 
If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Company, or the Holders of Notes of at least 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may petition at the expense of the Company any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
 
If the Trustee, after written request by any Holder of a Note who has been a Holder of a Note for at least six months, fails to comply with Section 7.10, such Holder of a Note may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.
 
A successor Trustee will deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company.  Thereupon, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee will become effective, and the successor Trustee will have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Supplemental Indenture.  The successor Trustee will mail a notice of its succession to Holders of the Notes.  The retiring Trustee will promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, all sums owing to the Trustee (including its agents and/or counsel) hereunder have been paid and subject to the Lien provided for in Section 7.07 hereof.

Except as provided below in this Section 9.02, the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Supplemental Indenture (including Sections 3.09, 4.10 and 4.15 hereof), the Guarantees and the Notes with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the Notes, and, subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof) and any existing Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes, except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of this Supplemental Indenture, the Guarantees or the Notes may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the Notes).  Section 2.08 hereof will determine which Notes are considered to be "outstanding" for purposes of this Section 9.02.
 
Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of its Board of Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders of Notes as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.02 hereof, the Trustee will join with the Company in the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture unless such amended or supplemental indenture directly affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Supplemental Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but will not be obligated to, enter into such amended or supplemental indenture.
 
 
It will not be necessary for the consent of the Holders of Notes under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it will be sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment or waiver.
 
After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section becomes effective, the Company will mail to the Holders of Notes affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver.  Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, will not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental indenture or waiver.  Subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding voting as a single class may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company with any provision of this Supplemental Indenture or the Notes.  However, without the consent of each Holder of Notes affected, an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder):
 
(a)
                                 
reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
 
(b)
                                
reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or alter or waive any of the provisions with respect to the redemption of the Notes except as provided above with respect to Sections 3.09, 4.10 and 4.15 hereof;
 
(c)
                                 
reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on any Note;
 
(d)
                                
waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes, except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration:
 
(e)
                                 
make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes;
 
(f)
                                   
make any change in the provisions of this Supplemental Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders of the Notes to receive payments of principal of or premium, interest on the Notes;
 
(g)
                                
make any change in the foregoing amendment and waiver provisions; or
 
(h)
                                
release any Guarantor from any of its Obligations under its Guarantee or this Supplemental Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of this Supplemental Indenture.
 
Section 9.03
                           
Compliance With Trust Indenture Act
.
 
Every amendment or supplement to this Supplemental Indenture or the Notes will be set forth in a amended or supplemental indenture that complies with the TIA as then in effect.
 
Section 9.04
                           
Revocation and Effect of Consents
.
 
Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing consent by the Holder of a Note and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note.  However, any such Holder of a Note or subsequent Holder of a Note may revoke the consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the waiver, supplement or amendment becomes effective.  An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder.
 
 
Section 9.05
                           
Notation on or Exchange of Notes
.
 
The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment, supplement or waiver on any Note thereafter authenticated.  The Company in exchange for all Notes may issue and the Trustee will, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, authenticate new Notes that reflect the amendment, supplement or waiver.
 
Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note will not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.
 
Section 9.06
                           
Trustee to Sign Amendments, Etc.
 
The Trustee will sign any amended, restated or supplemental indenture authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee.  The Company may not sign an amendment or supplemental indenture until the Board of Directors approves it.  In executing any amended, restated or supplemental indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to receive and (subject to Section 7.01 hereof) will be fully protected in relying upon, in addition to the documents required by Section 12.04 hereof, an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amended, restated or supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Supplemental Indenture.
 
Section 10.01
                    
Guarantee
.
 
Subject to this Article 10, each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Supplemental Indenture, the Notes or the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder, that:  (a) the principal of and interest on the Notes will be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of and interest on the Notes, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder will be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and (b) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other obligations, that same will be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise.  Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Guarantors will be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately.  Each Guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment and not a guarantee of collection.
 
The Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder will be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or this Supplemental Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor.  Each Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenant that this Guarantee will not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and this Supplemental Indenture.
 
If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, the Guarantors or any custodian, Trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or the Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, will be reinstated in full force and effect.
 
Each Guarantor agrees that it will not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby.  Each
 
Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 hereof for the purposes of this Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article 6 hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) will forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Guarantee.  The Guarantors will have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Guarantee.
 
Section 10.02
                    
Limitation on Guarantor Liability
.
 
Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Notes, each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Guarantee of such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any Guarantee.  To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Guarantor under its Guarantee and this Article 10 will be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article 10, result in the obligations of such Guarantor under its Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
 
Section 10.03
                    
Execution and Delivery of Guarantee
.
 
To evidence its Guarantee set forth in Section 10.01, each Guarantor hereby agrees that a notation of such Guarantee substantially in the form included in will be endorsed by an Officer of such Guarantor on each Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and that this Supplemental Indenture will be executed on behalf of such Guarantor by an Officer.
Exhibit C
 
Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its Guarantee set forth in Section 10.01 will remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Note a notation of such Guarantee.
 
If an Officer whose signature is on this Supplemental Indenture or on the Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note on which a Guarantee is endorsed, the Guarantee will be valid nevertheless.
 
The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, will constitute due delivery of the Guarantee set forth in this Supplemental Indenture on behalf of the Guarantors.
 
In the event that the Company creates or acquires any new Subsidiaries subsequent to the date of this Supplemental Indenture, if required by Section 4.16 hereof, the Company will cause such Subsidiaries to execute supplemental indentures to this Supplemental Indenture and Guarantees in accordance with Section 4.16 hereof and this Article 10, to the extent applicable.

A Guarantor may not sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to, or consolidate with or merge with or into, whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving Person, another Person other than the Company or another Guarantor, unless:
 
(a)
                                 
immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and
 
(b)
                                
either:
 
(1)
                                 
the Person acquiring the property in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger, if other than the Guarantor or the Company, unconditionally assumes all the obligations of such Guarantor under this Supplemental Indenture and its Guarantee pursuant to a supplemental indenture in the form of hereto; or
Exhibit C
 
(2)

Such successor Person thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the Guarantees to be endorsed upon all of the Notes issuable hereunder.  All the Guarantees so issued will in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Supplemental Indenture as the Guarantees theretofore and thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Supplemental Indenture as though all of such Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.

Upon any such consolidation or merger of any Guarantor with or into another Guarantor or with or into the Company, the Guarantee of the Guarantor that does not survive will no longer be of any force or effect.

(c)           Except as set forth in Articles 4 and 5 and Section 10.05 of Article 10 of the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, and notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above, nothing contained in the Fifth Supplemental Indenture or in any of the Notes will prevent any consolidation or merger of a Guarantor with or into the Company or another Guarantor, or will prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of a Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Company or another Guarantor.
 
5.             Releases.
 
(a)           In the event of any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of any Guarantor, by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, or a sale or other disposition of all of the capital stock of any Guarantor, in each case to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) a Subsidiary of the Company, then such Guarantor (in the event of a sale or other disposition, by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, of all of the capital stock of such Guarantor) or the corporation acquiring the property (in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor) will be released and relieved of any obligations under its Note Guarantee; that such sale or other disposition does not violate the applicable provisions of the Supplemental Indenture, including without limitation Section 4.10 of the Fifth Supplemental Indenture.  Upon delivery by the Company to the Trustee of an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such sale or other disposition was made by the Company in accordance with the provisions of the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, including without limitation Section 4.10 of the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, the Trustee will execute any documents reasonably required in order to evidence the release of any Guarantor from its obligations under its Note Guarantee.
provided
(b)           Any Guarantor not released from its obligations under its Note Guarantee will remain liable for the full amount of principal of and interest on the Notes and for the other obligations of any Guarantor under the Fifth Supplemental Indenture as provided in Article 10 of the Fifth Supplemental Indenture.
 
6.             .  No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, stockholder or agent of the Guaranteeing Subsidiary, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Company or any Guaranteeing Subsidiary under the Notes, any Note Guarantees, the Indenture or this Supplemental Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation.  Each Holder of the Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability.  The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes.  Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.
No Recourse Against Others

.  THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WILL GOVERN AND BE USED TO CONSTRUE THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE BUT WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY.
