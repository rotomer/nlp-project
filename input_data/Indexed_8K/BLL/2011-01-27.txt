On January 27, 2011, Ball Corporation (the Company) issued a press release announcing its fourth quarter and full year earnings for 2010, which results are set forth in the press release dated January 27, 2011, and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
Earnings information regarding the fourth quarter and full year 2010, as well as information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures, are set forth in the attached press release.
The information in this Report shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the Exchange Act) or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
On January 25, 2011, the Company issued a press release, attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2, announcing the closure of its beverage can plant in Torrance, California. As a result of the closure, an after-tax charge of approximately $12.4 million will be recorded in the Companys results. The charge includes $9.6 million for employee severance, pension and other employee benefit costs, $6 million for equipment removal and cleanup costs and $4.9 million primarily related to estimated losses on the sale of certain fixed assets, accelerated depreciation and the write-down to net realizable value of certain fixed assets and related spare parts and inventory. These charges will be offset by tax recoveries of approximately $8.1 million. Approximately $6.4 million, after tax, of the charge is expected to be recorded in the first quarter of 2011, with the remainder recorded by the end of the fourth quarter of 2011. The closure is expected to be cash flow positive to the Company upon final settlement of all closure-related costs and dispositions of all assets and will result in significant fixed cost savings to the Company.
On January 26, 2011, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split of the Companys common stock, increased the quarterly cash dividend and authorized the repurchase of up to a total of 10 million shares of common stock, being 20 million post-split shares.
The distribution date for the stock split will be February 15, 2011, for shareholders of record on February 4, 2011. Such shareholders will be issued one additional share of common stock of the Company for each share of common stock of the Company owned on that date. Such distribution of common stock of the Company will be made by book entry. The Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 14 cents per share, being 7 cents per post-split share, payable March 15, 2011, to shareholders of record on March 1, 2011, which represents an increase of 40 percent over the quarterly dividend of 10 cents per pre-split share. The Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10 million shares of common stock, being 20 million post-split shares. The repurchase authorizatio n replaces all previous authorizations. For additional information regarding this announcement, refer to Exhibit 99.3 filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K.

officer. Our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share, adjusted for the impact of the tax benefit of 13 cents, were 93 cents, an increase over 83 cents a year ago.
Full-year 2010 and 2009 results include the effects of business consolidation activities and related items. Details of the comparable segment earnings can be found in the notes to the unauditedconsolidated financial statements that accompany this news release.
 
Ball announced yesterday a two-for-one split of the companys common stock, effective Feb. 15 to shareholders of record on Feb. 4, and a 40 percent increase in the companys quarterly cash dividend, payable March 15 to shareholders of record on March 1. Balls board also authorized the repurchase of up to 20 million of the companys post-split shares.
Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas & Asia
Metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, comparable segment operating earnings were $418.3 million in 2010 on sales of $3.8 billion, compared to $296.0 million in 2009 on sales of $2.9 billion. For the fourth quarter, comparable earnings were $117.0 million on sales of $1.0 billion, compared to $72.1 million on sales of $812.9 million in 2009. The consolidation of our Brazilian joint venture into the companys financial results, double-digit volume growth in China and Brazil and excellent operating performance drove improved results.
Ball announced on Tuesday the planned closure of its Torrance, Calif., beverage can plant as part of a reduction of 12-ounce can capacity. The company also announced it will expand specialty beverage can production in its Fort Worth, Texas, plant. These actions better align Balls manufacturing footprint with demand and increase operational efficiencies.
Metal Beverage Packaging, Europe
Metal beverage packaging, Europe, comparable segment results in 2010 were operating earnings of $212.9 million on sales of $1.7 billion, compared to $214.8 million on sales of $1.7 billion in 2009.

Single-digit volume growth partially offset the negative effects of a lower year-over-year Euro exchange rate, unfavorable weather conditions in fourth quarter and lower exports. The German beverage can market continued its steady growth as more retail outlets stocked cans. Earlier this month, Ball completed its acquisition of Aerocan S.A.S., a leading supplier of extruded aluminum aerosol cans and bottles in Europe.

During the quarter, the STPSat-2 satellite, built by Ball Aerospace for the U.S. Air Force, lifted off successfully from Alaska. It is the first spacecraft in Balls STP Standard Interface Vehicle product line, and is compatible with multiple launch vehicles and supports a variety of experimental and risk reduction payloads at different low-Earth orbits.

Ball Aerospace developed the Kepler flight system and supports mission operations with the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado in Boulder.
 
Outlook
During 2010 we extended the companys debt profile and achieved favorable terms on our borrowing facility, resulting in a very competitive capital structure that provides greater flexibility to grow our business and return capital to our shareholders, said Scott C. Morrison, senior vice president and chief financial officer. We expect to generate at least $400 million in free cash flow in 2011 after investing in key projects to respond to organic and emerging market growth opportunities, and the majority of our free cash flow will be used to repurchase stock.

During August 2010, the company paid $46.2 million to acquire an additional 10.1 percent economic interest in its Brazilian beverage packaging joint venture, Latapack-Ball Embalagens Ltda. (Latapack-Ball), through a transaction with the joint venture partner, Latapack S.A., which increased the companys economic interest in the joint venture to 60.1 percent. As a result of the transaction, Latapack-Ball became a variable interest entity (VIE) under consolidation accounting guidelines with Ball identified as the primary beneficiary of the VIE and consolidating the joint venture. Latapack-Ball operates metal beverage packaging manufacturing plants in Tres Rios, Jacarei and Salvador, Brazil, and is reported as part of the metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, seg ment. In the consolidation of Latapack-Ball, the company recognized an $81.8 million gain on its previously held equity investment in Latapack-Ball
In June 2010, the company acquired Guangdong Jianlibao Group Co., Ltds (Jianlibao) 65-percent interest in a joint venture metal beverage can and end plant in Sanshui, PRC.

The third quarter of 2010 also included other individually insignificant costs of $1.6 million ($1.0 million after tax).
Earnings of $0.5 million ($0.3 million after tax) and $0.8 million ($0.5 million after tax) were recorded in the first and second quarters of 2010, respectively, to reflect individually insignificant costs and gains primarily related to previously announced plant closures. In addition, the second quarter of 2010 included a charge of $3.1 million ($1.9 million after tax) to establish a reserve associated with an environmental matter at a previously owned facility.

In the third quarter, a charge of $1.0 million ($0.6 million after tax) was recorded related to winding down the closure of two North American metal beverage plants.

Exhibit 99.2
BROOMFIELD, Colo., Jan. 25, 2011Ball Corporation [NYSE: BLL] announced today several actions to decrease the companys overall installed beverage can capacity in North America while better aligning Balls manufacturing footprint to meet changing customer demand.
Ball will close its Torrance, Calif., beverage can plant by the end of the third quarter of 2011, subject to customer requirements. The 45-year-old plant employs approximately 120 people and operates three lines, two that produce 12-ounce cans and one that produces 16-ounce cans. One of the 12-ounce production lines from Torrance will be relocated to Balls Whitby, Ontario, beverage can plant and is scheduled to start up during the second quarter of 2011.
Ball expects to record a total after-tax charge of approximately $12.4 million in 2011, primarily for employee severance and pensions and facility clean-up costs, of which $6.4 million is expected to be recorded in the first quarter of 2011. The closure is expected to be cash flow positive to Ball upon final settlement of all closure-related costs and disposition of all assets and will result in significant fixed cost savings to the company.
Ball, the largest producer of specialty beverage cans in North America, will also expand specialty beverage can production in its Fort Worth, Texas, plant. Ball supplies to its customers beverage cans in more than 20 sizes as well as other beverage can innovations. A new line in Fort Worth

will make 16- and 24-ounce specialty cans and is expected to begin production by the beginning of the third quarter of 2011.
These actions support our strategy of growing Balls beverage can business while better aligning our manufacturing footprint with changing market demand and increasing operational efficiencies, said Raymond J. Seabrook, executive vice president and chief operating officer, global packaging. The strong demand for specialty cans, especially for beer, teas, energy drinks and other beverages, continues to drive volume for Ball. The output of the Whitby and Fort Worth lines is contracted to customers under multi-year agreements.
Torrance employees will be provided severance and outplacement services, and will be able to apply for open positions within Ball.
