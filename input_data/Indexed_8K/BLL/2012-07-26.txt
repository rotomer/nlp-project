Exhibit 99.1
Ball Reports Improved Second Quarter Results
BROOMFIELD, Colo., July 26, 2012Ball Corporation (NYSE:BLL) today reported second quarter net earnings attributable to the corporation of $139.5 million, or 88 cents per diluted share, on sales of $2.3 billion, compared to $143.1 million, or 84 cents per diluted share, on sales of $2.3 billion in the second quarter of 2011. Results for the first six months of 2012 were net earnings attributable to the corporation of $227.8 million, or $1.42 per diluted share, on sales of $4.3 billion, compared to $234.4 million, or $1.37 cents per diluted share, on sales of $4.3 billion in the first six months of 2011.
Comparable 2012 earnings per diluted share for the second quarter and year-to-date were 89 cents and $1.52, respectively versus second quarter and year-to-date 2011 comparable earnings per diluted share of 85 cents and $1.43, respectively.
Details of comparable segment earnings and business consolidation activities can be found in Notes 1 and 2 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements that accompany this news release.
Our improved second quarter and first half results reflect the continued successful execution of our Drive for 10 strategy and our focus on returning value to our shareholders, said John A. Hayes, president and chief executive officer.
Our new beverage can plants in China, Brazil and Vietnam will contribute favorably to our results during the second half of 2012, said Raymond J. Seabrook, executive vice president and chief operating officer, global packaging. Emerging market and specialty can volume growth during the quarter offset flat volumes in North America and the financial impact of a lower euro.
 
 
 
Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas & Asia
Metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, comparable segment operating earnings were $136.8 million in the second quarter on sales of $1.2 billion, compared to $126.1 million on sales of $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2011. For the first six months, comparable segment operating earnings were $242.3 million on sales of $2.3 billion, compared to $241.7 million on sales of $2.2 billion during the same period in 2011.
Increased demand for specialty packaging in the U.S., especially for Ball's Alumi-Tek bottle, partially offset continued weaker demand for standard 12-ounce cans in North America. Volumes in Brazil and China through the first half of 2012 are up low-double digits and are expected to continue to grow in the second half of the year as new plants supply market demand.
Metal Beverage Packaging, Europe
Metal beverage packaging, Europe, results in the second quarter were comparable segment operating earnings of $65.7 million on sales of $556.2 million, compared to $84.7 million on sales of $607.9 million in 2011. Results for the first six months were comparable segment operating earnings of $119.4 million on sales of $1.0 billion, compared to $137.8 million on sales of $1.1 billion in 2011.
European beverage can volumes increased low-single digits in the quarter and through the first half. Extruded aluminum aerosol volumes also increased through the first six months compared to the same period last year. The earnings translation effect of a lower Euro was the primary factor in lower segment earnings in the quarter.
Metal Food & Household Products Packaging, Americas
Metal food and household products packaging, Americas, results in the second quarter were comparable segment operating earnings of $31.9 million on sales of $327.6 million, compared to $41.3 million in 2011 on sales of $345.7 million. Year-to-date results were comparable segment operating earnings of $59.9 million on sales of $658.0 million, compared to $81.1 million on sales of $690.4 million in 2011.
 
First half results were lower versus the same period in 2011 due to the absence of inventory holding gains from a year ago and weaker food can volumes, partially offset by improved results in the company's extruded aluminum slug business and better segment manufacturing performance
.
 
 
 
 
Aerospace and Technologies
Aerospace and technologies results were comparable segment operating earnings of $20.2 million on sales of $210.3 million in the second quarter, compared to $21.7 million on sales of $199.9 million in 2011. For the first six months, comparable segment operating earnings were $39.9 million on sales of $411.9 million compared to $40.4 million on sales of $391.1 million during the same period last year. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $780.4 million.
During the quarter, the B612 Foundation, a nonprofit organization, announced that Ball Aerospace will build a space telescope that will scan the solar system for asteroids posing a threat to Earth. This will be the first privately funded deep-space mission. Also during the quarter, DigitalGlobe announced continued government support for the Ball-built WorldView satellites through Aug. 31, 2013.
Outlook
Full year 2012 free cash flow is now expected to be at least a half a billion dollars as we reduce growth capital spending plans to better align with recent global trends, said Scott C. Morrison, senior vice president and chief financial officer. The majority of 2012 free cash flow is expected to be returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
After a very good first half which was slightly above our expectations, we remain on track to achieve our goal of 10 to 15 percent diluted earnings per share growth for the full year, Hayes said. We continue to anticipate a stronger second half compared to the first half of 2012 as new, emerging market plants contribute positively to our results, and the food and household and Brazilian businesses enter their busiest seasons.
