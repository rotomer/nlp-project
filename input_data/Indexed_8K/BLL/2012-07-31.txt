Item 1.01 Entry into Amendment to a Material Definitive Agreement.
On July 31, 2012, Ball Corporation and its subsidiary, Ball European Holdings, S.a r.l., finalized the First Amendment to Credit Agreement (the First Amendment) with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as administrative agent and as collateral agent, and the lenders signatory thereto.
The First Amendment revises that certain Credit Agreement dated as of December 21, 2010 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified and in effect from time to time, the Credit Agreement), pursuant to which the Lenders (as defined in the Credit Agreement) have provided to Borrowers (as defined in the Credit Agreement) credit facilities and other financial accommodations.
The First Amendment and the related Joinder Agreement were entered into in order to reflect the addition and the deletion of various legal entities as Borrowers, primarily as a result of the relocation of Balls European headquarters to Switzerland, and to ensure compliance with Swiss laws and regulations.
The First Amendment also reflects modifications which will benefit Ball, including increasing various covenant baskets that are available to the company.
