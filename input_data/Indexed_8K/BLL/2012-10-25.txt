Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas & Asia

While sales volumes in North America were relatively flat year to date compared to last year, a continued focus on controlling costs and growth in specialty packaging contributed to higher comparable segment operating earnings in the third quarter and for the first nine months compared to 2011. Year-to-date sales volumes in Brazil and China grew by approximately 15 percent, with new plants in Alagoinhas, Brazil, and Qingdao, China, contributing to improved results.

Comparable European third quarter operating results on a euro basis were up 8 percent, however, on a US dollar basis were lower due to a weaker euro exchange rate.

Year-to-date results were comparable segment operating earnings of $102.5 million on sales of $1.1 billion, compared to $120.6 million on sales of $1.1 billion in 2011. Segment volumes for the first nine months were down high single digits vs. 2011, due primarily to the impact of the Midwest drought on the seasonal fruit and vegetable harvest. Year-to-date segment earnings were below last year due to inventory gains made in 2011 that were not realized in 2012.

The acquisition will provide a platform to grow Balls North American extruded aluminum packaging business, while the joint venture will leverage the combined strengths of the two companies aerosol can businesses in Argentina and Brazil. The acquisition is expected to close later this year, subject to certain closing conditions and regulatory approvals.
