ITEM 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits. (c) The following exhibit is being furnished herewith: 99 News Release, dated April 24, 2003, of BMC Software, Inc. ITEM 9. Regulation FD Disclosure BMC Software, Inc. (the "Company") will hold a conference call on April 24, 2003 to discuss its fiscal fourth quarter results and to provide the following fiscal 2004 guidance. Such guidance is based on management's current expectations or beliefs, and is subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. These statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. The Company expects first quarter revenues to be in the range of $320 million to $335 million and earnings per share ("EPS") excluding special items to be in the range of 5 to 10 cents. The Company expects first quarter EPS on a GAAP basis to be in the range of 0 to 5 cents. The difference between these two estimates is that EPS excluding special items excludes an estimated $15.8 million in amortization of intangibles related to various acquisitions completed to date and the related tax effect. The Company expects fiscal 2004 EPS excluding special items to be in the range of 52 to 60 cents. The Company expects fiscal 2004 EPS on a GAAP basis to be in the range of 34 to 42 cents. The difference between these two estimates is that EPS excluding special items excludes an estimated $59.4 million in amortization of intangibles related to various completed acquisitions and the related tax effect. The GAAP EPS outlook above does not include the impact of any charges related to future events such as acquisitions. The Company expects net deferred license revenues for fiscal 2004 to increase by $20 million to $40 million. The Company expects its fiscal 2004 cash flow to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by the statements herein due to changes in economic, business, competitive, technological and/or regulatory factors, sales of business assets, and the potential impact of future decisions by management that may result in merger and restructuring charges, as well as the potential impact of any future impairment charges to goodwill or other intangible assets. The Company's statements regarding financial expectations are forward-looking statements. Numerous important factors affect BMC Software's operating results and could cause BMC Software's actual results to differ materially from the results indicated by these statements of expectations, and there can be no assurance that future results will meet expectations, estimates or projections. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 1) uncertainty regarding future economic conditions worldwide may continue to affect the overall demand for software and services and any worsening of significant economies could result in decreased revenues or lower revenue growth rates; 2) BMC Software's revenues and earnings are subject to a number of factors, including the significant percentage of quarterly sales typically closed at the end of each quarter, that make estimation of operating results prior to the end of a quarter extremely uncertain; 3) BMC Software's operating costs and expenses are relatively fixed over the short term; 4) increased competition and pricing pressures could adversely affect BMC Software's earnings; 5) growth in 2
BMC Software's mainframe revenues is dependent on continued demand for significant additional mainframe MIPS capacity; 6) BMC Software's maintenance revenue could decline if maintenance renewal rates decline or if license revenues do not continue to grow; 7) new software products and product strategies may not be timely introduced or successfully adopted; 8) BMC Software's cash flow from operations is and has been volatile and is dependent upon a number of factors described in BMC Software's filings with the SEC; 9) the additional risks and important factors described in BMC Software's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in its Annual Report to Stockholders on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002 and other filings with the SEC. The following information, furnished under this "Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure," is intended to be furnished under "Item 12. Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" in accordance with SEC Release No. 33-8216. Such information, including the Exhibit attached hereto, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

[NYSE: BMC] today announced financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter, ended March 31, 2003. BMC Software's net earnings excluding special items for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 were $38.9 million, or $0.17 per diluted common share, an increase of $0.05 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and $0.01 over the current analyst consensus of $0.16. Fourth quarter fiscal 2003 net earnings on a GAAP basis were $20.6 million or $0.09 per diluted common share, which compares to a net loss of $1.8 million or $0.01 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Included in the financial tables is a reconciliation of results excluding special items and GAAP results. "We met our fourth quarter revenue and earnings goals and generated $606 million in operating cash flow for the year, despite the economic uncertainty that continued to affect IT purchases during the quarter. We achieved these results by staying focused on our customers and by competing strongly in the marketplace," said Bob Beauchamp, president and CEO, BMC Software. "As we begin our new fiscal year, BMC will maintain this focus while advancing our recently announced Business Service Management strategy to enable customers to move beyond traditional IT management and allow them to manage their business from both an IT and a business perspective." Total revenues in the fourth fiscal quarter were $380.7 million, an increase of 15 percent compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2002. Total license revenues in the quarter increased to $180.8 million, up 12 percent, compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2002.

Operating expenses, excluding $24.1 million of special items, were $336.5 million, compared to $302.0 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2002. These results reflect Remedy's operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Total revenues for Remedy in the fourth quarter were $49.2 million and expenses were $42.7 million, excluding $12.0 million of amortization of intangibles.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This press release includes financial measures for net earnings, earnings per share (EPS) and operating expenses that exclude certain charges and therefore have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A detailed reconciliation between the GAAP results and non-GAAP results is included with the financial tables accompanying this press release. BMC Software has provided these non-GAAP measures in its press releases reporting historical financial results because the company believes these measures provide a consistent basis for comparison between quarters, which are not influenced by certain non-cash or non-recurring expenses and are therefore useful to investors in helping them understand the financial condition of BMC Software by focusing on the performance of its core operations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate the performance of its various businesses and as a key variable in determining management compensation. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP, and these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to information provided by other companies.
