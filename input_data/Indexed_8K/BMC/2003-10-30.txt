[NYSE: BMC] today announced financial results for its fiscal 2004 second quarter ended September 30, 2003. BMC Software's net earnings excluding special items for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 were $22.2 million, or $0.10 per diluted common share, which compares to net earnings excluding special items of $19.3 million, or $0.08 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2003. This exceeds the $0.04 to $0.06 per share range that the company provided in July and the current analyst consensus estimate of $0.05 per share. The fiscal 2004 second quarter net loss on a GAAP basis was $13.2 million, or a loss of $0.06 per share, which compares to net earnings of $10.1 million, or $0.04 per share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2003. Included in the financial tables is a reconciliation of results excluding special items and GAAP results. "I am pleased with our results in the second quarter as we exceeded our earnings per share and revenue estimates. Our PATROL(R) and Distributed Systems Data Management product lines both reported sequential and year-over-year license revenue growth," said Bob Beauchamp, president and CEO, BMC Software. "Our Remedy business is outperforming our revenue and earnings expectations quarter after quarter and has been a significant contributor to our bottom line. Remedy is an integral piece of our Business Service Management (BSM) strategy that is continuing to gain momentum as customers and partners alike recognize its value." Total revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 were $333.8 million, an increase of 15 percent compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2003. Total license revenues in the quarter were $124.7 million, an increase of 4 percent compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2003. Maintenance revenues were $188.2 million, an increase of 25 percent, compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2003. Professional services revenues were $20.9 million, an increase of 5 percent compared to the same quarter last year. Operating expenses, excluding $15.3 million of amortization of intangibles and $34.4 million related to restructuring efforts, were $320.8 million, compared to $281.5 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2003. These results include Remedy's operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Total revenues for Remedy in the second quarter were $60.3 million and expenses were $39.2 million, excluding $12.0 million of amortization of intangibles. BMC Software maintained its strong financial position with cash flow from operations in the quarter of $34.1 million, including $18.5 million in restructuring charges. At quarter-end, the cash and marketable securities balance was $1.04 billion and the total deferred revenue balance was $1.14 billion. BMC Software continued its stock repurchase program by spending $30 million to repurchase 2.1 million shares during the second fiscal quarter. Approximately $387 million remains in this program.
BMC SOFTWARE EXCEEDS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS AND REVENUE ESTIMATES /PAGE 2 SECOND QUARTER FY04 BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS *Remedy was acquired in November 2002. RESTRUCTURING UPDATE The restructuring effort that the company announced in July is proceeding as planned. The company continues to expect that the restructuring will result in annual cost savings of $100 million to $120 million. The charges related to the restructuring were $34.4 million in the second quarter and were primarily associated with personnel related actions. BMC Software expects a $68 million to $73 million charge in the third quarter as downsizing and disposition of its facilities worldwide are completed. THIRD QUARTER AND FISCAL 2004 GUIDANCE BMC Software expects high single digit revenue growth in the third quarter compared to the second quarter and earnings per share excluding special items to be in the $0.15 to $0.20 range. For fiscal 2004, the company is raising its guidance for earnings per share excluding special items to be in the $0.48 to $0.53 range. Third quarter estimates do not include an estimated $0.05 per share of amortization of acquired technology and intangibles, and an estimated $0.20 to $0.21 per share related to restructuring charges. Fiscal 2004 estimates do not include an estimated $0.19 of amortization of acquired technology and intangibles, and an estimated $0.30 to $0.31 per share related to restructuring charges.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This press release includes financial measures for net earnings, earnings per share (EPS) and operating expenses that exclude certain charges and therefore have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A detailed reconciliation between the GAAP results and results excluding special items (non-GAAP) is included with the financial tables accompanying this press release. BMC Software has provided these non-GAAP measures in its press releases reporting historical financial results because the company believes these measures provide a consistent basis for comparison between quarters, as they are not influenced by certain non-cash or non-recurring expenses and are therefore useful to investors in helping them understand the financial condition of BMC Software by focusing on the performance of its core operations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate the company's performance and as a key variable in determining management compensation. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP, and these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to information provided by other companies.
