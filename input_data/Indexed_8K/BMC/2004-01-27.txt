[NYSE: BMC] today announced financial results for its fiscal 2004 third quarter ended December 31, 2003. BMC Software's net earnings excluding special items for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 were $43.0 million, or $0.19 per diluted common share, which compares to net earnings excluding special items of $34.6 million, or $0.15 per share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. This exceeded the current analyst consensus estimate of $0.17 per share and is at the high end of the $0.15 to $0.20 per share range the company provided in October. The fiscal 2004 third quarter net loss on a GAAP basis was $44.4 million, or a loss of $0.20 per share, which compares to net earnings of $12.1 million, or $0.05 per share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. The $87.4 million difference between third quarter earnings excluding special items and GAAP earnings is $12.2 million in amortization of intangibles related to various acquisitions and $75.2 million in restructuring charges including the related tax effects. Included in the financial tables is a reconciliation of results excluding special items and GAAP results. "BMC Software's strong third quarter performance is a testament to our strategic focus and solid execution," said Bob Beauchamp, president and CEO, BMC Software. "From a financial perspective, we met or exceeded all our goals for the quarter, including revenues, earnings per share and cash flow from operations. License bookings, excluding Remedy, grew 23 percent compared to the same quarter last year as we benefited from an improving IT spending environment and solid execution. The Remedy business unit continues to generate strong revenue growth and high operating margins. From a strategic perspective, our Business Service Management strategy continues to gain momentum as customers and partners alike are embracing its value to empower IT organizations to manage their IT elements and services from a business perspective in a consistent, comprehensive and integrated fashion." Total revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 were $374.8 million, an increase of 12 percent compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2004. This exceeded the current consensus estimate of $359 million and the guidance of high single digit sequential growth that the company provided in October. Operating expenses, excluding $14.5 million of amortization of intangibles and $89.6 million related to restructuring efforts, were $332.1 million, compared to $313.3 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2003. Total revenues for Remedy in the third quarter were $69.8 million and expenses were $45.0 million, excluding $12.0 million of amortization of intangibles. BMC Software maintained its strong financial position with cash flow from operations in the quarter of $74.3 million. At quarter-end, the cash and marketable securities balance was $1.06 billion and the total deferred revenue balance was a record $1.23 billion.
BMC Software continued its stock repurchase program by spending $30 million to repurchase 1.8 million shares during the third fiscal quarter. Approximately $357 million remains in this program. LICENSE BOOKINGS Given the record $73.7 million net increase in deferred license revenues during the quarter, the company is introducing a new metric called license bookings that reflects the amount of license contracts signed during a given quarter. This new license bookings metric includes both the amount that goes to the income statement and the amount that goes to the deferred license revenue account on the balance sheet. As license bookings measure new contracts that are signed in a given quarter, this metric provides a clear measurement of the company's current sales performance. License bookings can be calculated by adding license revenues to the net change in the deferred license revenue balance, as illustrated below. THIRD QUARTER FY04 BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS * Remedy was acquired in November 2002 with only six weeks remaining in the third quarter; therefore, Remedy did not contribute a full quarter of financial results to BMC Software in Q3FY03. FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL 2004 GUIDANCE BMC Software expects mid-single digit total revenue growth in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. The company expects fourth quarter earnings per share excluding special items to be in the $0.21 to $0.25 range. Fourth quarter estimates do not include an estimated $0.05 per share of amortization of acquired technology and intangibles, excluding the pending Magic Solutions acquisition. 2
The company expects fiscal 2004 earnings per share excluding special items to be in the $0.53 to $0.57 range, which is higher than the company's previous guidance of $0.48 to $0.53. Fiscal 2004 estimates do not include an estimated $0.22 of amortization of acquired technology and intangibles expense, excluding the pending Magic Solutions acquisition, and $0.43 related to restructuring charges that occurred in the second and third quarter. This guidance assumes that the company's proposed acquisition of the Magic Solutions business closes in the next few weeks and the company records partial quarter results assuming high single digit millions in both revenues and expenses for the fourth quarter with no net impact to earnings. BMC Software is raising its cash flow from operations guidance for fiscal 2004 to be in the $400 million to $450 million range, which is higher than the company's previous cash flow guidance of $340 million to $390 million range. A CONFERENCE CALL TO DISCUSS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS IS SCHEDULED FOR TODAY AT 11:00 A.M. CENTRAL TIME. THOSE INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING MAY CALL (719) 457-2641 AND USE THE PASSCODE BMC. TO ACCESS A REPLAY OF THE CONFERENCE CALL, WHICH WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR ONE WEEK, DIAL (719) 457-0820 AND USE THE PASSCODE BMC.

A REPLAY OF THE WEBCAST WILL BE AVAILABLE WITHIN 24 HOURS AND ARCHIVED ON THE WEBSITE FOR 90 DAYS. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This press release includes financial measures for net earnings, earnings per share (EPS) and operating expenses that exclude certain charges and therefore have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A detailed reconciliation between the GAAP results and results excluding special items (non-GAAP) is included with the financial tables accompanying this press release. BMC Software has provided these non-GAAP measures in its press releases reporting historical financial results because the company believes these measures provide a consistent basis for comparison between quarters, as they are not influenced by certain non-cash or non-recurring expenses and are therefore useful to investors in helping them understand the financial condition of BMC Software by focusing on the performance of its core operations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate the company's performance and as a key variable in determining management compensation. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP, and these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to information provided by other companies.

This news release contains both historical information and forward-looking information. Statements of plans, objectives, strategies and expectations for future operations and results, identified by words such as "believe," "anticipate," "expect" and "guidance" are forward-looking statements. Numerous important factors affect BMC Software's operating results and could cause BMC Software's actual results to differ materially from the results indicated by this press release or by any other forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, BMC Software, and there can be no assurance that future results will meet expectations, estimates or projections. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 1) BMC Software's revenues and earnings are subject to a number of factors, including the significant percentage of quarterly sales typically closed at the end of each quarter, that make estimation of operating results prior to the end of a quarter extremely uncertain; 2) BMC Software's operating costs and expenses are relatively fixed over the short term; 3) increased competition and pricing pressures could adversely affect BMC Software's earnings; 4) growth in BMC Software's mainframe revenues is dependent on demand for significant additional mainframe MIPS capacity; 5) BMC Software's maintenance revenue could decline if maintenance renewal rates decline or if license revenues do not grow; 6) new software products and product strategies may not be timely introduced or successfully adopted; 7) BMC Software's quarterly cash flow from operations is and has been volatile and is dependent upon a number of factors described in BMC Software's filings with the SEC; and 8) the additional risks and important factors described in BMC Software's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in its Annual Report to Stockholders on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003 and other filings with the SEC.
