[NYSE: BMC] today announced financial results for its fiscal 2004 fourth quarter ended March 31, 2004. BMC Software's net earnings excluding special items for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 were $40.8 million, or $0.18 per diluted common share, which compares to $0.17 a year ago and the Company's guidance range of $0.21 to $0.25. These results include an earnings per share reduction of two cents related to one-time items. The fiscal 2004 fourth quarter net earnings on a GAAP basis were $36.9 million, or $0.16 per share, which compares to net earnings of $20.6 million, or $0.09 per share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Included in the financial tables is a reconciliation of results excluding special items and GAAP results. Total revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 were $400.2 million, an increase of 5 percent compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2004. This met the mid-single digit sequential growth that the Company provided in January. Operating expenses, excluding $16.6 million of amortization of acquired intangibles and acquired research and development costs, were $357.2 million, compared to $336.5 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2003. "Our Business Service Management, or BSM, strategy continues to gain momentum as customers and partners alike are embracing its value. BSM is also directly helping the top line as we had strong license bookings growth in our PATROL(R) and Remedy businesses, the areas that benefit most from BSM and which contributed to the Company's strong 35 percent year-over-year growth in license bookings," said Bob Beauchamp, president and CEO, BMC Software. "I am excited about our prospects as we enter fiscal 2005 given our leading enterprise management solutions, a strategy that is working and our continued strong financial position." "Cash flow from operations for fiscal 2004 was $506.5 million, which exceeded our guidance of $400 to $450 million. We strengthened our balance sheet with over $1.2 billion in cash and marketable securities and over $1.4 billion in total deferred revenue at quarter end. Operating expenses were higher than expected due to an $11 million sequential increase in commission expenses, primarily related to a very strong increase in deferred revenues. We also had an equity write-down of $4 million that impacted other income," said George Harrington, senior vice president and CFO, BMC Software. "Entering fiscal 2005, our focus is to ensure that we maximize shareholder value by growing the business, expanding operating margins, and continuing to generate significant cash flows from operations." BMC Software maintained its strong financial position with cash flow from operations in the quarter of $274.1 million. Cash and marketable securities balance was $1.2 billion, an increase of $148.1 million
BMC Software Fourth Quarter Results /Page 2 compared to the third quarter and the total deferred revenue balance was a record $1.40 billion, an increase of $174.9 million compared to the third quarter. BMC Software continued its stock repurchase program by spending $50.0 million to repurchase 2.6 million shares during the fourth fiscal quarter. Approximately $307 million remains in this program. LICENSE BOOKINGS License bookings were up 35 percent year-over-year. License bookings measure the value of new license contracts signed during the quarter, including both the amount that goes to the income statement and the amount that goes to the deferred license revenue account on the balance sheet. As license bookings measure new contracts that are signed in a given quarter, this metric provides a clear measurement of the Company's current sales performance. License bookings can be calculated by adding license revenues to the net change in the deferred license revenue balance, as illustrated below. FOURTH QUARTER FY04 BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS FIRST QUARTER AND FISCAL 2005 GUIDANCE BMC Software expects first quarter revenues to be in the $345 to $355 million range. The Company expects first quarter earnings per share excluding special items to be in the $0.12 to $0.16 range. First quarter estimates do not include an estimated $0.06 per share of amortization of acquired technology and intangibles. For fiscal 2005 the Company is comfortable with the current analyst consensus estimates for revenues of $1.52 billion and earnings per share excluding special items estimate of 77 cents.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This press release includes financial measures for net earnings, earnings per share (EPS) and operating expenses that exclude certain charges and therefore have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A detailed reconciliation between the GAAP results and results excluding special items (non-GAAP) is included with the financial tables accompanying this press release. BMC Software has provided these non-GAAP measures in its press releases reporting historical financial results because the Company believes these measures provide a consistent basis for comparison between quarters, as they are not influenced by certain non-cash or non-recurring expenses and are therefore useful to investors in helping them understand the financial condition of BMC Software by focusing on the performance of its core operations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate the Company's performance and as a key variable in determining management compensation. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP, and these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to information provided by other companies.

BMC Software Fourth Quarter Results /Page 4 Software's revenues and earnings are subject to a number of factors, including the significant percentage of quarterly sales typically closed at the end of each quarter, that make estimation of operating results prior to the end of a quarter extremely uncertain; 2) BMC Software's operating costs and expenses are relatively fixed over the short term; 3) increased competition and pricing pressures could adversely affect BMC Software's earnings; 4) growth in BMC Software's mainframe revenues is dependent on demand for significant additional mainframe MIPS capacity; 5) BMC Software's maintenance revenue could decline if maintenance renewal rates decline or if license revenues do not grow; 6) new software products and product strategies may not be timely introduced or successfully adopted; 7) BMC Software's quarterly cash flow from operations is and has been volatile and is dependent upon a number of factors described in BMC Software's filings with the SEC; and 8) the additional risks and important factors described in BMC Software's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in its Annual Report to Stockholders on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003 and other filings with the SEC.
