[NYSE: BMC] today announced financial results for its fiscal 2005 first quarter ended June 30, 2004. BMC Software's net earnings excluding special items for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 were $32.1 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share, which compares to $0.03 a year ago and the Company's revised guidance range of $0.11 to $0.14 provided earlier this month. The fiscal 2005 first quarter net earnings on a GAAP basis were $51.8 million, or $0.23 per share, which compares to a net loss of $6.1 million, or a loss of $0.03 per share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Included in the financial tables is a reconciliation of results excluding special items and GAAP results. Total revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 were $326.0 million, an increase of 5 percent compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2004, and was within the Company's revised guidance of $318.0 million to $328.0 million provided earlier this month. Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $299.0 million, compared to $321.5 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2004. "The first quarter presented a challenging revenue environment for our industry and for BMC. While disappointed with our revenue performance, which was in part due to weakness in the United States, I was pleased with our expense controls and improved operating margins in the quarter," said Bob Beauchamp, president and CEO, BMC Software. BMC Software maintained its strong financial position with cash flow from operations in the quarter of $90.1 million. The cash and marketable securities balance was $1.2 billion, and the total deferred revenue balance was $1.39 billion. BMC Software continued its stock repurchase program by spending $20.0 million to repurchase approximately 1.2 million shares during the first fiscal quarter. Approximately $287 million remains in this program. License bookings in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 were $83.6 million, a decrease of 20 percent compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2004. The following table illustrates license bookings:

License bookings can be calculated by adding license revenues to the net change in the deferred license revenue balance. SECOND QUARTER AND FISCAL 2005 GUIDANCE The Company expects second quarter revenues to be in the $340 to $355 million range and expects second quarter earnings per share excluding special items to be in the $0.12 to $0.16 range. These expectations include an estimated $10 million in revenues and a negative earnings per share impact of one cent related to the recent acquisition of Marimba. Second quarter estimates do not include an estimated $0.05 per share of amortization of acquired technology and intangibles, exclusive of the Marimba acquisition. The Company expects fiscal 2005 revenues to be in the $1.46 to $1.49 billion range and expects fiscal 2005 earnings per share excluding special items to be in the $0.64 to $0.74 range. These expectations include an estimated $30 million in revenues and a negative earnings per share impact of two cents related to the recent acquisition of Marimba. Fiscal 2005 estimates do not include an estimated $0.20 per share of amortization of acquired technology and intangibles, exclusive of the Marimba acquisition.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This press release includes financial measures for net earnings, earnings per share (EPS) and operating expenses that exclude certain charges and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A detailed reconciliation between the GAAP results and results excluding special items (non-GAAP) is included with the financial tables accompanying this press release. BMC Software has provided these non-GAAP measures in its press releases reporting historical financial results because the Company believes these measures provide a consistent basis for comparison between quarters, as they are not influenced by certain non-cash or non-recurring expenses and are therefore useful to investors in helping them understand the financial condition of BMC Software by focusing on the performance of its core operations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate the Company's performance and as a key variable in determining management compensation. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP, and these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to information provided by other companies.

This news release contains both historical information and forward-looking information. Statements of plans, objectives, strategies and expectations for future operations and results, identified by words such as "believe," "anticipate," "expect," "estimate" and "guidance" are forward-looking statements. Numerous important factors affect BMC Software's operating results and could cause BMC Software's actual results to differ materially from the results indicated by this press release or by any other forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, BMC Software, and there can be no assurance that future results will meet expectations, estimates or projections. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 1) BMC Software's revenues and earnings are subject to a number of factors, including the significant percentage of quarterly sales typically closed at the end of each quarter, that make estimation of operating results prior to the end of a quarter extremely uncertain; 2) BMC Software's operating costs and expenses are relatively fixed over the short term; 3) increased competition and pricing pressures could adversely affect BMC Software's earnings; 4) growth in BMC Software's mainframe revenues is dependent on demand for significant additional mainframe MIPS capacity; 5) BMC Software's maintenance revenue could decline if maintenance renewal rates decline or if license revenues do not grow; 6) new software products and product strategies may not be timely introduced or successfully adopted; 7) BMC Software's quarterly cash flow from operations is and has been volatile and is dependent upon a number of factors described in BMC Software's filings with the SEC; 8) BMC Software's effective tax rate is subject to quarterly fluctuation and any change in such tax rate could affect the Company's earnings; and 9) the additional risks and important factors described in BMC Software's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in its Annual Report to Stockholders on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 and other filings with the SEC.
