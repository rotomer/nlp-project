[NYSE: BMC], a leader in enterprise management, announced that in conjunction with the filing of its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2004, it has adjusted its June quarter GAAP net earnings as compared to the GAAP net earnings presented in the Company's previously issued press release on July 27, 2004 to reflect an update to the Company's accrual for taxes. This adjustment does not affect BMC Software's first quarter net earnings excluding special items of $32.1 million, or $0.14 per share, and does not affect BMC Software's first quarter cash flow from operations of $90.1 million. Subsequent to the Company's earnings press release, the Company completed its analysis of its consolidated tax provisions and associated balance sheet accounts including an assessment of potential tax exposures and the realization of its net deferred tax assets. As a result, the Company's income tax expense for the quarter is $19.6 million as compared to the previously announced benefit of $21.5 million. First quarter net earnings on a GAAP basis were $10.7 million, or $0.05 per share, as compared to the previously announced net earnings on a GAAP basis of $51.8 million, or $0.23 per share. Included in this release is a reconciliation of results excluding special items and GAAP results. Complete condensed consolidated financial statements are included with the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today and is available at www.bmc.com/investors.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This press release includes financial measures for net earnings and earnings per share (EPS) that exclude certain charges and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A detailed reconciliation between the GAAP results and results excluding special items (non-GAAP) is included in this press release. BMC Software has provided these non-GAAP measures in its press releases reporting historical financial results because the Company believes these measures provide a consistent basis for comparison between quarters, as they are not influenced by certain non-cash or non-recurring expenses and are therefore useful to investors in helping them understand the financial condition of BMC Software by focusing on the performance of its core operations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate the Company's performance and as a key variable in determining management compensation. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP, and these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to information provided by other companies. ### BMC Software, the BMC Software logos, and all other BMC Software product or service names are registered trademarks or trademarks of BMC Software, Inc.
