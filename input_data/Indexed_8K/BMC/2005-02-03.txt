[NYSE: BMC] today announced financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2005 ended December 31, 2004. BMC Software's net earnings excluding special items for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 were $49.6 million, or $0.22 per diluted common share, which compares to net earnings of $43.0 million, or $0.19 per diluted common share a year ago. The Company was within its guidance range of $0.18 to $0.23 per diluted common share. Fiscal 2005 third quarter net earnings on a GAAP basis were $36.4 million, or $0.16 per share, which compares to a net loss of $44.4 million, or a loss of $0.20 per share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. Included in the financial tables is a reconciliation of results excluding special items and GAAP results. Total revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 were $386.8 million, an increase of three percent compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2004. The Company was within its guidance range of $380 to $395 million. Operating expenses excluding $18.7 million in special items were $345.6 million, compared to $332.1 million in the same quarter a year ago excluding $104.1 million in special items. Third quarter fiscal 2005 operating expenses excluding special items includes the write-down of some IT assets of approximately $5 million. "I am pleased that we met our revenue and earnings per share goals in the third quarter and delivered strong cash flow from operations of $127.6 million while continuing to maintain our solid balance sheet with over $1.1 billion in cash and marketable securities and a record high $1.49 billion in deferred revenues," said Bob Beauchamp, president and CEO, BMC Software. "Our BSM strategy is helping customers meet their compliance goals as well as reduce costs, automate processes and run more efficient IT organizations to support their businesses. Today, these are decision-drivers for customer purchases." Other income was $27.0 million in the third quarter, which included a gain of $8.0 million related to the termination of the Company's securitization arrangements, which the Company has not utilized for new receivables in the last eight quarters. License bookings in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 were $191.1 million, a 30 percent increase over the second quarter of fiscal 2005 and a 19 percent decrease over the third quarter of
BMC Software Third Quarter Results/Page 2 fiscal 2004. Excluding one very large transaction in the year ago quarter, license bookings were down three percent. The following table illustrates license bookings: THIRD QUARTER FY05 BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS *License bookings measure the value of new license contracts signed during the quarter, including both the amount that goes to the income statement and the amount that goes to the deferred license revenue account on the balance sheet. License bookings can be calculated by adding license revenues and the net change in the deferred license revenue balance. Cash flows from operations were $127.6 million in the third quarter and $227.7 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2005, compared to $74.3 million in the third quarter last year and $232.4 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2004. BMC Software continued its stock repurchase program by spending $25.0 million to repurchase approximately 1.4 million shares during the third fiscal quarter. Approximately $237 million remains in the company's $1 billion share repurchase program. FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL 2005 GUIDANCE The Company expects fourth quarter revenues to be in the $410 to $425 million range and expects fourth quarter earnings per share excluding special items to be in the $0.17 to $0.22 per share range. Fourth quarter estimates do not include an estimated $0.06 per share of amortization of acquired technology and intangibles.
BMC Software Third Quarter Results/Page 3 The Company expects full year fiscal 2005 revenues to be in the $1.478 to $1.493 billion range and expects fiscal 2005 earnings per share excluding special items to be in the $0.69 to $0.74 per share range. Fiscal 2005 estimates do not include an estimated $0.32 per share of special items. BMC Software expects cash flows from operations for fiscal 2005 to be over $400 million, which is unchanged from prior expectations.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This press release includes financial measures for net earnings, earnings per share (EPS) and operating expenses that exclude certain charges and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A detailed reconciliation between the GAAP results and results excluding special items (non-GAAP) is included with the financial tables accompanying this press release. BMC Software has provided these non-GAAP measures in its press releases reporting historical financial results because the Company believes these measures provide a consistent basis for comparison between quarters, as they are not influenced by certain non-cash or non-recurring expenses and are therefore useful to investors in helping them understand the financial condition of BMC Software by focusing on the performance of its core operations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate the Company's performance and as a key variable in determining management compensation. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP, and these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to information provided by other companies.

This news release contains both historical information and forward-looking information. Statements of plans, objectives, strategies and expectations for future operations and results, identified by words such as "believe," "anticipate," "expect," "estimate" and "guidance" are forward-looking statements. Numerous important factors affect BMC Software's operating results and could cause BMC Software's actual results to differ materially from the results indicated by this press release or by any other forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, BMC Software, and there can be no assurance that future results will meet expectations, estimates or projections. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 1) BMC Software's revenues and earnings are subject to a number of factors, including the significant percentage of quarterly sales typically closed at the end of each quarter, that make estimation of operating results prior to the end of a quarter extremely uncertain; 2) BMC Software's operating costs and expenses are relatively fixed over the short term; 3) increased competition and pricing pressures could adversely affect BMC Software's earnings; 4) growth in BMC Software's mainframe revenues is dependent on demand for significant additional mainframe MIPS capacity; 5) BMC Software's maintenance revenue could decline if maintenance renewal rates decline or if license revenues do not grow; 6) new software products and product strategies may not be timely introduced or successfully adopted; 7) BMC Software's quarterly cash flow from operations is and has been volatile and is dependent upon a number of factors described in BMC Software's filings with the SEC; 8) BMC Software's effective tax rate is subject to quarterly fluctuation and any change in such tax rate could affect the Company's earnings; and 9) the additional risks and important factors described in BMC Software's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 and other filings with the SEC.
