The Sellers' Representative shall have the power and authority to make all decisions with regard to the settlement of claims brought pursuant to this Agreement from the Escrow Funds. If the Sellers Representative is unable to carry out his duties as Sellers' Representative, then unless the Sellers' Representative shall have named his successor, the Sellers who held the highest number of Shares immediately prior to the Closing shall be designated and appointed as the Sellers' Representative, as shall assume all of the powers and duties of the Sellers' Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

Exhibit 99.1
     BMC Software, Inc. today announced that it has offered to acquire 100 percent of Identify Software Ltd, a leading global provider of application problem resolution (APR) software. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, BMC will pay approximately $150 million in cash for the shares.
HOUSTON and TEL AVIV  (March 27, 2006) 
     "Transactions are the lifeblood of all businesses," said Bob Beauchamp, BMC president and CEO. "The acquisition of Identify's state-of-the-art application problem resolution technology will further extend BMC's leadership in transaction management and will continue to clearly differentiate BMC's Business Service Management (BSM) strategy. Identify will enable us to offer customers unprecedented problem resolution capabilities that directly impact the way that IT serves the goals of the business. That's the essence of BSM."
     Yochi Slonim, Identify president and CEO, added: "Customers are big winners as a result of this acquisition. BMC is the clear leader in Business Service Management, which is entering the IT mainstream. Identify's application lifecycle management solution, coupled with BMC's existing transaction management solution, will strengthen the company's BSM portfolio and broaden its value proposition into new markets and customers. This will be a very synergistic combination, and Identify is proud to be part of it."
     "The Identify solution reinforces BMC's capability in J2EE and .NET environments and directly supports BMC Business Service Management strategy by providing visibility into the execution of an application that supports a business service," writes JP Garbani in the March 2006 Forrester report . "Identify's application problem resolution

capabilities is a strong complement to BMC's BSM capabilities to look into application performance and map the infrastructure supporting the application delivery."
     An Identify customer, Liquidnet is an electronic institutional trading marketplace that is currently ranked among the ten largest NYSE institutional brokers. "On average, we execute more than 100,000 shares per minute each day. We rely on Identify Software solutions to keep our high-volume, high-value applications running at peak availability," said Kevin Lupowitz, chief information officer at Liquidnet. "Identify's AppSight adds tremendous value by automating and accelerating the problem resolution process, resulting in faster problem fixes, less downtime, and an enhanced customer experience. We view the Identify and BMC Software linkage as positive news."
     
Why Identify
      Problem resolution in the datacenter takes too long and costs too much. The addition of Identify's solutions to BMC's transaction management strategy will provide customers with deep application and problem resolution capabilities, enabling them to pinpoint the cause of transaction breakdowns. Identify's solutions have demonstrated clear and consistent customer ROI and time-to-value savings by increasing application availability and significantly reducing the cost of resolving problems.
Important Customer Value:
      Identify's customers typically are mid-size to large scale organizations in the enterprise and ISV segments that are challenged with the development, maintenance, and support of business-critical applications. Identify has more than 500 customers spanning multiple industries, including market leaders in financial services, technology, insurance, healthcare, public sector, retail, manufacturing, energy and telecommunications.
Expanded Customer Universe:
      Identify extends BMC's delivery of Business Service Management with new application problem resolution capabilities across heterogeneous, distributed applications in J2EE, .NET and native Windows environments. For example, Identify has the first, and only, comprehensive solution for application problem resolution across the application lifecycle, with an architecture uniquely designed from the ground up to optimize the process of resolving problems. Identify's AppSight Problem Resolution System is used by enterprises and independent software and system vendors to automate and dramatically accelerate their problem resolution processes across the
Unequalled Technology Combination:
 
application lifecycle in order to increase application availability and quality, reduce support costs, and accelerate product releases.
     : A successful, high growth company with deep domain expertise and proven year-over-year growth capability, Identify quickly expands BMC's market presence, share and domain expertise in the transaction management market, which is a key area of investment for BMC.
Strong Performance
     The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. BMC expects the transaction to close during the first quarter of FY2007.
