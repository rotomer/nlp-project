BMC Software Announces Fiscal 2007 Second Quarter Results
BMC Software today announced that fiscal 2007 second quarter net earnings on a GAAP basis were $58 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to $43 million, or $0.19 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2006.
HOUSTON, November 8, 2006
Non-GAAP net earnings, which exclude special items, were $78 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to $61 million, or $0.27 per diluted share in the year-ago period. Included in the financial tables is a complete reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results.
"BMC Software delivered a strong fiscal 2007 second quarter," said Bob Beauchamp, the Company's president and chief executive officer. "Total revenues are up significantly. Our Business Service Management strategy is driving strong growth in license bookings, which is one of several leading indicators that BSM is in the mainstream with customers. BMC continues to build shareholder value through revenue growth, improved operating margin, increased cash flow from operations and strong growth in earnings per share. As we move through the second half of our 2007 fiscal year, we remain focused on executing our strategy to further drive value creation, capture the momentum around Business Service Management, optimize the performance of our business units, and further streamline our processes and operations."
In addition, the Company posted the following key results for the second quarter of fiscal 2007:
 
In addition, the Company continued its accelerated stock buy-back program, spending $130 million to re-purchase 5.2 million outstanding shares during the quarter. The Company has $529 million remaining under its current $1 billion share repurchase program, which was approved in the third quarter of fiscal 2006.
"As BMC moves into the second half of fiscal 2007, it's clear that we have significant advantages in the marketplace," said Steve Solcher, the Company's chief financial officer. "Our continued financial strength, coupled with customer acceptance of the benefits of BSM and an ongoing opportunity in the mainframe market, positions BMC well for continued growth. A tighter, more focused and more accountable organization will continue to power greater operating efficiencies. We are moving forward with our share repurchase program while maintaining a strong balance sheet."
With the Company's strong performance in the second quarter, it is raising its non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for the year. BMC now expects non-GAAP EPS will range between $1.40 and $1.48 for fiscal 2007, using an estimated tax rate of 29 percent. Non-GAAP EPS excludes an estimated $0.45 of special items including expenses for amortization of acquired technology and intangibles, stock based compensation and restructuring.
Fiscal 2007 Guidance
The Company also is raising its revenue and non-GAAP operating margin guidance for fiscal 2007. For fiscal 2007, the Company expects revenue growth in the mid-single digits, and it expects non-GAAP operating margin to exceed 20 percent. The Company reiterates its fiscal 2007 cash flow expectation of between $400 million and $450 million, which includes negative impacts from an estimated $45 million related to the timing of servicing receipts as well as an estimated $30 million in restructuring payments.
For the third quarter of fiscal 2007, BMC expects revenues to be in the range of $390 million to $410 million and non-GAAP EPS to be in the $0.35 to $0.39 range, using an estimated tax rate of 29 percent. Non-GAAP EPS excludes an estimated $0.10 of special items including expenses for amortization of acquired technology and intangibles, stock based compensation and restructuring.

This press release and the accompanying tables include the following non-GAAP financial measures: (a) non-GAAP operating expenses, (b) non-GAAP operating income, (c) non-GAAP operating margin, (d) non-GAAP net earnings and (e) non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share. Each of these financial measures excludes the impact of certain items and therefore has not been calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Each of these non-GAAP financial measures excludes restructuring charges, amortization of acquired technology and intangibles, and, for fiscal 2007, stock based compensation expenses. In addition, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2006 exclude income tax expense associated with the one-time repatriation of certain foreign earnings. Each of the adjustments is described in more detail below. This press release also contains a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to its most comparable GAAP financial measure.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results because they exclude amounts that BMC management and the Board of Directors do not consider part of operating results when assessing the performance of the organization and measuring the results of the Company's performance. In addition, we have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports of financial results. BMC Management and the Board of Directors use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company's performance and for forecasting purposes, as well as the allocation of future capital investments, and they are key variables in determining management incentive compensation. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.
 
While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting and may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation between companies. Items such as restructuring charges, amortization of acquired technology and intangibles and stock based compensation expenses that are excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures can have a material impact on net earnings. As a result, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, net earnings, cash flow from operations or other measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures that are included elsewhere in this press release.
The following discusses the reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures:
 
 
This news release contains both historical information and forward-looking information. Statements of plans, objectives, strategies and expectations for future operations and results, identified by words such as "believe," "anticipate," "expect," "estimate" and "guidance" are forward-looking statements. Numerous important factors affect BMC Software's operating results and could cause actual results to differ materially from the forecasts and estimates indicated by this press release or by any other forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, BMC Software, and there can be no assurance that future results will meet expectations, estimates or projections. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 1) the possibility that general economic conditions or uncertainty cause information technology spending to be reduced or purchasing decisions to be delayed; 2) competition in our markets can result in pricing pressures and competition for new customers as well as potential displacements of our existing customers; 3) the adoption rate for BSM may be slower than we expect and customers may not increase their purchases of our products if they do not adopt a BSM strategy; 4) a significant percentage of our license transactions is completed during the final weeks and days of each quarter, which creates a level of uncertainty as to whether revenues, license bookings and/or earnings will have met expectations until after the end of the quarter; 5) our operating costs and expenses are relatively fixed over the short term, so if we have a shortfall in revenue in any given quarter, our ability to off-set revenue shortfalls in the near-term is limited; 6) our effective tax rate is subject to quarterly fluctuation and any change in such tax rate could affect our earnings; and 7) the additional risks and important factors described in BMC Software's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This filing is available on our website at . We undertake no obligation to update information contained in this release.
