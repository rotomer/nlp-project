Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On July 24, 2007, the Compensation Committee, pursuant to delegated authority from the Board of Directors, approved revisions to the business unit targets for purposes of the fiscal 2008 Short-Term Executive Incentive Plan. Such changes were made to update the business unit targets to reflect recent acquisitions completed by the Company and an internal organizational change, all of which occurred after the start of the fiscal year and the establishment of the original business unit targets. As previously disclosed, for fiscal 2008, 70% of an individual executive's annual incentive will be based on whether and the extent to which the Company achieves quarterly and annual non-GAAP earnings per share targets established by the Board. The remaining 30% of an individual executive's annual incentive will be based on whether and the extent to which certain business unit measures, which will vary by executive depending on their primary responsibilities, are achieved.
