Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Merger Agreement
     On March 17, 2008, BMC Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("BMC") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") by and among BMC, Bengal Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of BMC (the "Purchaser"), and BladeLogic, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("BladeLogic"), pursuant to which BMC will acquire BladeLogic, a leading data center automation software company, for $28.00 per share, or approximately $800 million, net of cash acquired.
     The acquisition will be conducted by means of a cash tender offer (the "Offer") for all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of BladeLogic (the "Shares"), which BMC expects to commence promptly. Under the Merger Agreement, after completion of the Offer and the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to the merger including, if required, a vote of BladeLogic's stockholders, the Purchaser will be merged with and into BladeLogic, with BladeLogic surviving the merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of BMC. Holders of Shares not purchased in the Offer (other than Shares owned by the Company, BMC or the Purchaser, and shares owned by stockholders who have perfected their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such Shares under Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law) will be entitled to receive $28.00 per Share in cash in the merger.
     The Merger Agreement includes other customary closing conditions, including among others, the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. In addition, BMC's acceptance of the tendered Shares is conditioned on there being validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn before the expiration of the Offer, a number of Shares, which, when added to any Shares already owned by BMC or any of its controlled subsidiaries, represents at least a majority of the Shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis (which means the total number of outstanding Shares plus the total number of Shares that are issuable upon the conversion or exercise of BladeLogic stock options or other derivative securities regardless of the conversion or exercise price, vesting schedule or other terms or conditions). Certain directors, officers and stockholders of BladeLogic have agreed to tender their Shares in connection with the tender offer, including any Shares acquired upon exercise of stock options prior to the closing of the acquisition. Those directors, officers and stockholders of BladeLogic currently hold Shares representing approximately 38.3% of BladeLogic's outstanding Shares, which percentage may increase prior to the consummation of the Offer depending upon the number of Shares, if any, acquired by those persons upon exercise of stock options as well as other factors.
     The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Cautionary Note Regarding Merger Agreement
     The Merger Agreement has been attached to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about BladeLogic, BMC or Purchaser. In particular, the assertions embodied in the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement are qualified by information in confidential disclosure schedules provided by BladeLogic as well as BMC and the Purchaser in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement. These disclosure schedules contain information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, certain representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement were used for the purpose of allocating risk between BladeLogic, BMC and Purchaser, rather than establishing matters of fact. Accordingly, the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement may not constitute the actual state of facts about BladeLogic, BMC or Purchaser.
Cautionary Statements
     This filing and the exhibits attached hereto contain forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If such risks or uncertainties materialize or such assumptions prove incorrect, the results of BMC and its consolidated subsidiaries could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements and assumptions. All statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including the expected benefits and costs of the transaction;
 
management plans relating to the transaction; the expected timing of the completion of the transaction; the ability to complete the transaction considering the various closing conditions, including those conditions related to regulatory approvals; any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations, including the execution of integration plans; any statements of expectation or belief; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Risks, uncertainties and assumptions include the possibility that expected benefits may not materialize as expected; that the transaction may not be timely completed, if at all; that, prior to the completion of the transaction, BladeLogic's business may not perform as expected due to transaction-related uncertainty or other factors; that the parties are unable to successfully implement integration strategies; and other risks that are described from time to time in BMC's and BladeLogic's Securities and Exchange Commission reports, including but not limited to the risks described in BMC's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2007 and BladeLogic's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2007. BMC assumes no obligation and does not intend to update these forward-looking statements.

BMC SOFTWARE TO PURCHASE BLADELOGIC
Transforms BMC into the Service Automation leader
 BMC Software (NYSE: BMC) has signed a definitive agreement to purchase BladeLogic (NSDQ: BLOG), the leading and fastest growing data center automation company, for $28.00 in cash per outstanding share of BladeLogic common stock or approximately $800 million, net of cash acquired.
HOUSTON, March 17, 2008
When completed, the BladeLogic acquisition will add a significant, high-growth revenue stream to BMC, accelerating the company's long-term growth expectations for revenues, earnings, and cash flow.
"Organizations around the world will spend more than $140 billion dollars this year running data centers," said Bob Beauchamp, BMC's president and chief executive officer. "Automation is the only way IT can bring this spending under control and still meet the reliability and time-to-market requirements of their businesses. BMC's acquisition of BladeLogic will create the new IT Service Automation leader, unique in its ability to provide these critical capabilities. It is a natural and very significant next step in our vision of Business Service Management."
BMC was the first enterprise software company to articulate the customer need for Business Service Management (BSM), the most effective approach for managing IT from the perspective of the
 
business. This acquisition will combine BMC's BSM platform with BladeLogic's award-winning data center automation solutions. BladeLogic is the fastest growing company in the fastest growing segment of IT management software.
Customers of the combined solution can expect a 90 percent improvement in IT operational efficiency in 90 days, as well as address the critical challenges of compliance, virtualization, and availability. In contrast, competitors' incomplete and disjointed portfolios typically lead to partial solutions that demand expensive and lengthy professional services engagements.
"When it comes to data center management, IT organizations have learned the hard way that the architecture you start with is the architecture you're stuck with," said Dev Ittycheria, BladeLogic's president and chief executive officer. "From day one, we focused on developing an architecture specifically designed for managing today's complex data center. Our growth and competitive win rate is strong evidence that we got this right. Our award-winning, next-generation architecture will be a natural extension of BMC's BSM platform."
A highly integrated architecture is required to realize the potential of Service Automation. BMC and BladeLogic's solution portfolios are already integrated, and customers have embraced the combined solution. This is a continuation of BMC's strategy to preserve the "purpose built" capabilities of each company's products, as demonstrated by BMC's other recent successful acquisitions.
 
"BMC has a history of smart, successful acquisitions because we focus on customer needs, cultural compatibility and tight product integration," said Jim Grant, senior vice president and general manager of BMC's Enterprise Service Management business unit. "BMC is the only independent software vendor able to meet the customer demand for comprehensively architected and automated IT management solutions. For us, this is a great opportunity to capitalize on the customer dissatisfaction with our competitors' offerings created by continued product shortcomings and forced migrations."
Over the last twelve months, BMC has acquired and successfully integrated multiple companies whose performance continues to exceed expectations.
David Williams, research vice president, Gartner, recently reinforced the importance of IT automation stating, "Automating the IT management process continues to be a key objective for IT executives focused on driving cost and complexity out of IT operations."
BMC expects this transaction to significantly accelerate the company's top-line growth. From an EPS perspective, BMC expects it to be slightly dilutive to non-GAAP earnings in fiscal year 2009, including the write-down of deferred revenues and one-time integration and retention expenses. The company expects it to be accretive to non- GAAP earnings in fiscal year 2010. The acquisition will be conducted by means of a tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of common
 
stock of BladeLogic, followed by a second-step merger. The board of directors of BladeLogic has unanimously recommended that the stockholders of BladeLogic accept the offer. The offer, which is expected to commence within the next ten days, will be subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approvals.
