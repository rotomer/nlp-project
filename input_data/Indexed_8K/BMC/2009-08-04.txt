Exhibit 99
BMC Software Announces Fiscal 2010 First Quarter Results
Total revenue grew 3 percent, and by 6 percent on a constant currency basis
Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 7 percent
Non-GAAP operating margin increased by 8 percentage points to 33 percent
Non-GAAP diluted EPS was 59 cents, up 37 percent
Cash flow from operations was $155 million, an increase of 3 percent
Company increases non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance range for fiscal 2010 by 10 cents and reiterates expectations for other key metrics
HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--August 4, 2009--BMC Software (NYSE:BMC) today announced its fiscal 2010 first quarter results.
Fiscal 2010 first quarter revenue was $450 million, an increase of 3 percent from the year-ago period. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew 6 percent. License revenue in the first quarter was $167 million, an increase of 12 percent compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2009.
The Companys GAAP net earnings for the quarter were $82 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, versus $1 million and $0.01 per diluted share in the year-ago period. First quarter GAAP net earnings for fiscal 2009 were impacted by a $50 million in-process research and development write-down recorded in connection with the acquisition of BladeLogic in the prior year quarter.
The Companys non-GAAP net earnings for the fiscal first quarter, excluding special items, were $111 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, compared to $82 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Included in the financial tables is a complete reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP results.
In a difficult operating environment, BMC performed relatively well during the first quarter of fiscal 2010, said Bob Beauchamp, BMCs chairman and chief executive officer. We achieved solid results across most of our key financial metrics, we remain on track to attain our goals for the year, and we are in fact raising our fiscal 2010 EPS guidance. The weaker economic environment, a longer sales cycle and the lumpy nature of our MSM business affected first quarter bookings. Our markets, customer base, strategy, partnerships, competitive position, financial position and technology remain strong.
The Company posted the following key results for the fiscal 2010 first quarter:
Total bookings in the first quarter were $390 million, down 19 percent as reported and 15 percent on a constant currency basis.
ESM license bookings were $73 million in the first quarter, down 25 percent from $96 million in the year-ago period. On a constant currency basis, ESM license bookings were down 19 percent.
ESM non-GAAP operating income increased to $43 million from $17 million. ESM non-GAAP operating margin increased by 9 percentage points to 16 percent.
MSM non-GAAP operating income increased by 12 percent from $94 million to $105 million. MSM non-GAAP operating margin increased by 3 percentage points to 56 percent.
The Companys balance sheet remains strong, with $1.3 billion in cash and investments and $1.7 billion in deferred revenue.
During the first fiscal quarter, BMC continued its stock repurchase activities, spending $50 million to repurchase 1.4 million shares. As of June 30, 2009, the Company has approximately $295 million remaining under its existing share repurchase program. The Company plans to increase its share repurchase activity in the second quarter.
Steve Solcher, BMCs chief financial officer, said: Our first quarter results reflect the strength of our business model and the operating discipline we have instilled in our business. During the quarter we grew revenue, reduced expenses, significantly improved profitability and generated solid cash flow from operations. While we expect to meet or exceed our key metrics for fiscal 2010, we will continue to closely monitor underlying market conditions and their impact on our business as we remain focused on achieving our profitability and cash flow goals.
Fiscal 2010 Expectations
For fiscal 2010, the Company is increasing its full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance and reiterating guidance for all other key metrics. The Company expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $2.47 to $2.57 per share, which at the midpoint would represent a 12 percent increase year over year. This range assumes a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 29 percent and excludes an estimated 58 cents to 62 cents of special items, including expenses related to the amortization of acquired technology and intangibles, stock-based compensation and restructuring activity.
The assumptions underlying this full year fiscal 2010 estimate include:
Total bookings and revenue growth in the low single digits on a reported basis. The Company expects the constant currency growth rates to be 100 basis points higher for revenue and for currency to have no impact on its full-year bookings;
A license bookings ratable rate in the low 50s versus 50 percent in fiscal 2009 as the Company expects to return to a more normal volume of large transactions with complex terms and conditions; and
A continued improvement in non-GAAP operating margin.
The Company also expects cash flow from operations to be between $600 million to $650 million.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Companys results as determined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company has also disclosed in this press release and the accompanying tables the following non-GAAP information: (a) non-GAAP operating expenses, (b) non-GAAP operating income, (c) non-GAAP operating margin, (d) non-GAAP net earnings and (e) non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share. Each of these financial measures excludes the impact of certain items and therefore has not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the amortization of intangible assets, charges related to in-process research and development, share-based compensation expenses and restructuring charges, as well as the related tax impacts on these items. Each of the adjustments is described in more detail below. This press release also contains a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to its most comparable GAAP financial measure.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results because they exclude amounts that BMC management and the Board of Directors do not consider part of operating results when assessing the performance of the organization and measuring the results of the Companys performance. In addition, we have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports of financial results. BMC Management and the Board of Directors use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Companys performance and for forecasting purposes, as well as the allocation of future capital investments, and they are key variables in determining management incentive compensation. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.
While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting and may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation between companies. Items such as the amortization of intangible assets, charges related to in-process research and development, share-based compensation expenses and restructuring charges that are excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures can have a material impact on net earnings. As a result, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, net earnings, cash flow from operations or other measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures that are included elsewhere in this press release.
The following discusses the reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures:
 . Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude costs associated with the amortization of intangible assets. Management and the Board of Directors believe it is useful in evaluating the Companys and its management teams and business units performance during a particular time period to review the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude amortization of intangible assets, because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. Accordingly, management and the Board of Directors do not consider these costs for purposes of evaluating the performance of the business during the applicable time period after the acquisition, and they exclude such costs when evaluating the performance of the Company, its business units and its management teams and when making decisions to allocate resources among the Companys business units.
Amortization of intangible assets
 Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude in-process research and development charges recorded in prior year periods. These amounts represent the estimated fair value of core research and development projects that were incomplete as of the respective dates of acquisition and had neither reached technological feasibility nor been determined to have alternative future uses pending achievement of technological feasibility upon further development. Such amounts were required to be expensed by us as of the date of the respective acquisition. Because the costs are fixed at the time of acquisition and are not subject to management influence, management does not consider the costs in evaluating the performance of the Company and its business units nor when it allocates resources among the business units. We believe excluding these items is useful to investors because it facilitates comparisons to our historical operating results without being affected by our acquisition history and the results of other companies in our industry, which have their own unique acquisition histories.
In-process research and development charges.
 Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the compensation expenses required to be recorded by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No 123 (Revised 2004), Share-based Payment (SFAS 123(R)) for equity awards to employees and directors. Management and the Board of Directors believe it is useful in evaluating the Companys and its management teams and business units performance during a particular time period to review the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude expenses related to share-based compensation, because these costs are generally fixed at the time an award is granted, are then expensed over several years and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management once granted. Accordingly, our operational managers are evaluated based on the operating expenses exclusive of share-based compensation expenses and including such charges would hamper investors ability to evaluate the performance of our management in the manner in which the Companys management evaluates performance. Additionally, we believe it is useful in measuring the Companys performance to exclude expenses related to FAS 123(R) equity expense because it enables comparability with prior period information. Accordingly, management and the Board of Directors do not consider these costs for purposes of evaluating the performance of the business, and they exclude such costs when evaluating the performance of the Company, its business units and its management teams and when making decisions to allocate resources among the Companys business units.
Share-based compensation expenses.
 Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude exit costs and related charges, primarily consisting of severance costs and lease abandonment costs, and any subsequent changes in estimates related to exit activities as they relate to our restructurings, which involved significant layoffs. Management and the Board of Directors believe it is useful in evaluating the Companys and its management teams and business units performance during a particular time period to review the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude restructuring costs, because our operational managers are evaluated based on the operating expenses exclusive of restructuring charges and including the restructuring charges would hinder investors ability to evaluate the performance of our management in the manner in which the Companys management evaluates performance. Accordingly, management and the Board of Directors do not consider these costs for purposes of evaluating the performance of the business, and they exclude such costs when evaluating the performance of the Company, its business units and its management teams. Additionally, management uses the non-GAAP measures to assist in its determinations regarding the allocation of resources, such as capital investment, among the Companys business units and as part of its forecasting and budgeting.
Restructuring charges.
In this press release we refer to certain bookings information. Bookings represent the transactional value of new contracts executed by us and reflected in our financial statements, including amounts recorded to both revenue and deferred revenue. We also refer to growth rates for revenue and bookings at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that the business results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the Companys business performance. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.

This news release and other related public statements we make contain both historical information and forward-looking information. Statements of plans, objectives, strategies and expectations for future operations and results, identified by words such as believe, anticipate, expect, estimate and guidance are forward-looking statements. Numerous important factors affect BMC Software's operating results and could cause BMC Software's actual results to differ materially from the forecasts and estimates indicated by this press release or by any other forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, BMC Software, and there can be no assurance that future results will meet expectations, estimates or projections. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 1) the possibility that general economic conditions or uncertainty cause information technology spending to be reduced or purchasing decisions to be delayed; 2) competition in our markets can result in pricing pressures and competition for new customers as well as potential displacements of our existing customers; 3) our cash flow from operations could be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, lengthening sales cycles, the size and timing of bookings, customer payment terms, the timing of collections, increased expenses, reduced net earnings and movement in foreign currency exchange rates; 4) a significant percentage of our license transactions are completed during the final weeks and days of each quarter, which creates a level of uncertainty as to whether revenue, license bookings and/or earnings will have met expectations until after the end of the quarter; 5) our operating costs and expenses are relatively fixed over the short term, so if we have a shortfall in revenue in any given quarter, our ability to offset revenue shortfalls in the near-term is limited; 6) changes to our sales organization, including personnel and process changes, may have unintended negative consequences; 7) our expectations for revenue and earnings are based on an assumption of the percentage of license revenue which will be recognized upfront versus deferred; if our actual results do not match our assumption, our recognized revenue and resultant earnings could fall short of expectations; 8) our effective tax rate is subject to quarterly fluctuation and any change in such tax rate could affect our earnings; and 9) the additional risks and important factors described in BMC Software's Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
