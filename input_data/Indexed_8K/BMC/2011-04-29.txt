Item 5.02.    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
On April 27, 2011, the Compensation Committee and Board of Directors, in connection with the annual review of executive compensation, established and determined the following executive compensation matters related to the Company's named executive officers:
1. Mr. Robert E. Beauchamp's annual base salary was increased from $950,000 to $980,000 and his annual target bonus, as a percentage of base salary, was increased from 150% to 160%. Mr. Stephen B. Solcher's annual base salary was increased from $475,000 to $550,000; Mr. William D. Miller's annual base salary was increased from $450,000 to $490,000; and Ms. Hollie S. Castro's annual base salary was increased from $400,000 to $430,000.
2. The performance measures were established for fiscal 2012 for the Company's Short-Term Incentive Compensation Plan. Except for Mr. Beauchamp as noted above, the target annual incentives as a percentage of base salary for the named executive officers are unchanged from those disclosed in the Company's proxy statement dated June 17, 2010. For fiscal 2012, for Messrs. Beauchamp and Solcher and Ms. Castro, 60% of their annual incentive will be based on whether and the extent to which the Company achieves quarterly total bookings targets and 40% will be based on whether and the extent to which the Company achieves quarterly non-GAAP operating margin targets. For Mr. Miller, 20% of his annual incentive will be based on whether and the extent to which the Company achieves quarterly total bookings targets, 40% will be based on whether and the extent to which our mainframe service management ("MSM") business unit achieves quarterly bookings targets and 40% will be based on whether and the extent to which our MSM business unit achieves quarterly non-GAAP operating margin targets. The actual bonus payments under such awards may be less than or greater than the target amounts depending on whether and the extent to which the goals upon which such bonuses are based are achieved.
