BMC delivers record fiscal year results for revenue, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP diluted EPS and cash flow from operations
Revenue for fiscal 2012 rose 5 percent
Total cloud bookings for fiscal 2012 were approximately $100 million, with cloud-related license bookings rising 70 percent in fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011
SaaS bookings grew by nearly 250 percent with over 200 customers added during fiscal 2012
MSM fiscal 2012 bookings rose 6 percent year-over-year
Professional Services revenue rose 21 percent in fiscal 2012
Non-GAAP operating income for the year increased by 6 percent
Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the year was up 9 percent
Cash flow from operations for the year grew 5 percent to $800 million
HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 9, 2012--BMC Software (NASDAQ: BMC), the recognized leader in Business Service Management (BSM), today announced its fiscal 2012 fourth quarter and full year results.
GAAP net earnings for the full fiscal year were $401 million, or $2.32 per diluted share, versus $456 million, or $2.50 per diluted share in fiscal 2011. Non-GAAP net earnings for the year were $562 million, or $3.25 per diluted share, compared to $546 million, or $2.99 per diluted share in fiscal 2011.
GAAP net earnings in both fiscal 2012 and 2011 were positively impacted by net income tax benefits of $6 million and $57 million, respectively, associated with tax authority settlements related to prior years tax matters. These tax benefits were excluded from the Companys non-GAAP results.
GAAP net earnings for the fourth quarter were $71 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, versus $123 million, or $0.67 per diluted share in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP net earnings for the quarter were $123 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, which reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter of 30 percent.
Included in the financial tables is a complete reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP results.
BMC ended fiscal 2012 with encouraging momentum. With increased sales capacity, powerful additions to our technology portfolio and expanded global alliances, we are more strongly positioned than ever to capture the growing demand among enterprises for a comprehensive, heterogeneous and seamlessly integrated IT management platform, said Bob Beauchamp, BMCs chairman and chief executive officer. Our cloud and SaaS initiatives continue to generate strong growth, our MSM business remains a solid performer and our Global Services business is gaining size and scale.
The Company posted the following key results for fiscal 2012 and the fourth fiscal quarter:
ESM license bookings during the fourth quarter rose 21 percent on a sequential basis.
In the fourth quarter, BMCs SaaS bookings nearly tripled and our cloud-related license bookings nearly doubled on a year-over-year basis.
The Companys overall ESM sales force capacity rose 20 percent for the year, excluding Numara.
MSM total bookings overall rose 6 percent for the full fiscal year with nearly 550 new product placements to new and existing customers.
Services revenue grew 10 percent for the fourth quarter and 21 percent for the full fiscal year.
During the fourth quarter, BMC continued its stock repurchase activities, spending $150 million to repurchase 4.1 million shares. For fiscal 2012, BMC repurchased 19.2 million shares at a cost of $781 million. The Company had $850 million remaining in its current share repurchase program as of March 31, 2012.
The improvement and momentum we demonstrated in the fourth quarter bodes well as we enter fiscal 2013, said Steve Solcher, BMCs chief financial officer. Despite the challenges we faced throughout the fiscal year, for the year we grew non-GAAP operating income by 6 percent, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by 9 percent and cash flow from operations by 5 percent.
Fiscal 2013 Expectations
For fiscal 2013, BMC expects non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.49 to $3.59 per share. At the midpoint, this would represent a 9 percent increase over fiscal 2012.
This range excludes an estimated $1.07 to $1.12 per share for non-GAAP adjustments, including expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, and severance, exit costs and related charges.
The assumptions underlying the full year fiscal 2013 expectations include:
Total bookings growth in the mid to high single digits
ESM license bookings growth in the low double digits
MSM total bookings flat compared to the previous year with annualized bookings growth in the low double digits
Revenue growth in the mid to high single digits with a license bookings ratable rate slightly lower than the prior year
Non-GAAP operating margin slightly lower than the prior year
Currency impact at todays rates
Other income at a loss of around $30 million, which incorporates the recent $500 million debt issuance
Weighted shares outstanding down approximately 5 percent from the prior year
A non-GAAP tax rate of 26.5 percent  flat compared to fiscal 2012
BMC expects full year fiscal 2013 cash flow from operations to be between $800 million and $850 million, which at the midpoint represents a 3 percent improvement over fiscal 2012.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Companys results as determined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company has also disclosed in this press release and the accompanying tables the following non-GAAP information: (a) non-GAAP operating expenses, (b) non-GAAP operating income, (c) non-GAAP operating margin, (d) non-GAAP net earnings and (e) non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. Each of these financial measures excludes the impact of certain items and therefore has not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude share-based compensation expense; the amortization of intangible assets; severance, exit costs and related charges; as well as the related tax impacts of these items; and certain discrete tax items. Each of the non-GAAP adjustments is described in more detail below. This press release also contains a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to its most comparable GAAP financial measure.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results because they exclude amounts that BMC management and the board of directors do not consider part of core operating results when assessing the performance of the organization. In addition, we have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures and we believe that inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports of financial results. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency of supplemental information used by management.
While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting and may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation between companies. Items such as share-based compensation expense; the amortization of intangible assets; severance, exit costs and related charges; as well as the related tax impacts of these items; and certain discrete tax items that are excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures can have a material impact on net earnings. As a result, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, net earnings, cash flow from operations or other measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures that are included elsewhere in this press release.
The following discusses the reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures:
Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the compensation expenses required to be recorded by GAAP for equity awards to employees and directors. Management and the board of directors believe it is useful in evaluating corporate performance during a particular time period to review the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, excluding expenses related to share-based compensation, because these costs are generally fixed at the time an award is granted, are then expensed over several years and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management once granted.
Share-based compensation expense.
. Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude costs associated with the amortization of intangible assets. Management and the board of directors believe it is useful in evaluating corporate performance during a particular time period to review the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, excluding amortization of intangible assets, because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.
Amortization of intangible assets
Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude severance, exit costs and related charges, and any subsequent changes in estimates, as they relate to our corporate restructuring and exit activities. Management and the board of directors believe it is useful in evaluating corporate performance during a particular time period to review the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, excluding severance, exit costs and related charges, in order to provide comparability and consistency with historical operating results.
Severance, exit costs and related charges.
Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude net tax benefits of $6 million and $57 million for the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, in connection with tax authority settlements related to prior years tax matters. Management excludes the impact of these items in evaluating corporate performance. Therefore, we exclude these items when presenting non-GAAP financial measures.
Certain discrete tax items.
In this press release we refer to certain bookings information. Bookings represent the transactional value of new contracts closed and recorded in our financial statements, including amounts recorded to both revenue and deferred revenue. We also refer to growth rates for revenue and bookings at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that the business results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the Companys business performance. Generally, when the U.S. dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.

This news release and other related public statements we make contain both historical information and forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as believes, anticipates, intends, expects, estimates, guidance, outlook, view and similar references to future periods. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make regarding our expectations and guidance for fiscal 2013 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and cash flow from operations, including the underlying assumptions, as well as statements we make regarding our plans, objectives, strategies and expectations for future operations and results. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: 1) the possibility that general economic conditions or uncertainty cause information technology spending to be reduced or purchasing decisions to be delayed; 2) competition in our markets and market entrants utilizing alternative business models can result in pricing pressures and competition for new customers as well as potential displacements of our existing customers; 3) our cash flow from operations could be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, lengthening sales cycles, the size and timing of bookings, customer payment terms, the timing of collections, increased expenses, reduced net earnings and movement in foreign currency exchange rates; 4) a significant percentage of our license transactions are completed during the final weeks and days of each quarter, which creates a level of uncertainty as to whether revenue, license bookings and/or earnings will have met expectations until after the end of the quarter; 5) our operating costs and expenses are relatively fixed over the short term, so if we have a shortfall in revenue in any given quarter, our ability to offset revenue shortfalls in the near-term is limited; 6) software product development is highly technical and inherently complex and delays in the timing and feasibility of product releases could have a material adverse effect on expectations and actual results for bookings, revenue, margins and cash flow from operations; 7) changes to our sales organization, including personnel, compensation practices and organizational and process changes, may be disruptive and negatively impact our results of operations; 8) our expectations for revenue and earnings are based on assumptions of the percentage of license revenue which will be recognized upfront versus deferred and the percentage of customer renewals for maintenance contracts; if our actual results do not match our assumptions, our recognized revenue and resultant earnings could fall short of expectations; 9) our effective tax rate is subject to quarterly fluctuation and any change in such tax rate could affect our earnings; 10) we conduct significant transactions in currencies other than the United States dollar and changes in the value of major foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar can significantly affect our reported revenue and operating results; 11) customers may not require, or may delay, additional capacity upgrades of our software, particularly our mainframe management software, due to the existence of sufficient hardware capacity, the uncertain timing of hardware upgrades or other reasons, and the timing of renewals of existing license agreements may be different than we expect; and 12) the additional risks and important factors described in BMC Software's Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These filings are available on our website at . Any forward-looking statement made by us in this news release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.
