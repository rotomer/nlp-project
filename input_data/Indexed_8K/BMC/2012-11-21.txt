On November 21, 2012, BMC Software, Inc. ("BMC") entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent and Lender, and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Book Manager, providing for an unsecured term loan facility (the "Term Loan Facility") in an aggregate principal amount of $200 million (the "Term Loan"). The Credit Agreement provides that proceeds of the borrowing under the Term Loan Facility will be used for general corporate purposes.
The Term Loan will bear interest, at BMC's option, at a rate equal to either (i) the LIBOR rate plus a margin based on BMC's senior unsecured long-term debt rating, for interest periods of 1, 2, 3 or 6 months or (ii) the base rate plus a margin based on BMC's senior unsecured long-term debt rating. The base rate is defined as the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus a margin equal to 0.50%, (ii) Bank of America, N.A.'s prime rate, and (iii) except during a period when LIBOR rates are unavailable, the LIBOR rate for a 1-month interest period plus a margin equal to 1.00%. Accrued interest on the Term Loan is payable at the end of each interest rate period (or at each three-month interval in the case of loans with interest periods greater than three months) with respect to LIBOR rate loans and quarterly in arrears with respect to base rate loans. Under certain circumstances, a default interest rate will apply on all obligations not paid when due at a per annum rate equal to 2.0% above the base rate plus the then applicable margin for base rate loans.
On the closing date, BMC was obligated to pay certain customary closing fees for a credit facility of this size and type.
BMC may not prepay the Term Loan prior to the second anniversary of the closing date. BMC may voluntarily prepay the Term Loan after the second anniversary of the closing date subject to a prepayment premium of 0.50% of the aggregate principal amount prepaid. The Credit Agreement terminates on November 21, 2015 and the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Term Loan at such time will be due and payable on such date.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties. The Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict BMC's ability to, among other things, grant liens, incur subsidiary indebtedness, merge or consolidate, enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions, and make certain payments, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type. BMC is also required to maintain compliance with a consolidated interest coverage ratio and a consolidated leverage ratio.
The Credit Agreement includes customary events of default that include, among other things, non-payment defaults, covenant defaults, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, cross default to material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults, material judgment defaults, ERISA defaults and a change of control default. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the Credit Agreement.
The above description of the material terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto.

General
 
(b) (i) . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by ) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

(ii) . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent

Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.

Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurodollar Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans having the requested Interest Period or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.
