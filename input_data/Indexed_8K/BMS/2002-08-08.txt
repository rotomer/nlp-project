ITEM 5 - OTHER EVENTS
 
Special, one-time, SEC mandated CEO and CFO certification. 
 
                On June 27, 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued an order that requires the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of companies that had revenues in excess of $1.2 billion in their last fiscal year to submit, in hard-copy form with the SEC Secretary, a one-time certification that reports filed by the company are both complete and accurate.  The purpose of the order is to provide greater assurance to the SEC and investors that these companies have complied with the rules and regulations governing financial reporting and accounting practices in reports filed with the SEC this year.
 
                The SEC further recommended on July 29, 2002, that although they intended to make these statements publicly available as quickly as possible, companies should file the statements on Form 8-K and take any other actions necessary to ensure broad dissemination of the statements.
 
                As recommended by the SEC, the mandated certifications are included with this Form 8-K filing as Exhibit 99.1 and 99.2.  These certifications will be posted to the Company's website at www.bemis.com.
