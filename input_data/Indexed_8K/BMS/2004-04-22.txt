FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
BEMIS COMPANY REPORTS 21 PERCENT INCREASE IN 1 QUARTER EPS AND RECORD SALES OF $684 MILLION;  2004 EPS AND CAPEX GUIDANCE INCREASES
ST
 
MINNEAPOLIS, April 22, 2004  - Bemis Company, Inc. (NYSE-BMS) today reported quarterly diluted earnings of $0.40 per share for the first quarter ended March 31, 2004, a 21.2 percent increase compared to the prior year's earnings of $0.33 per share.
 
First quarter net sales increased 7.1 percent to a record $684 million from $639 million in the prior year.  Currency effects accounted for 3.2 percent of the increase.  The impact of acquisitions was not significant.
 
"Bemis delivered solid performance this quarter," said Jeff Curler, Bemis Company President and Chief Executive Officer. "We are capturing the benefits of our 2003 restructuring activities, successfully implementing our proven business strategy, and making strategic investments to grow the business.  I am confident that the combination of these efforts will help us achieve our goals in 2004 and position us well for growth in the future."
 
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Flexible Packaging
Flexible packaging, representing about 79 percent of total company net sales, reported net sales of $539 million in the first quarter, an increase of 4.7 percent compared to the same quarter in 2003.  Currency effects accounted for about 2.4 percent of sales growth.  Operating profit for the first quarter was $73.6 million, up 10.9 percent from the first quarter of 2003.  As a percentage of net sales, operating profit increased to 13.7 percent from 12.9 percent a year ago.
 
"Packaging markets continue to grow toward our strengths in material technology," said Curler. "Sales in the first quarter benefited from year-over-year increases in unit volume of value-added packaging for meat, cheese, confectionery, snack food and medical device markets.  Some of this increase was offset by lower unit sales volume to markets for bakery, pet food and industrial products.  Operating profit improvement is being driven by prudent cost management and improved sales mix.  Our product teams are working closely with customers in all markets to deliver packaging innovation, and we are making capital investments where appropriate to support our customers' growing needs."
 
Pressure Sensitive Materials
First quarter net sales from the pressure sensitive materials business segment were $145 million, a 17.0 percent increase from the first quarter of 2003.  Currency effects accounted for about 6.5 percent of this increase while a November 2003 graphics products acquisition accounted for about 3.5 percent.  Operating profit of $5.6 million or 3.9 percent of net sales for the quarter improved from the first quarter of 2003 when operating profit was $2.5 million or 2.0 percent of net sales.
Commenting on the results of the pressure sensitive materials business segment, Curler said, "We are executing a strategy that will position Bemis in niche markets where we can differentiate our products and develop strong customer relationships.  With the closure of our Las Vegas, Nevada plant in March, we expect to achieve improved performance in future quarters as we continue to control costs and improve efficiencies."
 
Capital Structure
Total debt was $581 million, compared to the year-end 2003 balance of $590 million.  Debt to total capitalization was 30.3 percent at March 31, 2004, compared to 31.4 percent at December 31, 2003.
 
Other Costs (Income), Net
Other costs and income includes restructuring and related charges of $0.9 million offset by a $1.4 million gain on the sale of a previously closed plant in Union City, California.  It also includes a $2.6 million increase in equity income from the Company's Brazilian joint venture.  This increase reflects improved profitability of the joint venture operations and an increase in equity ownership from 33 percent to 45 percent.
 
2004 Earnings Outlook
Bemis expects second quarter 2004 earnings per share to be up modestly compared to the strong first quarter level.  For the full year 2004, management is revising guidance upward and now expects to deliver diluted earnings in the range of $1.62 to $1.70 per share.  Previously announced guidance was $1.58 to $1.65 per share.
 
Bemis also expects to make additional capital investments in 2004 to support growing demand for particular products.  Capital expenditures for 2004 are expected to be in the range of $140 million to $145 million, a $10 million increase from previously announced guidance.
