FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
BEMIS COMPANY REPORTS RECORD THIRD QUARTER SALES AND EARNINGS
 
Bemis Company, Inc. (NYSE-BMS) today reported record third quarter diluted earnings of $0.41 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2004, in line with management's previously disclosed guidance.  This represents an increase of 28.1 percent compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.32 for the third quarter of 2003.  Restructuring and related charges totaled $1.1 million and $10.8 million during the third quarters of 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Excluding the impact of these charges, third quarter earnings per share for 2004 would have increased by 7.3 percent over the comparable prior period.
MINNEAPOLIS, October 21, 2004 -
 
Net sales for the third quarter increased 7.5 percent to $711.9 million including a 2.1 percent benefit from currency effects.  In addition, the impact from acquisitions made during the past 12 months represented a 1.7 percent increase in sales.
 
"Bemis is delivering solid performance in a difficult market environment," said Jeff Curler, Bemis Company President and Chief Executive Officer. "Higher petrochemical feedstock costs have significantly increased the price of polymer resins and adhesives, the primary raw materials for our business segments.  While this increase in costs is challenging the industry, the Bemis business model has a long-term history of success through various market cycles.  We remain confident in our ability to deliver value to our customers and meet our performance objectives."
 
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Flexible Packaging
 
Flexible packaging, representing about 80 percent of total company net sales, reported net sales of $571.7 million in the third quarter, an increase of 7.3 percent compared to the same quarter in 2003.  This includes currency effects of about 1.7 percent.  Our acquisition in Mexico in May 2004 contributed 1.4 percent to sales growth.  Operating profit for the third quarter of 2004 was $74.6 million or 13.1 percent of net sales, compared to $61.5 million or 11.5 percent of net sales for the third quarter of 2003.  During the third quarter of 2003, Bemis closed three flexible packaging manufacturing facilities and recorded restructuring and related charges of $10.8 million as part of a restructuring plan announced in July 2003.  Excluding the impact of these charges, operating profit for the third quarter of 2003 would have been $72.3 million, or 13.6 percent of net sales.
 
Commenting on the flexible packaging business segment, Curler noted, "Our diversified customer base and market exposure provide a strong base of business for our flexible packaging business segment.  Rising raw material prices are pressuring operating margins across the industry.  In this difficult environment, our business is strong and growing as customers seek out packaging innovation to increase market share and reduce total system cost.  Increased unit volumes in packaging sold into meat and cheese, confectionery and snack food, frozen foods and medical device markets reflects this focus on new products and convenience packaging.  This quarter we also completed the installation of new multilayer film capacity in our European operations.  Our flexible packaging segment is well positioned to strengthen its global market share and improve profitability in 2005."
 
Pressure Sensitive Materials
 
Net sales for the third quarter for our pressure sensitive materials business segment were $140.2 million, an 8.3 percent increase from the third quarter of 2003.  Currency effects accounted for about 3.6 percent sales growth, and a small graphics products acquisition in November 2003 contributed about 2.8 percent of the sales growth.  Operating profit of $7.9 million or 5.7 percent of net sales for the quarter improved from the third quarter of 2003 when operating profit was $4.0 million or 3.1 percent of net sales.  During the third quarter of 2004, operating profit for the pressure
sensitive materials segment was reduced by restructuring and related charges of $1.1 million.  Excluding the impact of these charges, operating profit for the third quarter of 2004 would have been $9.0 million or 6.4 percent of net sales.
 
"Our pressure sensitive materials business has doubled its operating profit compared to the third quarter of 2003," said Curler.  "The restructuring activities implemented earlier in the year are delivering improved operating efficiencies and cost savings to the bottom line.  We expect our focus on new product development and niche markets to drive sales growth and improve sales mix in the future."
 
Other Costs (Income), Net
 
Other costs and income includes a $2.2 million increase in equity income from the Company's Brazilian flexible packaging joint venture.  This increase reflects improved profitability of the joint venture operations and an increase in equity ownership from 33 percent to 45 percent in January 2004.  In the third quarter of 2003, restructuring and related costs totaling $5.5 million were included in other costs and income.
 
Capital Structure
 
Total debt was $585 million compared to the year-end 2003 balance of $590 million.  Debt to total capitalization was 29.3 percent at September 30, 2004, slightly lower than the 31.4 percent level reported at December 31, 2003.  During the first nine months of 2004, Bemis employed its strong cash flows to finance a 14 percent increase in its quarterly cash dividend, a $31 million acquisition in Mexico, a $40 million voluntary contribution to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans, and a 31 percent increase in capital expenditures to support its North American and European growth initiatives.
 
On September 2, 2004, Bemis renegotiated its bank credit facilities used to back up its commercial paper program.  There are eight banks participating in this new five-year bank credit facility that provides $500 million of credit and expires in September 2009.  Management expects this facility to be sufficient for its commercial paper financing needs over the term of the agreement.
 
Fourth Quarter 2004 Earnings Outlook
 
The current environment of increasing raw material costs represents a formidable challenge to the industry.  Management is confident that Bemis' existing business strategy appropriately accommodates raw material pricing trends and minimizes the impact on the company's long-term performance objectives.  In light of these market conditions, m
anagement expects fourth quarter 2004 earnings per share to be comparable to the third quarter 2004 levels.
 
Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter are expected to be $40 to $45 million.  This increased level of capital spending is consistent with management's guidance of $140 to $145 million of capital expenditures in 2004 and reflects the timing of payments on planned capital projects.
