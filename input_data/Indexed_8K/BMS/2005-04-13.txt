FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
BEMIS UPDATES FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS OUTLOOK
 
MINNEAPOLIS, April 11, 2005 - Bemis Company, Inc. (NYSE-BMS) announced today that it expects first quarter diluted earnings per share to be about 25 percent below its previous guidance.  Bemis had expected first quarter 2005 earnings per share to be comparable to earnings for the first quarter of 2004 of $0.40 per share.
 
Based upon preliminary results reported after the close of the quarter, while flexible packaging net sales excluding acquisitions is expected to increase about 7 percent compared to the first quarter of 2004, operating profit in the flexible packaging business segment is well below original expectations.
 
"During periods of rapidly rising resin costs, timing can have a significant impact on short-term operating margins," said Jeff Curler, President and Chief Executive Officer of Bemis Company.  "While operating results for the first quarter incorporated higher selling prices consistent with our normal pricing strategy, resin cost increases that occurred late in the fourth quarter of 2004 and during the first quarter of 2005 have temporarily outpaced our ability to adjust related selling prices.  The first quarter of each year is normally the weakest reporting period for both sales and operating profit.  Profit trends are expected to improve through the balance of the year.
 
"We will update our 2005 total year guidance as necessary in our first quarter earning announcement on April 21, after the detailed quarterly results become available.  Competition in our flexible packaging markets remains strong as customers seek to manage higher package prices.  Our focus continues to be to utilize technology to deliver high quality products and superior customer service that achieves the most competitive total system cost and improves market share results for our customers."
