ITEM 1.01.  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
 
On October 25, 2005, the board of directors of Bemis Company, Inc. (the "Company") approved new Management Agreements which will be entered into with the principal executive officers of the Company.  These agreements will provide certain payments to such executives if they terminate employment involuntarily (or resign following a reduction of pay or duties) in connection with a change of control of the Company.  The amount payable under such circumstances will be three times the individual's annual pay (including salary, bonus and estimated value of fringe benefits).  In addition, the terminating individual will receive a cash payment equivalent to his most recent annual grant of equity units under the Company's stock incentive plan.  These agreements differ from agreements previously in effect primarily as follows: (1) The new agreements define change of control as acquisition of 20% ownership interest in Company; (2) The old agreements had a fixed term, the new agreements do not; (3) The new agreements compensate for the estimated value of fringe benefits and cash equivalent of one annual grant of equity units; and (4) The new agreements strengthen the executive's rights if he or she is terminated shortly before change of control, or if the Company or its successor fails to pay amounts owed under the agreement.
