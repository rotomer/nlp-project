On December 22, 2005, Bemis Company, Inc. (the "Company"), made the following changes to the Bemis Retirement Plan (the "BRP"), which is the Company's defined benefit pension plan for non-bargaining unit employees:
 
Employees hired in 2005 or later will not be eligible to participate in the BRP.
 - 
                 
 
BRP participants who are under age 40 or whose age and length of service total less than 60 on December 31, 2005, will not receive additional credited service after 2005 for purposes of determining pension benefits.
 - 
                 
 
Employees over age 40 whose age and service total 60 or more as of December 31, 2005, will continue receiving benefit accruals under the BRP as previously in effect.  Employees whose future pension accruals are reduced or eliminated as a result of this change will be eligible to receive new retirement contributions effective January 1, 2006, through the Company's defined contribution plans.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
