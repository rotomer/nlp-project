FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
BEMIS COMPANY REPORTS RECORD SALES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER 2006; RAISES GUIDANCE FOR TOTAL YEAR
 
Bemis Company, Inc. (NYSE-BMS) today reported quarterly diluted earnings of $0.35 per share for the first quarter ended March 31, 2006, which included $0.07 per share of restructuring and related charges. Excluding the impact of restructuring and related charges, earnings per share would have been $0.42 per share for the first quarter of 2006 compared to $0.30 for the same quarter of 2005. First quarter net sales increased 8.4 percent to a record $901.6 million from $831.9 million in the prior year.
MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA / NEENAH, WISCONSIN, April 27, 2006 
 
"I am pleased to report record sales and strong operating performance this quarter," said Jeff Curler, Bemis Company Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We are enjoying double-digit volume increases in several high value-added flexible packaging markets. The growth strategy implemented in 2005 by our pressure sensitive materials team is gaining momentum and delivering double-digit sales growth and improved operating results. Overall, our customers are excited about new product innovation, and we are carefully managing this sales growth to achieve steady profit improvement. New cost control efforts implemented in 2005 will continue to improve results in 2006. We have completed the announcement of facilities consolidation efforts and expect to recognize cost synergies as business is consolidated into more efficient plants. In light of these improvements and the strength of our prospects, we are raising our expectations for total year 2006 earnings per share."
 
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
 
Flexible Packaging
 
Flexible packaging, which represented about 82 percent of total company net sales during the quarter, reported record net sales of $740.2 million in the first quarter, an increase of 7.6 percent compared to the same quarter in 2005. Currency effects accounted for 2.2 percent of sales growth. Operating profit for the first quarter of 2006 was $70.8 million, which included restructuring and related charges of $11.0 million. Restructuring and related charges reflect the costs associated with facility consolidation efforts that include the planned closure of five flexible packaging plants. Operating profit for the first quarter of 2005 was $69.9 million. Excluding restructuring and related charges, operating profit as a percentage of net sales would have increased to 11.1 percent from 10.2 percent a year ago.
 
Commenting on the flexible packaging business segment results for the quarter, Curler said, "We are enjoying solid volume growth in most of our higher value-added product markets this quarter, including meat and cheese, dry foods like cereal and coffee, medical device products, and multipacks for products like bottled water. Overall flexible packaging unit volume is down modestly as we continue to experience year-over-year decreases in more price-sensitive markets where innovation is less important. Our customers are excited about our new products for the European market, and we have identified opportunities that will transform sales mix in that region to include higher value-added products. Packaging innovation continues to be a top priority for customers worldwide. At Bemis, we are leading with new ideas that will strengthen our market position around the globe."
 
Pressure Sensitive Materials
 
First quarter net sales from the pressure sensitive materials business segment were $161.4 million, a 12.2 percent increase from the first quarter of 2005. Currency effects reduced net sales by about 4.3 percent compared to the prior year. Operating profit of $14.7 million included restructuring and related charges of $0.3 million related to the announced closure of one plant. Excluding the impact of these charges, operating profit would have been $15.0 million or 9.3 percent of net sales for the quarter compared to the first quarter of 2005 when operating profit would have been $7.7 million or 5.4 percent of net sales.
 
Commenting on the results of this business segment, Curler said, "Our pressure sensitive materials business has improved substantially over the past few years. Strong unit volume growth in label, graphic and technical product lines improved production efficiency and sales mix compared to last year. Our new products have impressed customers and created growth opportunities in each of these markets. This team uses a well-established six sigma approach to continuously improve cost management and customer service, and we are clearly seeing the benefits on the operating profit line. Our goal continues to be to regain the strong profitability levels that this business achieved in the past and to concentrate on unit volume growth in the higher margin graphics and technical product lines."
 
Restructuring and related charges
 
During the first quarter, the Company announced the planned closure of five flexible packaging facilities and one pressure sensitive materials facility in order to consolidate production capacity and improve overall cost structure and efficiency. Restructuring and
 
related charges incurred during the first quarter totaled $11.3 million, of which $6.8 million primarily reflects accelerated depreciation and is recorded in cost of sales. The remaining $4.5 million charge relates to employee costs and is recorded in other costs (income).
 
Other Costs (Income), Net
 
Net other costs increased to $2.3 million this quarter from $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2005, primarily reflecting the impact of $4.5 million of restructuring and related charges partially offset by $2.0 million of interest income.
 
Capital Structure
 
Total debt to total capitalization was 36.4 percent at March 31, 2006, compared to 35.8 percent at December 31, 2005. Total debt as of March 31, 2006 was $889.7 million, an increase of $45.6 million from December 31, 2005. Increased borrowing reflects higher levels of working capital at the end of the first quarter as the business prepares for the seasonally strong second quarter. During the first quarter of 2006, Bemis also repurchased 600,000 shares of common stock in the open market for $17.8 million under a 10b5-1 plan established to offset the dilutive impact of stock awards on an annual basis. As of March 31, 2006, the remaining balance of the Board authorization for common stock repurchases is 2.2 million shares.
 
2006 Earnings Outlook
 
Bemis expects second quarter 2006 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.41 per share including a restructuring charge of $0.06 per share. Total year 2006 earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.59 to $1.69, including about $0.16 per share of restructuring and related charges. Excluding the impact of restructuring and related charges, total year earnings guidance for 2006 would be $1.75 to $1.85 per share. This is an improvement of $0.10 per share from management's previous guidance announced in January of 2006 and reflects sustained productivity improvements initiated in 2005 in addition to cost savings resulting from 2006 facilities consolidation efforts. Management continues to expect capital expenditures to be in the $175 to $185 million range for 2006.
