FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BEMIS COMPANY REPORTS RECORD QUARTERLY SALES AND EARNINGS PER SHARE
 Bemis Company, Inc. (NYSE-BMS) today reported quarterly diluted earnings of $0.46 per share for the second quarter ended June 30, 2006, which included $0.05 per share of restructuring and related charges.  Excluding the impact of restructuring and related charges, earnings would have been $0.51 per share for the second quarter of 2006 compared to $0.38 per share for the same quarter of 2005, a 34.2 percent improvement.  Second quarter net sales increased 6.1 percent to a record $933.8 million from $879.9 million in the prior year.
NEENAH, WISCONSIN, July 27, 2006
Commenting on the results of the second quarter, Jeff Curler, Bemis Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Bemis' solid results for the second quarter and the first half of the year reflect strong market demand in key product lines and successful cost management.  Innovative new products are creating opportunities that will drive margin growth over the next several years.  I am confident in our ability to achieve strong 2006 results for our shareholders and to capitalize on prospects that will deliver solid growth for Bemis in the future."
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Flexible Packaging
Flexible packaging, which represented about 82 percent of total Company net sales during the quarter, reported record net sales of $767.5 million in the second quarter, an increase of 5.9 percent compared to the same quarter in 2005.  Currency effects accounted for sales growth of 2.1 percent.  Operating profit for the second quarter of 2006 was $88.6 million, or 11.5 percent of net sales, which included restructuring and related charges of $8.7 million.  Restructuring and related charges reflect the costs associated with our previously announced facility consolidation efforts that include the closure of five flexible packaging plants.  Operating profit for the second quarter of 2005 was $80.7 million.  Excluding restructuring and related charges, operating profit as a percentage of net sales would have increased to 12.7 percent  from 11.2 percent a year ago.
Commenting on the flexible packaging business segment results for the quarter, Curler said, "During the second quarter, our flexible packaging plants experienced strong, steady production volumes that allowed many of our plants to optimize manufacturing efficiencies and capitalize on recent productivity improvements.  Increasing demand for packaging for expanding markets such as meat and cheese, multipacks, medical products, dry foods, and liquids is creating opportunities for high margin growth as new capacity becomes available.  Moderating raw material costs also contributed to higher operating margins during the second quarter.  Material costs are expected to rise in the second half of the year, which would negatively impact operating margins in the near term."
Pressure Sensitive Materials
Second quarter net sales from the pressure sensitive materials business segment were $166.3 million, a 7.1 percent increase from the second quarter of 2005.  Currency translation was insignificant to sales growth for the quarter.  Operating profit of $14.8 million, or 8.9 percent of net sales, included restructuring and related charges of $0.1 million related to the previously announced closure of one plant.  Excluding the impact of these charges, operating profit would have been $14.9 million or 9.0 percent of net sales for the quarter compared to the second quarter of 2005 when operating profit was $9.3 million or 6.0 percent of net sales.
"Our pressure sensitive materials business continued to experience volume growth during the second quarter," Curler noted when asked about the sustained improvements in the performance of this segment.  "Both sequential and year-over-year quarterly volume increases are evidence of a successful growth strategy that reflects our focus on innovation and manufacturing excellence.  While operating margins in this segment will be challenged during the second half of the year with increased raw material costs, we continue to expect average 2006 operating margins to be close to 8 percent, a substantial improvement from 2005 levels."
Restructuring and related charges
In January of 2006, the Company announced the planned closure of five flexible packaging facilities and one pressure sensitive materials facility in order to consolidate production capacity and improve overall cost structure and efficiency.  Restructuring and related charges incurred during the second quarter totaled $8.8 million, of which $4.4 million relates primarily to accelerated depreciation and is recorded as a component of cost of sales.  The remaining $4.4 million charge relates primarily to employee costs and is recorded as a component of other costs (income).
 
Capital Structure
Total debt to total capitalization was 34.4 percent at June 30, 2006, compared to 35.7 percent at December 31, 2005.   Total debt as of June 30, 2006 was $845.8 million, almost equal to the balance of $844.1 million at December 31, 2005.  Strong cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2006, were used to support seasonally higher working capital levels at the end of the second quarter, dividend payments, a strong capital expenditure program, and first quarter share repurchases.   Management expects cash flow from operations in the second half of 2006 to be comparable to the first six months.
2006 Earnings Outlook
Bemis expects third quarter 2006 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.41 to $0.44 per share including a restructuring charge of $0.04 per share.  Total year 2006 diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.63 to $1.68, including about $0.18 per share of restructuring and related charges.  Excluding the impact of restructuring and related charges, third quarter earnings guidance would be $0.45 to $0.48 per share and total year earnings guidance for 2006 would be $1.81 to $1.86 per share.  This represents the high end of management's previous guidance for 2006 and reflects sustained productivity improvements initiated in 2005 in addition to estimated cost savings resulting from 2006 facilities consolidation efforts.  Management continues to expect capital expenditures to be in the $175 to $185 million range for 2006.
