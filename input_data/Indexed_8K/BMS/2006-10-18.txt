EXHBIT 99.1
October 13, 2006
This notice is to inform you that the Bemis 401(k) Plan for Bargaining Unit Employees will be changing plan service providers. As a result, some investment options for the retirement plan will be changed and you temporarily will be unable to reallocate investments in your individual accounts or obtain a withdrawal or distribution from the plan.
This period, during which you will be unable to exercise these rights otherwise available under the plan, is called a "blackout period." Whether or not you are planning retirement in the near future, we encourage you to carefully consider how this blackout period may affect your retirement planning, as well as your overall financial plan.
The blackout period for the plan is expected to begin at 3 p.m., November 15, 2006, and conclude the week beginning December 17, 2006. The blackout period will occur in two phases as follows:
Phase I  Initial Blackout 
Transaction Submission Deadline
November 15, 2006, at 3 p.m., Central time
You must submit all necessary forms and/or requests and related information to USBank no later than November 15, 2006 at 3 p.m., Central time to be sure your request for a withdrawal or distribution will be completed before the conversion to JPMorgan as recordkeeper.
All other access to your account, including the ability to make requests for investment election changes, deferral rate changes, and fund transfers will remain available until the full blackout period begins.
Phase II: Full Blackout 
No Account Access
November 22, 2006, at 3 p.m., Central time
On November 22, 2006, at 3 p.m., Central time, you will not have any access to your account until the blackout period ends during the week beginning December 17, 2006. You will receive notification via mail when the blackout period has ended.
In addition to the inability to obtain a withdrawal or distribution from the plan, during the blackout period you will be unable to direct or diversify the assets held in your plan account. For your long-term retirement security, you should give careful consideration to the importance of a well-balanced and diversified investment portfolio, taking into account all your assets, income and investments.
For this reason, it is very important that you review and consider the appropriateness of your current investments prior to the blackout period.
You should be aware that there is a risk to holding substantial portions of your assets in the securities of any one company, as individual securities tend to have wider price swings, up and down, in short periods of time, than investments in diversified funds. Stocks that have wide price swings might have a large loss during the blackout period, and you would not be able to initiate the sale of such stocks from your account during the blackout period.
If you have any questions concerning this notice, you should contact JPMorgan Retirement Plan Services at . Representatives are available weekdays from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Central time. The TDD number for those with a hearing impairment is 800-345-1833.
800-345-2345
The enclosed Special Tax Notice Regarding Plan Payments is a required tax notice. Please keep this for your records. No action is required on your part at this time.
