ITEM 2.02.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On January 25, 2007, Bemis Company, Inc. issued a press release containing its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, a copy of which is furnished as Exhibit 99 to this report.  Earnings guidance for 2007 for Bemis Company is included with this press release and will be available during the regular earnings release conference call scheduled for Thursday, January 25, 2007, at 10:00 a.m. (EDT). Individuals may listen to the call on the Internet at www.bemis.com under "Investor Relations."  However, they are urged to check the website ahead of time to ensure their computers are configured for the audio stream.  Instruction for obtaining the required, free, downloadable software are available in a pre-event system test on the site.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The press release furnished as an exhibit to this report contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including:
        Segment operating profit as adjusted
        Segment operating profit as adjusted as a percentage of net sales
        Diluted earnings per share as adjusted
Each of these measures excludes from the most directly comparable GAAP measures the impact of relevant restructuring and related charges or income, purchase accounting finalization adjustments, the year-end date change for our foreign subsidiary, and additional income tax on repatriated earnings.  Management believes these adjusted measures are useful to investors because they assist an investor's understanding of the impact of each of these items on the comparability of the Company's operations from year-to-year.  Excluding the impact of these items also enables investors to compare our underlying operational results and trends before other charges and income items that are considered by management to be non-recurring and do not relate to the Company's core operations.  Management uses these adjusted measures to monitor and evaluate operating performance and also for internal planning purposes.  These measures are subject to certain limitations because they do not reflect all charges or income items that were actually recognized by the Company in accordance with GAAP.  As a result, investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP.  In addition, these adjusted measures may not be calculated in the same manner as adjusted measures presented by other companies.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BEMIS COMPANY REPORTS 2006 RESULTS
Total Year Earnings per share increase 9.3 percent;
Operating cash flow hits record high of $338 million
 Bemis Company, Inc. (NYSE-BMS) today reported quarterly diluted earnings of $0.39 per share for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006.  Excluding the impact of $0.03 per share of restructuring and related charges, diluted earnings would have been $0.42 per share for the fourth quarter of 2006.  Diluted earnings per share for the full year 2006 were $1.65, a 9.3 percent increase from $1.51 per share reported in 2005.  Excluding the effect of special items from 2005 and 2006 as described in the attached schedule, "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Data", diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2006, would have increased by 17.8 percent.
NEENAH, WISCONSIN, January 25, 2007
Commenting on the results of 2006, Jeff Curler, Bemis Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We have accomplished a great deal in 2006.  Sales and earnings growth are back on track.  We have improved our cost structure with our 2006 restructuring activities.  Cash flow from operations reached a record high.  We have managed costs well and improved production efficiencies in 2006, and we have additional opportunities for cost improvement in 2007.  More importantly, we are delivering new, innovative products to our customers and marketing our proprietary products on a global basis.  Bemis is well positioned to participate in the growing global economies, and we are looking forward to expanding into new markets such as case-ready meat and pharmaceutical packaging."
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
Quarter Ended December 31, 2006
Quarterly diluted earnings per share were $0.39 for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006.  Results include a $0.03 per share impact from restructuring and related charges.  Results for the quarter reflect a lower income tax rate attributable primarily to the final determination of the benefits provided under The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.  Quarterly diluted earnings per share were $0.42 for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2005.  In 2005, the year-end of the European subsidiary in our pressure sensitive materials business segment changed from November 30 to December 31, adding $0.02 per share to the results of the quarter.  Results for the fourth quarter of 2005 also include the impact of additional tax expense of approximately $0.06 per share related to the repatriation of international subsidiary earnings under The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, partially offset by a favorable impact of $0.03 per share related to adjustments for the finalization of the Dixie Toga purchase accounting.  (See attached schedule: "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Data".)  The effect of currency translation was not significant to either period.
Bemis recorded fourth quarter net sales of $900.6 million in 2006 compared to $892.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, a 1.0 percent increase.  Excluding the impact of the 2005 change in year-end for a foreign subsidiary, net sales for the fourth quarter of 2006 would have increased by 3.8 percent.  Currency translation increased net sales for the quarter by about 2.4 percent.
Year Ended December 31, 2006
For the full year 2006, Bemis reported diluted earnings of $1.65 per share.  This result includes restructuring and related charges of $0.18 per share.  Earnings per share results for the full year 2005 totaled $1.51, including approximately $0.05 per share of tax charges related to the international earnings repatriation.  (See attached schedule: "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Data".)  Excluding the impact of restructuring activities and special tax charges, earnings per share increased 17.8 percent in 2006.
This year's net sales of $3.6 billion increased 4.8 percent over net sales in 2005 of $3.5 billion.  Excluding the impact of the change in year-end of the European subsidiary included in 2005, net sales in 2006 increased 5.3 percent.  The impact of currency translation was a benefit to net sales growth in 2006 of 1.8 percent.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Flexible Packaging
Flexible packaging, which represented about 82 percent of total Company net sales during the quarter, reported net sales of $743.3 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 3.2 percent compared to the same quarter in 2005.  Currency effects accounted for sales growth of 2.0 percent.  Segment operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $83.6 million, or 11.2 percent of net
sales, which included restructuring and related charges of $4.1 million.  Restructuring and related charges reflect the costs associated with our previously announced facility consolidation and capacity reduction efforts.  Segment operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $93.1 million, including a $5.4 million favorable impact related to the finalization of purchase accounting.  (See attached schedule: "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Data".)  Excluding restructuring and related charges from 2006 and the purchase accounting adjustment from the fourth quarter of 2005, segment operating profit as a percentage of net sales would have decreased to 11.8 percent from 12.2 percent a year ago.   Currency translation increased operating profit by $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2006.
For the total year, net sales of flexible packaging increased 5.1 percent to $3.0 billion.  Currency effects accounted for sales growth of 2.1 percent.  Operating profit increased to $335.1 million, or 11.2 percent of net sales, including restructuring and related charges of $29.0 million.  Excluding restructuring and related charges, total year segment operating profit would have been $364.1 million or 12.1 percent of net sales compared to $333.3 million, or 11.7 percent of net sales in 2005.   The impact of currency translation was a $6.5 million benefit to operating profit for 2006.
Commenting on the flexible packaging business segment results for the quarter, Curler said, "This year we reported healthy sales growth in nearly all of our flexible packaging markets.  Total year operating margins have improved, benefiting from restructuring related savings, improved cost management, enhanced production efficiencies and better sales mix.  The fourth quarter ended weaker than we had expected as orders and shipments slowed down during the month of December.  We attribute slower orders to a sharp decline in energy prices, motivating some customers to delay orders in an attempt to obtain lower pricing.  We also believe that slower shipping in December may reflect year-end inventory de-stocking by certain customers.  We expect this weakness to be short-lived as customers begin to rebuild inventory levels to meet seasonally stronger demand for products early in 2007.
In 2006, our product teams worked closely with customers to support their growth initiatives with value-added packaging that incorporates consumer convenience features and high performance film structures.  In 2007, our customers will experience another strong year of new products from Bemis.  We are expanding our product reach with the introduction of a broad array of new products and packaging features that will further strengthen our competitive position and improve sales mix."
Pressure Sensitive Materials
Fourth quarter net sales from the pressure sensitive materials business segment were $157.3 million.  During the fourth quarter of 2005, the year-end of the European subsidiary in this segment was changed, creating a 13-month reporting period in 2005.  Excluding the impact of the change in the reporting period during the fourth quarter of 2005, net sales for the fourth quarter of 2006 would have increased 6.8 percent from the prior year.  Currency effects accounted for sales growth of 4.3 percent.  Segment operating profit of $9.2 million or 5.8 percent of net sales compared to the fourth quarter of 2005 when segment operating profit was $14.7 million or 8.6 percent of net sales.  Operating profit in the fourth quarter of 2005 included a restructuring gain of $0.5 million.  Excluding the impact of the extra month included in 2005 and restructuring and related charges and gains from operating profit of both periods, operating profit would have been $9.2 million or 5.9 percent of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to $11.0 million or 7.4 percent of net sales for the fourth quarter of 2005.  The impact of currency translation was insignificant to fourth quarter operating profit in 2006.  Operating profit was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs in the fourth quarter of 2006.
For the total year, net sales of pressure sensitive materials were $639.3 million, a 3.4 percent increase from the net sales of 2005.  Excluding the impact of the additional month of sales of the European subsidiary included in 2005, net sales in 2006 increased 6.6 percent, reflecting strong growth in each of the three product lines.  Currency effects accounted for sales growth of 0.7 percent.  Operating profit was $50.1 million or 7.8 percent of net sales in 2006, including restructuring and related charges of $1.0 million.  This compares to operating profit of $41.3 million or 6.7 percent of net sales in 2005, which included restructuring and related gains of $1.5 million.  Excluding the impact of restructuring and related activities from each year and the extra month of European subsidiary results in 2005, operating profit as a percent of net sales would have been 8.0 percent in 2006 and 6.5 percent in 2005.   This profit improvement reflects the improved sales mix and effective cost management efforts during the year.  The impact of currency translation was insignificant to operating profit in 2006.
Commenting on the results of the pressure sensitive materials business segment, Curler noted, "This business continues to strengthen as we execute a growth strategy that incorporates customer-focused innovation with six sigma-driven manufacturing excellence.  This year we have improved our competitive position in label products, and we're growing our value-added graphic and technical product lines.  In 2007, we will be introducing new innovative products that will improve performance and reduce costs.   We are adding capacity in North America and Europe for our higher margin graphic and technical product lines.  Growth in these product lines will further improve profitability in this segment."
Restructuring and Related Charges
In January of 2006, the Company announced the planned closure of five flexible packaging facilities and one pressure sensitive materials facility in order to consolidate production capacity and improve overall cost structure and efficiency.  These efforts were substantially complete as of December 31, 2006.  Restructuring and related charges incurred during the fourth quarter totaled $5.7 million, of which $0.9 million primarily reflects accelerated depreciation and is recorded as a component of cost of products sold.  The remaining $4.8 million primarily reflects employee-related costs and is recorded as a component of other costs (income).
Other Costs (Income), Net
For the fourth quarter of 2006, other costs and income primarily includes $4.8 million of costs resulting from the 2006 restructuring activities which are more than offset by $5.4 million of financial income.
Capital Structure
Total debt to total capitalization was 33.0 percent at December 31, 2006, compared to 35.8 percent at December 31, 2005.   Total debt as of December 31, 2006 was $789.8 million, a decrease of $54.3 million from the balance of $844.1 million at December 31, 2005.  Effective December 31, 2006, Bemis adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, "Accounting for Pensions", which had the effect of reducing stockholder's equity by $63.8 million and deferred taxes by $40.0 million.  This adjustment increased the ratio of debt to total capitalization at December 31, 2006 by 1.2 percent.  Cash flow from operating activities totaled a record $338.3 million in 2006, a 21 percent increase from 2005.  Strong cash flows throughout 2006 were used to support increased dividend payments, a $158.8 million capital expenditures program, a $17.8 million share repurchase program, and $54.3 million of debt reduction.  During the fourth quarter of 2006, Bemis made tax-deductible, voluntary pension contributions totaling $24.0 million to its U.S. pension plans.
2007 Earnings Outlook
The 2006 initiatives that focused on quality-oriented cost reduction efforts and productivity initiatives to improve return on assets are expected to continue to drive improved profitability in 2007.  Bemis expects first quarter 2007 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.44 to $0.46.  The first quarter is historically the slowest sales volume quarter of the year for Bemis' markets.  For the full year 2007, management expects diluted earnings per share to be in the $1.98 to $2.08 range.
Capital Expenditures
Total capital expenditures for 2006 were $158.8 million, considerably below the capital spending levels of 2005 and the original estimate for 2006.  This decrease reflects the timing of expenditures and a shift of spending into 2007.  The expansion of Bemis' medical packaging capacity in North America, Northern Ireland and Malaysia is scheduled to be completed during 2007.  In addition, investments in new capacity in high growth product lines will align production capacity with expected demand in 2007.  Including the remaining capital spending for 2006 projects, capital expenditures for 2007 are anticipated to be in the $175 to $185 million range.
