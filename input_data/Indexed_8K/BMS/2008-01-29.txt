ITEM 2.02.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
                                               
On January 29, 2008, Bemis Company, Inc. issued a press release containing its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2007, a copy of which is furnished as Exhibit 99 to this report.  Earnings guidance for 2008 for Bemis Company is included with this press release and will be available during the regular earnings release conference call scheduled for Tuesday, January 29, 2008, at 10:00 a.m. (EST). Individuals may listen to the call on the Internet at www.bemis.com under "Investor Relations."  However, they are urged to check the website ahead of time to ensure their computers are configured for the audio stream.  Instructions for obtaining the required, free, downloadable software are available in a pre-event system test on the site.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The press release furnished as an exhibit to this report contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including:
 
Segment operating profit as adjusted
                 
 
Segment operating profit as adjusted as a percentage of net sales
                 
 
Diluted earnings per share as adjusted
                 
 
Each of these measures excludes from the most directly comparable GAAP measures the impact of relevant restructuring and related charges or income, and the additional income tax benefit related to a dividend from a foreign subsidiary.  Management believes these adjusted measures are useful to investors because they assist an investor's understanding of the impact of each of these items on the comparability of the Company's operations from year-to-year.  Excluding the impact of these items also enables investors to compare our underlying operational results and trends before other charges and income items that are considered by management to be non-recurring and do not relate to the Company's core operations.  Management uses these adjusted measures to monitor and evaluate operating performance and also for internal planning purposes.  These measures are subject to certain limitations because they do not reflect all charges or income items that were actually recognized by the Company in accordance with GAAP.  As a result, investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP.  In addition, these adjusted measures may not be calculated in the same manner as adjusted measures presented by other companies.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
BEMIS COMPANY REPORTS 4th QUARTER AND TOTAL YEAR 2007 RESULTS
 
Achieves Record Cash Flow from Operating Activities for 2007
Prepares to Celebrate Bemis' 150 Year Anniversary
 
 Bemis Company, Inc. (NYSE-BMS) today reported quarterly diluted earnings of $0.42 per share for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2007, including a $0.02 per share tax benefit in the quarter related to dividends from a foreign subsidiary.  Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $0.39 per share, including restructuring and related charges totaling $0.03 per share.  Diluted earnings per share for the full year 2007 were $1.74, a 5.6 percent increase from $1.65 per share reported in 2006.  As noted above, a tax benefit related to dividends from a foreign subsidiary was included in results for 2007.  Restructuring and related charges reduced results for 2006 by a total of $0.18 per share.  Excluding the effect of these special items from 2007 and 2006 as described in the attached schedule, "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Data", diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2007, would have decreased by 5.8 percent.
NEENAH, WISCONSIN, January 29, 2008
 
Commenting on the results of 2007, Jeffrey Curler, Bemis Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "This was a challenging year for our business.  We did not anticipate the negative impact that the current economic environment would have on consumer demand for food products in 2007 in the United States.   In response, we have made adjustments to our operations to reflect the slower demand in the marketplace.  Current general economic assessments forecast that the coming year will be equally as challenging.  Consumer budgets are being squeezed by higher energy costs, higher food prices, and in some cases, increased housing-related costs associated with mortgage market issues.  We also expect raw material cost increases during the first half of the coming year.  In 2008, Bemis will continue our program of aggressively managing costs and our commitment to passing the higher raw material costs through higher selling prices as rapidly as possible.  We also have substantially reduced our capital expenditure plan in 2008, directing the time and talent of our business teams to drive the growth from our recent capital investments and focus on demonstrating valuable technology and product innovation to customers.  We continue to manage total system cost throughout the pipeline from supplier to consumer, and drive shareholder value momentum that will be sustained into the future."
 
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
 
Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $912.7 million, a 1.3 percent increase from net sales of $900.6 million for the same period of 2006.  Currency benefits contributed 5.0 percent to net sales for the fourth quarter.  For the full year, net sales were $3.6 billion including a currency translation benefit of $0.1 billion.  Excluding the impact of the currency translation, net sales would have decreased 3.1 percent.
 
Quarterly diluted earnings per share were $0.42 for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2007.  Results include a $0.02 per share tax benefit related to dividends from a foreign subsidiary.  Quarterly diluted earnings per share were $0.39 for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006.  In 2006, results included a $0.03 per share impact from restructuring and related charges.  For the full year 2007, Bemis reported diluted earnings of $1.74 per share.  This result includes the fourth quarter tax benefit of $0.02 per share discussed above.  Earnings per share results for the full year 2006 totaled $1.65, including restructuring and related charges of $0.18 per share.  Excluding the impact of restructuring activities and the tax benefit noted above, earnings per share would have decreased 5.8 percent in 2007.
 
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
 
Flexible Packaging
 
Flexible packaging, which represented about 83 percent of total Company net sales during the quarter, reported net sales of $754.8 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 1.6 percent compared to net sales of $743.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2006.  Currency related sales growth of 4.8 percent was partially offset by lower sales volumes in several markets.  Segment operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $83.3 million, or 11.0 percent of net sales, which included restructuring related income of $1.2 million.  Segment operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $83.6 million, or 11.2 percent of net sales, which included restructuring and related charges of $4.1 million.  Excluding the impact of restructuring and related activities, segment operating profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 10.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to 11.8 percent a year ago.   Currency benefits added $2.4 million to operating profit in the fourth quarter of 2007.
 
For the total year, flexible packaging net sales of $3.0 billion were approximately equal to 2006 net sales levels.  Currency effects accounted for sales growth of 3.1 percent during 2007.  Excluding the impact of currency, the decrease in net sales reflects generally lower sales volumes across a number of markets.  Operating profit increased to $346.6 million, or 11.5 percent of net sales, including restructuring related income of $1.5 million.  Excluding restructuring and related activities, total year segment operating profit would have been $345.1 million or 11.5 percent of net sales compared to $364.1 million, or 12.1 percent of net sales in 2006.   The impact of currency translation was a $7.3 million benefit to operating profit in 2007.
 
Commenting on the results of this business segment, Curler said, "We began 2007 anticipating modest growth with a focus on achieving continued improvements in operational efficiency.  Unfortunately, our food and consumer product end markets began to show signs of weaker demand levels as the year progressed.  At mid-year, we shifted the focus of our business units to reduce costs and improve the flexibility of our operations to better respond to fluctuating production levels resulting from slowing volume demands.  Our business teams have responded to this challenge, and we are prepared for 2008 with a more competitive cost structure and our state-of-the-art production facilities."
 
Pressure Sensitive Materials
 
Fourth quarter net sales from the pressure sensitive materials business segment were $157.8 million, comparable to net sales of $157.3 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006.  Currency effects accounted for 6.0 percent growth in 2007 fourth quarter net sales.  Segment operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $6.7 million, or 4.3 percent of net sales, compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 when segment operating profit was $9.2 million or 5.8 percent of net sales.  Currency benefits added $0.7 million to operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2007.
 
For the total year, net sales of pressure sensitive materials were $647.5 million, a 1.3 percent increase from the net sales of 2006.  Currency effects accounted for net sales growth of 4.5 percent.  Operating profit was $40.3 million or 6.2 percent of net sales in 2007.  This compares to operating profit of $50.1 million or 7.8 percent of net sales in 2006, which included restructuring and related charges of $1.0 million.  Excluding the impact of restructuring and related charges, operating profit as a percent of net sales would have been 6.2 percent in 2007 and 8.0 percent in 2006.   The impact of currency translation was a $2.5 million benefit to operating profit for 2007.
 
"Net sales of label products and technical products decreased in the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of softer economic conditions in the United States and the addition of industry capacity within the label products market," said Curler.  "This competitive environment for label products is challenging, but our focus on niche products combined with valued quality and customer service provides Bemis with a competitive advantage in the market.  Our technical products customers are dealing with their own economic challenges, specifically those with exposure to certain housing and medical markets.  Excluding the benefits of currency, our graphic products business, which had been growing nicely in 2006, leveled off in 2007, reflecting slower economic conditions.  We made fourth quarter adjustments to our production levels to accommodate this lower sales volume level in the near term and look forward to renewed earnings momentum in 2008."
 
Restructuring and Related Charges
 
In January of 2006, the Company announced the planned closure of five flexible packaging facilities and one pressure sensitive materials facility in order to consolidate production capacity and improve overall cost structure and efficiency.  These efforts were substantially complete as of December 31, 2006.  Total remaining costs incurred in 2007 were substantially offset by restructuring related gains.  For the fourth quarter of 2007, flexible packaging related restructuring income of $1.2 million was more than offset by $1.3 million of corporate restructuring and related costs, the net effect of which was recorded as a component of other costs (income).  For the total year 2007, other costs and income included charges of $1.5 million associated with corporate restructuring and related costs.  These charges were more than offset by net restructuring income of $1.8 million primarily related to our flexible packaging operations.  An additional flexible packaging restructuring related charge for $0.3 million was recorded as a component of cost of goods sold.
 
Other Costs (Income), Net
 
For the fourth quarter of 2007, other costs and income included $8.3 million of financial income compared to $5.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2006.  Fourth quarter restructuring and related charges of $0.1 million in 2007, and $4.7 million in 2006, reduced financial income in each period.
 
For the total year 2007, other costs and income included $28.3 million of financial income compared to $18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.  Restructuring and related charges totaled $18.6 million in 2006 compared to a net restructuring income of $0.3 million in 2007.
 
Capital Structure and Cash Flow from Operations
 
Total debt to total capitalization was 32.9 percent at December 31, 2007, compared to 33.0 percent at December 31, 2006.   Total debt as of December 31, 2007 was $843.3 million, an increase of $53.5 million from the balance of $789.8 million at December 31, 2006.  The increase in borrowing combined with record cash provided by operating activities of $399.4 million were used to fund share repurchases totaling $154.0 million, capital expenditures of $178.9 million, and dividend payments of $89.8 million for the year 2007.
 
An accelerated share repurchase program initiated in the third quarter of 2007 was completed and settled during the fourth quarter of 2007.  In total, the accelerated share repurchase program accomplished the repurchase of 4 million shares of Bemis common stock as of the effective date of August 3, 2007, at a total net price of $114.8 million.  Other share repurchases made earlier in 2007 totaled 1.2 million shares at a cost of $39.2 million.  As of December 31, 2007, the remaining share repurchase authorization from the Board of Directors was approximately 5.1 million shares.
 
2008 Earnings Outlook
 
"In 2008, we are proud to celebrate our 150 anniversary as a business and as an innovator in the packaging industry," said Curler.  "Few companies in North America can claim such an impressive achievement.  Throughout our history we have demonstrated that ingenuity and progressive ideas, resourcefulness, and perseverance deliver sustainable success over the long run.  We are well prepared to meet the challenges of 2008 and look forward to many successful years in the future."
th
 
Market conditions continue to be difficult to predict given the current economic environment and anticipated volatility in raw material costs.  Bemis remains focused on improving its cost structure to match anticipated production volume levels and strengthen its competitive position.  Management expects diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2008 to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.43.  The first quarter is historically the slowest sales volume quarter of the year for Bemis' markets.  For the full year 2008, management expects diluted earnings per share to be in the $1.78 to $1.88 range.
 
Capital Expenditures
 
In 2007, Bemis completed multiyear investments for new facilities for the medical and pharmaceutical markets, established a platform for polyester rigid packaging products, added converting capability in its Asia/Pacific operations, and added proprietary film production capacity for European markets.  With these strategic investments in place, Bemis is prepared for increased demand from these growth markets.  Total capital expenditures for 2007 were $178.9 million.  In 2008, management expects capital expenditures to be approximately $125 million.
