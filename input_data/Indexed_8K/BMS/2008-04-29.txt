FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
BEMIS COMPANY REPORTS 2008 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
 
NEENAH, WISCONSIN, April 29, 2008
 Bemis Company, Inc. (NYSE-BMS) today reported quarterly diluted earnings of $0.42 per share for the first quarter ended March 31, 2008, compared to $0.45 per share for the same quarter of 2007.  Net sales increased to $947.3 million for the first quarter of 2008, a 4.2 percent increase from $909.1 million for the same period of 2007.  Currency benefits contributed 5.1 percent to net sales for the quarter.
 
"This quarter we experienced rising raw material costs, especially with regard to our specialty resin and chemical inputs," said Henry Theisen, Bemis Company's President and Chief Executive Officer.  "In this environment, we continue to expand our product reach into new markets and geographies while maintaining a rigorous focus on cost management, waste reduction and production efficiency.  I am pleased to see stability and modest volume growth returning to our largest flexible packaging end markets and look forward to modest overall volume growth for the total year 2008."
 
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
 
Flexible Packaging
 
Flexible packaging, which represented about 83 percent of total Company net sales during the quarter, reported net sales of $781.6 million in the first quarter, a 5.2 percent increase compared to net sales of $743.2 million for the first quarter of 2007.  Currency related sales growth totaled 4.8 percent.  Segment operating profit for the first quarter of 2008 was $79.3 million, or 10.1 percent of net sales.  Segment operating profit for the first quarter of 2007 was $88.2 million, or 11.9 percent of net sales.  Currency benefits added $2.3 million to operating profit in the first quarter of 2008.  Lower operating profit reflects the impact of generally higher input costs in 2008 compared to the previous year.
 
Commenting on the flexible packaging segment results, Theisen said, "During the first quarter, we experienced higher specialty resin costs which negatively impacted operating profit levels in our flexible packaging business segment.   These and other inflationary cost pressures are being managed with selling price increases and profit improvement programs that we expect to result in improved performance for the remainder of the year.  Flexible packaging unit sales volume increased modestly compared to last year and to last quarter, which primarily reflects the scale up of new business awarded in 2007 and stabilizing consumer demand in North America.  We are encouraged by increased sales volume and mix improvements in our European flexible packaging business and are pleased with the start-up of our new medical device packaging plant in Northern Ireland.  Our continuing focus on cost management and productivity improvement will be critical to ensure that the benefits of improving volume levels deliver profit momentum to the flexible packaging segment in 2008."
 
Pressure Sensitive Materials
 
Net sales from the pressure sensitive materials business segment for the first quarter of 2008 were $165.7 million compared to $165.9 million in the first quarter of 2007.  The benefits of currency were offset by lower unit sales.  Segment operating profit for the first quarter of 2008 was $11.9 million, or 7.2 percent of net sales, compared to the first quarter of 2007 when segment operating profit was $14.3 million or 8.6 percent of net sales.  Currency benefits added $1.2 million to operating profit in the first quarter of 2008.
 
"Growth in our pressure sensitive materials segment is impacted by conditions in certain end markets and regional economies," said Theisen. "While our North American label product business is relatively stable, we are experiencing lower sales volumes in our higher margin technical product markets where customers with exposure to certain housing, industrial and medical markets are facing weak economic conditions. We continue to manage costs carefully through this difficult environment and look forward to the introduction of new products in 2008 which will further diversify our business and build momentum once the economy begins to recover."
 
Other Costs (Income), Net
 
For the first quarter of 2008, other costs and income included $7.7 million of financial income compared to $5.1 million for the first quarter of 2007.
 
Capital Structure
 
Total debt to total capitalization was 33.4 percent at March 31, 2008, compared to 32.9 percent at December 31, 2007.   Total debt as of March 31, 2008 was $875.8 million, an increase of $32.5 million from the balance of $843.3 million at December 31, 2007.  Cash flow from operations was $55.6 million in the first quarter of 2008.
 
Dividend Increase and Share Repurchase
 
In the first quarter, the board of directors approved a 4.8 percent increase in the quarterly dividend.  Bemis also repurchased one million shares of its common stock on the open market during the first quarter of 2008 for $26.8 million.
 
2008 Earnings Outlook
 
Management expects second quarter 2008 diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.44 to $0.47 per share.  Guidance for the full year 2008 remains unchanged at $1.78 to $1.88 per share.  Management continues to expect capital expenditures to be in the $125 million range for 2008.  Commenting on the outlook for the year, Theisen noted that the market conditions remain difficult to predict. "At Bemis, we are improving our cost structure and strengthening our competitive position across all of our markets.  We intend to react swiftly to the challenges of this dynamic, global economic environment and build positive performance momentum going forward."
