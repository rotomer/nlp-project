FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
BEMIS COMPANY REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2008 RESULTS
 
Bemis Company, Inc. (NYSE-BMS) today reported quarterly diluted earnings of $0.44 per share for the third quarter ended September 30, 2008, a 10.0 percent increase compared to $0.40 per share for the third quarter of 2007.  Net sales increased to a record $984.3 million for the third quarter of 2008, an 8.7 percent increase from $905.7 million for the same period of 2007.  Currency benefits contributed 2.9 percent to net sales for the quarter.
NEENAH, WISCONSIN, October 28, 2008 
 
"We enjoyed strong sales growth this quarter in the key markets where we have been investing," said Henry Theisen, Bemis Company's President and Chief Executive Officer.  "We have also responded aggressively to the escalating input costs this year.  In this challenging economic environment, attention to cost management and customer service is imperative.  Our business teams are successfully navigating the current global market conditions and are prepared to meet the challenges ahead."
 
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
 
Flexible Packaging
 
Flexible packaging, which represented about 84 percent of total Bemis net sales during the quarter, reported net sales of $826.4 million in the third quarter, a 10.9 percent increase compared to net sales of $745.4 million for the third quarter of 2007.  Currency related sales growth totaled 2.8 percent.  Segment operating profit for the third quarter of 2008 was $82.4 million, or 10.0 percent of net sales.  Segment operating profit for the third quarter of 2007 was $81.6 million, or 10.9 percent of net sales.  Currency benefits added $1.5 million to operating profit in the third quarter of 2008.  This quarter's operating profit reflects the impact of higher input costs incurred in 2008.
 
Commenting on the flexible packaging segment results, Theisen said, "Healthy sales growth in our flexible packaging segment was driven by a combination of volume growth and price increases across the majority of our end markets.  We recorded double-digit sales growth in nearly 60 percent of our markets, with sales declines limited to pet products, overwrap for bottled water, and confectionery and snack markets.  Performance in our medical device packaging operations has improved after last year's disruption from the start-up of new equipment and facilities.  Our European teams continue to deliver improved operating results as they reap the benefits of customer acceptance of new product offerings and implement a World Class Manufacturing program.  In this volatile global economic environment, we are aggressively responding to market conditions and will continue to work diligently to maintain our sales momentum and protect our operating profit."
 
Pressure Sensitive Materials
 
Net sales from the pressure sensitive materials business segment for the third quarter of 2008 were $157.8 million, a 1.5 percent decrease from net sales of $160.2 million in the third quarter of 2007.  Currency related sales growth totaled 3.0 percent.  Segment operating profit for the third quarter of 2008 was $9.0 million, or 5.7 percent of net sales, compared to the third quarter of 2007 when segment operating profit was $9.1 million, or 5.7 percent of net sales.  Currency benefits added $0.5 million to operating profit in the third quarter of 2008.
 
"Our pressure sensitive materials business is reflecting the impact of weak economic conditions in both North America and Europe," said Theisen. "In this environment, our teams have successfully maintained profit levels by focusing on cost management and adjusting selling prices to reflect raw material cost increases."
 
Other Costs (Income), Net
 
For the third quarter of 2008, other costs and income included $9.2 million of financial income compared to $7.2 million for the third quarter of 2007.
 
Capital Structure
 
Total debt to total capitalization was 32.5 percent at September 30, 2008, compared to 32.9 percent at December 31, 2007.  Total debt as of September 30, 2008 was $826.3 million, a decrease of $17.0 million from the balance of $843.3 million at December 31, 2007.  Cash flow from operations was $78.6 million in the third quarter of 2008.  Increased working capital levels primarily reflect higher raw material costs and selling prices.  We expect working capital levels to be reduced during the fourth quarter.
 
2008 Earnings Outlook
 
"The environment for input costs has changed dramatically over the past three months, but economic conditions continue to be challenging," said Theisen.  "While the majority of our products are sold into historically defensive markets for food and consumer products, even those markets can be impacted by changes in consumer buying patterns during difficult economic times.  While we are pleased with our current business backlog, we are also mindful of these risks and will carefully manage our resources during this period of uncertainty."
 
Management expects fourth quarter 2008 diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.40 to $0.44, reflecting the ongoing benefits of successful cost management and productivity improvement programs.  The capital expenditures forecast continues to be in the $125 million range for 2008.
