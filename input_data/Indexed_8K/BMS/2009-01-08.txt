FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
BEMIS UPDATES FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE GUIDANCE
 
- Bemis Company, Inc. (NYSE-BMS) announced today that, based upon preliminary estimates, it expects fourth quarter 2008 diluted earnings to be approximately 25 percent lower than its previous fourth quarter guidance of $0.40 to $0.44 per share.
NEENAH, WISCONSIN, January 8, 2009
 
"Approximately half of the shortfall relates to adverse currency effects on fourth quarter net income," said Henry Theisen, President and Chief Executive Officer of Bemis Company, Inc.  "The remainder is principally the result of sales volume decreases in certain product lines with exposure to non-food applications such as North American roll label products and protective display films."
 
Bemis will provide further details on results of operations when it announces its fourth quarter and total year 2008 results in a news release that will be available to the media and on the Bemis website on Tuesday, January 27, before the market opens.  Bemis will webcast an investor telephone conference regarding its completed 2008 financial results on January 27, 2009 at 10 a.m., Eastern Time.
