ITEM 2.02.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On April 28, 2009, Bemis Company, Inc. issued a press release containing its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2009, a copy of which is furnished as Exhibit 99 to this report.  Earnings guidance for the balance of 2009 for Bemis Company is included with this press release and will be available during the regular earnings release conference call scheduled for Tuesday, April 28, 2009, at 10:00 a.m. (EDT). Individuals may listen to the call on the Internet at www.bemis.com under "Investor Relations."

Instructions for obtaining the required, free, downloadable software are available in a pre-event system test on the site.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The press release furnished as an exhibit to this report contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including:
 
                 
Segment operating profit as adjusted
 
                 
Segment operating profit as adjusted as a percentage of net sales
 
                 
Diluted earnings per share as adjusted
 
Each of these measures excludes from the most directly comparable GAAP measures the impact of certain items.  Management believes these adjusted measures are useful to investors because they assist an investor's understanding of the impact of these items on the comparability of the Company's operations from year-to-year.  Excluding the impact of these items also enables investors to compare our underlying operational results and trends before other charges and income items that are considered by management to be non-recurring and do not relate to the Company's core operations.  Management uses these adjusted measures to monitor and evaluate operating performance and also for internal planning purposes.  These measures are subject to certain limitations because they do not reflect all charges or income items that were actually recognized by the Company in accordance with GAAP.  As a result, investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP.  In addition, these adjusted measures may not be calculated in the same manner as adjusted measures presented by other companies.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
BEMIS COMPANY REPORTS 2009 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
 
 Bemis Company, Inc. (NYSE-BMS) today reported quarterly diluted earnings of $0.36 per share for the first quarter ended March 31, 2009, compared with $0.41 per share for the same quarter of 2008.  Results for the current quarter were negatively impacted by severance charges associated with workforce reductions and the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007), (FAS 141(R)).  Excluding the effect of the items mentioned above, which are set forth in the attached schedule, "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Data", diluted earnings per share would have been $0.43 for the first quarter of 2009 compared to $0.41 per share for the first quarter of 2008.
NEENAH, WISCONSIN, April 28, 2009
Business Combinations
 
Net sales were $843.4 million for the first quarter of 2009, an 11.0 percent decrease from $947.3 million for the same period of 2008.  Currency effects reduced net sales by 8.3 percent compared to the first quarter of 2008.  The remaining 2.7 percent decrease in net sales reflects lower unit volume partially offset by a favorable price and mix impact compared to the first quarter of 2008.
 
"I am pleased to report strong first quarter performance results in such a challenging market environment," said Henry Theisen, Bemis Company's President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Our manufacturing agility along with our disciplined cost management strategies have served us well in this global recession.  We are controlling expenses, working capital, and manufacturing waste while maintaining our focus on customer service and quality.  Our business teams are facing an environment of broad economic and market uncertainty in 2009, and we are meeting each challenge with a strategy that we expect to deliver long-term value to Bemis Company."
 
New Accounting Pronouncements
 
FASB Staff Position No. EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03-6-1)
 
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for both of the years presented has been modified to reflect FASB Staff Position No. EITF 03-6-1, effective January 1, 2009.  This FASB Staff Position further interprets and clarifies the computation of shares outstanding for share-based awards.  The impact of this modification is a $0.01 per share decrease in basic and diluted earnings per share for each of the periods presented.  The 2008 earnings per share have been recast to reflect the impact of this new accounting guidance.
 
(revised 2007)
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 141
, Business Combinations (FAS 141(R))
 
First quarter 2009 diluted earnings per share included a $0.06 per share charge from the implementation of FAS 141(R).  Effective on a prospective basis for Bemis' fiscal years beginning January 1, 2009, this new accounting standard requires that acquisition costs associated with a possible business combination must be expensed when incurred.  These costs are principally accounting, legal, and other professional fees associated with Bemis' due diligence on a portion of the packaging business belonging to Rio Tinto plc.  These confidential efforts are ongoing and are consistent with Bemis' historical acquisition strategy of focusing on core competencies while retaining an investment grade profile.  No further details will be made available at this time.
 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 160, Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements (FAS 160), an amendment to ARB No. 51
 
The presentation of minority interest has been repositioned in accordance with FAS 160.  In the income statement, minority interest is presented on an after-tax basis, following a subtotal entitled "Net income before noncontrolling interests".  In the balance sheet, minority interest is now referred to as "Noncontrolling interest" and is now presented as a component of "Total stockholders' equity".
 
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
 
Flexible Packaging
 
Bemis' flexible packaging business segment, which represented about 85 percent of total Company net sales this quarter, reported net sales of $715.2 million in the first quarter.  This represents an 8.5 percent decrease compared to net sales of $781.6 million for the first quarter of 2008.  Currency effects reduced net sales by 8.7 percent.  Segment operating profit for the first quarter of 2009 was $91.4 million, or 12.8 percent of net sales.  Results for the quarter were negatively impacted by severance charges associated
 
with workforce reduction events intended to adjust workforce levels to better match market demands for certain product lines.  Excluding the impact of these severance costs, segment operating profit for the first quarter of 2009 would have been $92.5 million, or 12.9 percent of net sales.  (See attached schedule: "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Data".)  Segment operating profit for the first quarter of 2008 was $78.6 million, or 10.1 percent of net sales.  The net effect of currency translation and foreign exchange losses decreased operating profit in the first quarter of 2009 by $7.1 million compared to the same quarter of 2008.  Higher operating profit reflects the impact of both lower raw material costs in 2009 and the benefit of cost improvement programs.
 
Commenting on the flexible packaging segment results, Theisen said, "I am pleased to report that our flexible packaging business recorded record first quarter operating profit.  Our flexible packaging business segment is benefiting from a temporary raw material cost advantage which is expected to moderate during the second quarter as customer contract mechanisms adjust to reflect current raw material costs.  In addition, our aggressive efforts to manage production costs will continue to benefit Bemis going forward.  While we have experienced a slower business environment across many of our flexible packaging markets, we are pleased to report continued growth in the areas of our business where we have been investing, including packaging for processed meat and cheese, dairy and liquids, and medical devices.  Our South American operations are achieving healthy sales growth, partially offsetting the negative impact of local currency fluctuations.  Our European operations continue to improve.  Globally, our operations are prudently managing costs to accommodate inconsistent market demand.  Overall, this has been a strong quarter for our flexible packaging operations in the face of unusual market challenges."
 
Pressure Sensitive Materials
 
Net sales from the pressure sensitive materials business segment for the first quarter of 2009 were $128.2 million compared to $165.7 million in the first quarter of 2008.  Currency effects reduced net sales by 6.5 percent compared to the first quarter of 2008.  This segment reported an operating loss for the first quarter of 2009 of $1.9 million, compared to the first quarter of 2008 when segment operating profit was $11.9 million, or 7.2 percent of net sales.  Lower volume in each of the product lines in this business segment substantially reduced operating profit for the first quarter.  Results for the first quarter of 2009 were also negatively impacted by severance charges associated with workforce reduction events intended to adjust workforce levels to better match current market demands.  Excluding the impact of these severance costs, segment operating profit for the first quarter of 2009 would have been $0.7 million, or 0.5 percent of net sales.  (See attached schedule: "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Data".)  The net effect of currency translation and foreign exchange losses decreased operating profit in the first quarter of 2009 by $0.4 million compared to the same quarter of 2008.
 
"Consistent with our forecast at the beginning of this year, performance in our pressure sensitive materials business is reflecting the weakness in global economic conditions," said Theisen.  "Our customers in this segment operate in the advertising, automotive, housing, and consumer product markets, all of which have experienced a dramatic decline in product demand in this economic environment.  Our focus for 2009 is to manage costs aggressively to restore profitability as soon as possible and to meet production needs."
 
Other Costs (Income), Net
 
For the first quarter of 2009, other costs and income included $4.7 million of financial income, a decrease of $3.0 million compared to $7.7 million for the first quarter of 2008.  This decrease reflects lower interest income from cash balances invested outside of the United States in 2009.  Other costs and income also included $9.1 million of professional fees associated with a possible business combination.  These costs are expensed in accordance with FAS 141(R) referred to above.
 
Capital Structure
 
Total debt to total capitalization was 29.1 percent at March 31, 2009, compared to 31.5 percent at December 31, 2008.  Total stockholders' equity as of December 31, 2008, has been recast in accordance with FAS 160 as noted above.  Total debt as of March 31, 2009 was $617.4 million, a decrease of $69.2 million from the balance of $686.6 million at December 31, 2008.  Strong cash flow from operations of $148.3 million for the first quarter of 2009 benefited from our concerted efforts to reduce working capital by a total of $52.8 million.
 
Liquidity
 
As of March 31, 2009, Bemis had available from its banks a total of $625.0 million of revolving credit facilities.  These credit facilities are used principally as back-up for the Company's commercial paper program.  As of March 31, 2009, there was $282.8 million of debt outstanding supported by these credit facilities, leaving $342.2 million of available credit.  Of this amount, credit facilities accounting for $200.0 million in available credit expire on April 28, 2009 and will not be renewed.  Bemis continues to maintain the $425 million credit facility that expires in 2013.  Cash flows from operating activities are expected to continue to provide sufficient liquidity to meet future cash obligations.
 
Dividend Increase
 
During the first quarter, the board of directors approved a 2.3 percent increase in the quarterly dividend, from $0.22 per share to $0.225 per share.
 
2009 Earnings Outlook
 
Quarterly and annual guidance excludes the impact of FAS 141(R) and severance charges incurred and yet to be incurred in 2009.  Management expects second quarter 2009 diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.35 to $0.43 per share.  Guidance for the full year 2009 remains unchanged at $1.50 to $1.70 per share.  Management continues to expect capital expenditures to be in the $100 million to $110 million range for 2009.
 
Commenting on the outlook for the year, Theisen noted that the market conditions remain difficult to predict.  "While the results of the first quarter are encouraging, we continue to face challenging business conditions in both business segments.  The range of
 
our quarterly and full year guidance reflects the uncertainty that exists in the current market environment.  Our business teams continue to focus on maximizing performance results for 2009 and future periods," he said.
 
Presentation of Non-GAAP Information
 
Some of the information presented in this press release reflects adjustments to "As reported" results to exclude certain amounts related to the Company's workforce reductions and the implementation of FAS 141(R).  This adjusted information should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).  It is provided solely to assist in an investor's understanding of the impact of these items on the comparability of the Company's operations.  A reconciliation of the GAAP amounts to the Non-GAAP amounts is included with this press release.
 
Forward Looking Statements
 
Effective on a prospective basis for Bemis' fiscal years beginning 2009, Statement of Financial Accounting No. 141 (revised 2007), (FAS 141(R)), establishes new accounting principles governing accounting for business combinations, including changes in the accounting treatment of acquisition related costs.  Unless otherwise expressly stated, Bemis' quarterly and full-year guidance does not and will not include any estimated impact of such costs to be incurred in the future.  These costs are not estimable due to the uncertainty regarding the duration and extent of efforts necessary in the future.
Business Combinations
