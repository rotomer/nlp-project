FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
BEMIS COMPANY RAISES SECOND QUARTER GUIDANCE;
INCREASES TOTAL YEAR GUIDANCE
 
NEENAH, WISCONSIN, July 15, 2009
 Bemis Company, Inc. (NYSE-BMS) today announced that management expects its diluted earnings per share for the second quarter to be approximately $0.47.  These results include a $.03 per share charge related to the impact of expensing acquisition related costs in accordance with FAS 141(R).  Management's original guidance for the second quarter was $0.35 to $0.43 per share, and this guidance did not include any FAS 141(R) charges.  Results for the second quarter of 2009 benefited from lower raw material costs related to second quarter shipments, as well as the positive impact of cost management initiatives implemented during the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009.
 
Updated 2009 Earnings Outlook
Consistent with management's practice, guidance does not reflect the impact of charges incurred and yet to be incurred in 2009 related to severance, acquisition related costs, and interest expense or shares issued in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Alcan Packaging Food Americas business.  Management's guidance also excludes any operating results of the proposed acquisition.  Based upon the strong results for the first half of 2009 and management's consistent expectations for the remainder of the year, management has revised its guidance upward for the full year 2009 to a range of $1.68 to $1.75 per share.  This increases and narrows the range of guidance from management's previous guidance for 2009 of $1.50 to $1.70 per share.
 
Revised Schedule for Second Quarter Earnings Release and Conference Call
Bemis will provide further details on results of operations when it announces its second quarter results in a news release that will be available to the media and on the Bemis website on , before the market opens.

Presentation of Non-GAAP Information
Some of the information presented in this press release reflects adjustments to expected results to exclude certain amounts related to the Company's workforce reductions and the impact of expensed acquisition related costs.  This adjusted information should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).  It is provided solely to assist in an investor's understanding of the impact of these items on the comparability of the Company's operations.
 
Forward Looking Statements
Effective on a prospective basis for Bemis' fiscal years beginning January 1, 2009, Statement of Financial Accounting No. 141 (revised 2007), (FAS 141(R)), established new accounting principles governing accounting for business combinations, including changes in the accounting treatment of acquisition related costs.  Unless otherwise expressly stated, Bemis' quarterly and full-year guidance does not and will not include any actual or estimated impact of such costs incurred or to be incurred in the future.
