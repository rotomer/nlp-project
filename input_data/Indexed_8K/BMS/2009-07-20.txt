1.             BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Description of Business
 
Rio Tinto Alcan Packaging  Food Americas (the Group or Packaging  Food Americas), which is a component of Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. (RTA), is held for sale.  On October 23, 2007, Rio Tinto plc, a part of the Rio Tinto Group (Rio Tinto), acquired Alcan Inc. (Alcan) in a transaction referred to herein as the "Acquisition."  Prior to the Acquisition, Alcan had announced plans to sell all of its food, pharmaceutical and medical, beauty and personal care and tobacco packaging businesses (Alcan Packaging), which included 128 plants in 31 countries.  Upon the completion of the Acquisition in October 2007, Rio Tinto continued with Alcan's previously established plan to sell Alcan Packaging.
 
Rio Tinto Alcan Packaging  Food Americas includes only the food packaging businesses of Alcan Packaging operating in North America, South America and New Zealand, with 23 plants located in six countries.  The Group is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, United States of America (US).
 
References herein to the "Group," "Packaging  Food Americas," "we," "our," or "us" refer to Rio Tinto Alcan Packaging  Food Americas, unless the context specifically indicates otherwise.  When used throughout this document: (i) RTA refers to Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. and, where applicable, one or more of its subsidiaries, affiliates and joint ventures; (ii) Alcan refers to Alcan Inc. and, where applicable, one or more of its subsidiaries, affiliates and joint ventures; (iii) Rio Tinto refers to the Rio Tinto Group and, where applicable, one or more of its subsidiaries, affiliates and joint ventures; and (iv) Owner(s) refers to either Rio Tinto or Alcan or both, depending on the period(s) referenced by the context therein, and based upon the acquisition of Alcan by Rio Tinto on October 23, 2007.
 
Basis of Presentation
 
The Group's combined financial statements
are presented using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).  The Group has elected to use the US dollar as its reporting currency.  Management believes the assumptions underlying the combined financial statements, including the allocations described below, are reasonable.  However, the combined financial statements included herein may not necessarily reflect the Group's results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the future or what its results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had the Group been a stand-alone entity during the periods presented.
 
As these combined financial statements represent a portion of the businesses of the Owners which do not constitute a separate legal entity, the net assets of the Group have been presented as Owners' net investment in the Group.  The Owners' net investment in the Group is comprised primarily of the initial investment to establish the net assets of the Group (and any subsequent adjustments thereto), the accumulated net income (losses) of the Group, net transfers to or from the Owners, including those related to cash management functions performed by the Owners, non-cash changes in financing arrangements, corporate cost allocations and changes in certain income tax liabilities or assets.
 
Pre-Acquisition
 
The combined statements of operations, cash flows and comprehensive income (loss) and invested equity for the period from January 1, 2007 through October 23, 2007 and for the year ended December 31, 2006 (the "Predecessor" periods, as explained further below) have been derived from the accounting records of Alcan using the historical results of operations and historical bases of assets and liabilities of the businesses comprising the Group (including push down accounting, as described below, for pre-Acquisition acquisitions by Alcan), and were prepared in accordance with GAAP on a carve-out accounting basis.
 
Post-Acquisition
 
The combined balance sheets as at December 31, 2008 and 2007 and the combined statements of operations, cash flows and comprehensive income (loss) and invested equity for the year ended December 31, 2008 and for the period from October 24, 2007 through December 31, 2007 (the "Successor" periods, as explained further below) have been derived from the accounting records of RTA using the historical results of operations and historical bases of assets and liabilities of the businesses comprising the Group, and were prepared in accordance with GAAP on a carve-out accounting basis.  In addition, they have been adjusted for the effects of push down accounting from the Rio Tinto Acquisition of Alcan as described below and in Note 2  Acquisition of Alcan by Rio Tinto.
 
Predecessor and Successor Reporting
 
The effects of the Acquisition of Alcan by Rio Tinto, and the subsequent adjustments to the carve-out basis of accounting applied to the Group were recorded in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) Topic 5J, Push Down Basis of Accounting Required in Certain Limited Circumstances.  Accordingly, in the accompanying December 31, 2008 and 2007 combined balance sheets, the portion of the total consideration and related costs paid by Rio Tinto in connection with the Acquisition and attributable to the Group have been pushed down to Packaging 
RIO TINTO ALCAN PACKAGING  FOOD AMERICAS
NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands of US$, except per share amounts and unless stated otherwise)
Food Americas and have been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations.
 
Due to the impact of push down accounting, the Group's combined financial statements and certain note presentations for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 are presented in two distinct periods to indicate the application of two different bases of accounting between the periods presented: (1) the period up to and including the Acquisition date (January 1, 2007 through October 23, 2007, identified as "Predecessor") and (2) the period after that date (October 24, 2007 through December 31, 2007, identified as "Successor").  All periods presented including and prior to the year ended December 31, 2006 are also identified as "Predecessor."  Combined financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2008 are identified as "Successor".  The Group's combined financial statements and certain notes include a black line division which indicates that the Predecessor and Successor reporting entities shown are not comparable.
 
Allocations from Owners
 
In addition to the carve-out of businesses and entities comprising the operations and the net assets of the Group, the Group's combined financial statements also include allocations of certain Owners' expenses, including the items described below.
 
The expenses allocated are not necessarily indicative of the expenses that would have been incurred had the Group performed these functions as a stand-alone entity, nor are they indicative of expenses that will be charged or incurred in the future.  It is not practicable to estimate the amount of expenses the Group would have incurred for the periods presented had it not been an affiliated entity of the Owners in each of those periods.
 
General Corporate Expenses
 
The Owners have allocated certain of their general corporate expenses to the Group based on average capital employed.  Capital employed represents total Packaging  Food Americas assets, less: (a) current and non-current trade payables and other; (b) provisions; (c) deferred income tax assets; and (d) short-term and long-term loans receivable from related parties.  The general corporate expense allocations are included in Selling and administrative expenses  related parties in the Group's combined statements of operations.  These allocations are primarily for finance, human resources, legal, corporate and external affairs and the executive office of RTA and are mainly comprised of salaries, including variable compensation and normal current service cost for pensions, and other direct costs of the various functions.
 
The following table shows the general corporate expense allocations from the Owners and the Group's total head office costs, including the amounts allocated, for each of the periods presented in the accompanying combined statements of operations:
 
 
The general corporate expense allocation for the period from January 1, 2007 through October 23, 2007 includes higher share-based compensation costs triggered by Alcoa Inc.'s unsolicited offer to acquire Alcan and the subsequent Rio Tinto Acquisition, and payments made to certain Alcan executives pursuant to change of control agreements triggered by the Acquisition.
 
Pensions and Postretirement Benefits
 
Certain businesses included in the Group have pension obligations mostly comprised of funded defined benefit pension plans in the US, Canada and Mexico.  Certain businesses included in the Group also have unfunded other postretirement benefit obligations, mostly comprised of healthcare benefits for retired employees in the US.  The related assets, liabilities and costs of these pension and other postretirement benefit plans are included in the Group's combined financial statements.
 
For benefit plans of divisions of the Owners included in the Group for which the plans are managed by the Owners, the pension costs are accounted for by including their share of the service cost and allocating the other components of the pension costs based on their share of the projected benefit obligation in the Group's combined statements of operations.  For these plans, none of the plan assets or projected benefit obligations are included in the Group's combined balance sheets.

NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands of US$, except per share amounts and unless stated otherwise)
Income Taxes
 
Income taxes are calculated as if all of the Group's operations had been separate tax paying legal entities, each filing a separate tax return in its local tax jurisdiction.  Certain income tax amounts currently payable or receivable by the Group are included in Owners' net investment, because the net liability (receivable) for the taxes due (refundable) is recorded in the financial statements of the Owners' non-Group entity that files the consolidated tax return.  As a result of the aforementioned structure, substantially all of the Group's income tax liabilities (refunds) are also paid (collected) by the various Owners' non-Group entities.  The net changes in income tax amounts currently payable or receivable are included in net cash transfers (to) from Owners in the accompanying combined financial statements.
 
Cash Management
 
Cash and cash equivalents in the combined balance sheets are comprised of the cash and cash equivalents of the Group's businesses.  None of the Owners' cash and cash equivalents has been allocated to the Group in the combined financial statements.
 
Historically, the Group's businesses in South America and New Zealand have performed their own cash management functions, while the Owners have performed cash management functions on behalf of the Group's businesses in North America.  Cash deposits from the businesses in North America are transferred to the Owners on a regular basis.  Cash transfers to and from the Owners are included in the Owners' net investment.
 
Interest Expense
 
The Owners incur third party debt at the Owner level, and provide financing to the Group in the form of short-term borrowings and long-term debt.  This financing is included within the amounts due to related parties in the Group's combined balance sheets and is substantially all interest-bearing at variable rates, as described in Note 15  Short-Term Borrowings and Debt and Note 21  Related Party Transactions.  Interest on this related party financing is included in Interest expense  related parties in the combined statements of operations.  The Owners do not allocate any additional interest expense to the Group.
 
Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation
 
Stock-option and other share-based compensation expense in the combined statements of operations includes the Owners' expenses related to the fair value of awards held by certain employees of the Packaging  Food Americas businesses during the periods presented, as well as an allocation, calculated based on employment costs for both stock options and other share-based compensation, for the Owners' corporate office employees.
 
Earnings Per Share
 
The Group is not a separate legal entity with common shares outstanding.  Therefore, earnings per share information is not presented in the accompanying combined financial statements.
 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions.  These may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.  They may also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Business Combinations
 
All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method.  Under the purchase method, assets and liabilities of the acquired entity are recorded at fair value.  The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.
 
As a result of the Acquisition of Alcan by Rio Tinto, all of Alcan's assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at fair value with the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed recorded as goodwill.  As Alcan Packaging was designated as held for sale, Rio Tinto classified Alcan Packaging (which includes the Group) as assets held for sale, which were recorded at fair value less estimated cost to sell.   For purposes of these combined carve-out financial statements, the fair value less estimated cost to sell that was assigned to the Group has been deemed to be the cost of the net assets of the Group.  The cost of the net assets of the Group has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as at the date of acquisition, with the excess of the deemed cost recognized as goodwill.  See Note 2  Acquisition of Alcan by Rio Tinto.
 
Principles of Combination and Other Investments
 
The combined financial statements include the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of the Group.  Investments in entities over which the Group has significant influence are accounted for using the equity method.  Under the equity method, the
RIO TINTO ALCAN PACKAGING  FOOD AMERICAS
NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands of US$, except per share amounts and unless stated otherwise)
Group's investment is increased or decreased by the Group's share of the undistributed net income or loss and deferred translation adjustments since acquisition.  Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.  Other investments are accounted for using the cost method.  Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as income.
 
All intra-Group balances and transactions, including profits in inventories, between and among the Group's businesses are eliminated in the combined financial statements.  Balances and transactions between the Group and the Owners have been identified as related party balances and transactions.
 
Foreign Currency
 
The reporting currency of the Group is the US dollar.  The functional currency of foreign operations is generally the local currency.  The assets and liabilities of those foreign operations are translated into US dollars at the year-end exchange rates.  Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the year.  Differences arising from exchange rate changes are included in the Deferred translation adjustments (DTA) component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  If there is a reduction in the Group's ownership in a foreign operation, the relevant portion of DTA is recognized in Other expenses (income)  net.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
Revenue from product sales, net of trade discounts, allowances and volume-based incentives, is recognized once delivery has occurred provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.  Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer.  Revenue from services is recognized as services are rendered.
 
Shipping and Handling Costs
 
Amounts charged to customers related to shipping and handling are included in Sales and operating revenues, and related shipping and handling costs are recorded in Cost of sales and operating expenses.
 
Derivative Instruments
 
The Group enters into derivative contracts to hedge certain future, identifiable foreign currency and energy related risks.  All such contracts are reported at fair value in the combined balance sheets and changes in fair value are included in Other expenses (income)  net.  Alcan was the counterparty to all of the Group's derivative contracts until the fourth quarter of 2007. 
During the fourth quarter of 2007, all of the counterparty positions held by Alcan were transferred at fair value to Financire Euro Emballages Pechiney (FEEP, an entity within Alcan Packaging but excluded from the Group) and immediately cash-settled by FEEP with Alcan.  As a result of the aforementioned transfer, FEEP is the counterparty to all of the Group's derivative instruments as at December 31, 2008 and 2007.
 
In circumstances where the Group's physical purchase or sale contracts for a commodity contain derivative characteristics, these contracts, excluding those considered to be derivatives held for trading purposes, are generally not recorded at fair value as they involve quantities that are expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business over a reasonable period of time.
 
Inventories
 
Inventories are stated at cost (determined primarily using the average cost method) or net realizable value, whichever is lower.  Cost includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs.
 
Sale of Receivables
 
When the Group sells certain receivables to the Owners, it retains servicing rights and provides limited recourse, which constitutes retained interests in the sold receivables.  No servicing asset or liability is recognized in the combined financial statements as the fees received by the Group reflect the fair value of the cost of servicing these receivables.  The related purchase discount is included in Other expenses (income)  net  related parties.
 
Property, Plant and Equipment
 
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost.  Additions, improvements and major renewals are capitalized; maintenance and repair costs are expensed.  Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method using rates based on the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.  The principal rates range from 2% to 10% for buildings and structures, and from 6% to 10% for fabricating assets.  Gains or losses from the sale of property, plant and equipment are included in Other expenses (income)  net.
RIO TINTO ALCAN PACKAGING  FOOD AMERICAS
NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands of US$, except per share amounts and unless stated otherwise)
Intangible Assets
 
The Group's intangible assets are comprised primarily of customer contracts and relationships; patented and non-patented technology; and trademarks and tradenames, all of which have finite lives.  Intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their useful lives.
 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
 
The Group reviews its long-lived assets and amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset.  Any impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.  Such evaluations for impairment are significantly affected by estimates of future prices for the Group's products, capital needs, economic trends in the market and other factors.
 
Determinations of market values (quotes, bids, proposals, etc.) are used whenever available to estimate fair value.  When market values are unavailable, the fair value of the long-lived asset is generally based on estimates of future discounted net cash flows.  Assets to be disposed of by sale are reflected at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less estimated cost to sell and are not depreciated while classified as held for sale.
 
Goodwill
 
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis at the reporting unit level (which corresponds to the Group's operating segment level) and is also tested for impairment when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a segment below its carrying value.  
Fair value is based on estimates of discounted future net cash flows, unless a market value indicator from a third party is available.
 
Restructuring Charges
 
The Group records restructuring charges in accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which requires a company to recognize the liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities when the liabilities are incurred.  Examples of costs covered by SFAS No. 146 include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with restructuring activities, discontinued operations, facility closings or other exit or disposal activities.
 
The Group recognizes liabilities that primarily include one-time termination benefits, or severance, and contract termination costs, primarily related to equipment and facility lease obligations.  These amounts are based on the remaining amounts due under various contractual agreements, and are periodically adjusted for any anticipated or unanticipated events or changes in circumstances that would reduce or increase these obligations. The settlement of these liabilities could differ materially from recorded amounts.
 
Legal Claims
 
Accruals for legal claims are made when it is probable that liabilities will be incurred and where such liabilities can be reasonably estimated.
 
Environmental Costs and Liabilities
 
Environmental costs are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate, and the liability recorded generally on an undiscounted basis.  Environmental expenditures of a capital nature that extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety of an asset or that mitigate or prevent environmental contamination that has yet to occur are included in Property, plant and equipment and are depreciated generally over the remaining useful life of the underlying asset.  Expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations, and which do not contribute to future revenues, are expensed when probable and estimable and are normally included in Cost of sales and operating expenses except for large, unusual amounts, which are included in Other expenses (income)  net.  Recoveries relating to environmental liabilities are recorded when received or when changes in circumstances warrant revisions to estimates.
 
Pensions and Postretirement Benefits
 
Certain entities within the Group manage their defined benefit pension plans separately from those of the Owners.  The Group's defined benefit pension plans are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions and, beginning December 31, 2006, SFAS No. 158,
Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment to Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). 
Other postretirement benefits are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions and, beginning December 31, 2006, SFAS No. 158.  Pension and postretirement
benefit obligations are actuarially calculated using management's best estimates and based on expected service period, salary increases and retirement ages of employees.  Pension and postretirement benefit expense includes the actuarially computed cost of benefits earned during the current service period, the interest cost on accrued obligations, the
RIO TINTO ALCAN PACKAGING  FOOD AMERICAS
NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands of US$, except per share amounts and unless stated otherwise)
expected return on plan assets based on fair market value and the straight-line amortization of net actuarial gains and losses and adjustments due to plan amendments.  All net actuarial gains and losses are amortized over the expected average remaining service life of the employees.
 
Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation
 
Immediately prior to the Acquisition of Alcan by Rio Tinto in October 2007, all share-based compensation awards were settled.  Prior to their settlement, Alcan accounted for stock options granted to certain of its employees under the Alcan share option plan using the fair value provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment.  Under the fair value method, stock option expense is recognized in the statement of operations over the requisite service period.  Compensation expense related to the Group's employees is recognized immediately for options that vest within the reporting period.  Other cash-settled stock-based compensation arrangements were considered liability-classified awards, and were measured at fair value on the grant date and remeasured at the end of each reporting period until the award was settled.  Compensation expense for liability-classified awards is adjusted each reporting period for changes in fair value prorated for the portion of the vesting period rendered.  Once vested, compensation expense or income is immediately recognized for any change in fair value.  The majority of the Group's stock-based compensation expense is included in Selling and administrative expenses.
 
Research and Development
 
The Group incurs costs in connection with research and development programs that are expected to contribute to future earnings, and charges such costs against income as incurred.  These costs include certain salaries, wages and related employment, facilities and operating expenses.
 
Income Taxes
 
This approach also requires the recognition of deferred tax assets for operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards.
The Group uses the asset and liability approach for accounting for income taxes (also refer to Allocations from Owners  Income Taxes above).  Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. 
 
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates and laws is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be recovered or settled.  The Group records a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is not more likely than not that the assets will be realized.  The Group uses judgment in assessing the potential for future recoverability, while at the same time considering past experience.  The Group's conclusion of whether it is more likely than not that deferred assets will be realized includes making assessments of expectations of future taxable income.  All available evidence is considered in determining the amount of a valuation allowance.
 
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions worldwide.  Certain businesses comprising the Group are separate legal entities, while others may represent only a portion of an existing legal entity.  Certain of the Group's businesses may be included in consolidated tax returns with the Owners, in some cases under the terms of non-compensatory tax sharing agreements.  In certain circumstances, the Group may be jointly and severally liable with other members of the entity filing the consolidated return for additional taxes that may be assessed.  For purposes of these combined financial statements, i
ncome taxes are calculated as if all of the Group's operations had been separate tax-paying legal entities, each filing a separate tax return in its local tax jurisdiction.  As a result of using the separate return method, the resulting income tax attributes reflected in these combined financial statements may not reflect the historical or going forward position of income tax balances, especially those related to tax loss carryforwards.  The application of a tax allocation method requires significant judgment and making certain assumptions, mainly related to opening balances, applicable income tax rates, valuation allowances and other considerations.  Certain income tax amounts currently payable or receivable by the Group are included in Owners' net investment, because the net liability (receivable) for the taxes due (refundable) and the actual payment or receipt of income taxes (refunds) are recorded in the financial statements of the Owners' non-Group entity that files the consolidated tax return.  Provisions for uncertain tax positions are included in the Group's combined balance sheets within liabilities or Owners' net investment.
 
On January 1, 2007, the Group adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.  Under FIN 48, the Group may recognize the tax benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of
For periods prior to January 1, 2007, in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, the Group established tax reserves and interest thereon when the Group expected that certain of these positions would be challenged and that the Group might not succeed in defending its positions, despite the Group's belief that the tax return positions were fully supportable.

(in thousands of US$, except per share amounts and unless stated otherwise)
The Group believes that the accruals for tax liabilities reflect the probable outcome of all material tax contingencies.
being realized upon settlement. 
 
Investment tax credits are accounted for as a reduction in income tax expense.  Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as part of the income tax provision.
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
Cash and cash equivalents includes investments that are highly liquid and have original maturities of three months or less when purchased.  The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
 
The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects management's best estimate of probable losses inherent in the trade receivables balance.  Management determines the allowance based on known doubtful accounts, historical experience and other currently available evidence.

In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active (FSP FAS 157-3).  The FSP clarifies the application of Statement of FASB 157 in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active.  FSP FAS 157-3 was effective upon issuance, and had no impact on our combined financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
 
SFAS No. 159  The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
 
SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,
including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 became effective for adoption by all companies on January 1, 2008.  The adoption of this statement is optional.  The standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities.  The Group has elected not to apply the fair value option.
 
SFAS No. 157  Fair Value Measurements
 
On January 1, 2008, the Group prospectively adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and to expand their disclosures.  The new standard includes a definition of fair value as well as a framework for measuring fair value.  The adoption of this standard did not materially impact the Group's financial statements.
 
FIN 48  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
 
On January 1, 2007, the Group adopted the provisions of FIN 48.  Under FIN 48, the Group may recognize the tax benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.  FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and expanded income tax disclosures. 
On January 1, 2007, the Group recorded a net increase of $399 to its liability for unrecognized tax benefits, resulting in an equivalent decrease to the January 1, 2007 balance of Owners' net investment.  See Note 7  Income Taxes.
 
SFAS No. 156  Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets
 
On January 1, 2007, the Group adopted SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets.  This statement, which is an amendment to SFAS No. 140, requires that all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities be initially measured at fair value, if practicable, and permits, but does not require, the subsequent measurement of separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities at fair value.  If an entity uses derivative instruments to mitigate the risks inherent in servicing assets and servicing liabilities, it can simplify its accounting since SFAS No. 156 permits income statement recognition of the potential offsetting changes in fair value of those servicing assets and servicing liabilities and derivative instruments in the same accounting period.  SFAS No. 156 is effective for all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity's fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006.  The adoption of this standard did not impact the Group's financial statements.
 
SFAS No. 158  Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans
 
SFAS No. 158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment to FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R).  The standard
Effective December 31, 2006, the Group adopted the provisions of
RIO TINTO ALCAN PACKAGING  FOOD AMERICAS
NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands of US$, except per share amounts and unless stated otherwise)
requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan (other than a multiemployer plan) as an asset or liability in its balance sheet with an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive income and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur. SFAS No. 158 also expands the required annual disclosures.  At December 31, 2006, the Group recognized a liability of $10,504 for the underfunded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans, with a corresponding charge of $5,260 (net of tax) against accumulated other comprehensive income in connection with the adoption of this standard.
 
SAB 108  Guidance for Quantifying Financial Statement Misstatements
 
Effective December 31, 2006, the Group adopted the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (SAB 108), Guidance for Quantifying Financial Statement Misstatements.  In SAB 108, the staff of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects of the error on each of the Group's financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures.  This model is commonly referred to as a "dual approach" because it essentially requires quantification of errors under both the "iron-curtain" and the "roll-over" methods.
 
The iron curtain method focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period-end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year errors on the statement of operations in the period of correction.  The roll-over method focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the statement of operations, including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements, but can lead to the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet.  The adoption of this bulletin did not impact the Group's financial statements.
 
SFAS No. 123(R)  Share-Based Payment
 
On January 1, 2006, the Group adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, which is a revision to SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.  SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values.  The fair value of options granted after January 1, 2006 is determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model, whereas the fair value of options granted prior to that date was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model.  The Group had previously adopted the fair-value based method of accounting for stock options under SFAS No. 123 using the retroactive restatement method described in SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure, effective January 1, 2004.  The effect of applying the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) was a decrease in pre-tax compensation expense of $182 in the year ended December 31, 2006.
 
On January 1, 2006, the Group recorded an after-tax charge of $162, using the modified prospective application method, in Cumulative effect of accounting change, to record all outstanding liability awards, previously measured at their intrinsic value, at their fair value.  See Note 20  Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation.
 
SFAS No. 151
 Inventory Costs
 
On January 1, 2006, the Group adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, on a prospective basis.  This statement amends the guidance in Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4, "Inventory Pricing", to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage).  ARB No. 43 previously stated that these expenses may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges.  SFAS No. 151 requires that those items be recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of "so abnormal".
 
In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities.  The adoption of this standard did not impact the Group's financial statements.
 
SFAS No. 154
 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections
 
On January 1, 2006, the Group adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3.  This statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle.  The statement requires retrospective application to prior periods' financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle versus including the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle in net income.  SFAS No. 154 carries forward many provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 20 without change, including the provisions related to the reporting of a change in accounting estimate, a change in the reporting entity, and the correction of an error.  The adoption of this standard did not impact the Group's financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
 
SFAS No. 166  Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets
 
In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 166  Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets (SFAS No. 166).  SFAS No. 166 is a revision to SFAS No. 140  Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, and will require additional disclosure about the transfers of financial assets, including securitization transactions, and additional disclosure in cases where entities have continuing exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets.  The statement eliminates the concept of "qualifying special-purpose entity" and changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets.  SFAS No. 166 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009.  Earlier application is prohibited and must be applied to transfers occurring on or after the effective date.  We have not determined the impact, if any, SFAS No. 166 will have on our financial statements.
 
SFAS No. 165  Subsequent Events
 
In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165  Subsequent Events (SFAS No. 165) which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued.  It also requires the disclosure of the date through which subsequent events are evaluated and the basis for that date, that is, whether that date represents the date the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued.  The effective date for SFAS No. 165 is for interim or annual periods ending on or after June 15, 2009.  We are currently evaluating the effects that the adoption of SFAS No. 165 may have on our financial statements.
 
SFAS No. 161  Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
 
In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161  Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133.  The standard enhances the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities.  The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after November 15, 2008, with early adoption encouraged.  The Group is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its financial statements.
 
SFAS No. 141(R)  Business Combinations
 
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised), Business Combinations.  This standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value at the acquisition date, with limited exceptions.  The statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008.  Early adoption is not permitted.
 
We have determined that all other recently issued accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on our combined financial position, results of operations and cash flows, or do not apply to our operations.
 
2.             ACQUISITION OF ALCAN BY RIO TINTO
 
On October 23, 2007, Alcan was acquired by Rio Tinto.  As a result of the Acquisition, the portion of the total consideration and transaction costs paid by Rio Tinto in connection with the Acquisition and attributable to the Group (the "Packaging  Food Americas consideration") was determined by Rio Tinto to be $839,824.
 
The Packaging  Food Americas consideration was determined using Rio Tinto's best estimate of the expected proceeds to be realized on the sale of Alcan Packaging, based on the net cash flows it was expected to generate in the future, discounted at a rate of 9 percent.  A portion of these expected proceeds was attributed to the Group on the basis of the fair value of its net assets relative to the fair value of Alcan Packaging's net assets.
 
The Packaging  Food Americas consideration has been pushed down and allocated to the Group's assets acquired and liabilities assumed, in accordance with SFAS No. 141, based on our estimates of fair value using methodologies and assumptions that we and Rio Tinto believe are reasonable.  To estimate fair values, a number of factors were considered, including the application of multiples to discounted cash flow estimates.  There is considerable management judgment with respect to cash flow estimates and appropriate multiples used in determining fair value.
 
The following table shows the allocation of the Packaging  Food Americas consideration to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed of the Group at the date of the Acquisition.
 
RIO TINTO ALCAN PACKAGING  FOOD AMERICAS
NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands of US$, except per share amounts and unless stated otherwise)
 
 
The allocation shown above included significant fair value adjustments to the previously recorded historical amounts of certain of the Groups assets and liabilities: primarily Property, plant and equipment; Intangible assets; Inventories; Short-Term Borrowings and Debt, along with adjustments to the deferred income taxes associated with these assets and liabilities.  Intangible assets include customer contracts and relationships; patented and non-patented technology; and trademarks and tradenames.  Fair value adjustments to certain of the Group's short-term borrowings and debt instruments are being amortized on the straight-line method over the life of the related borrowings in Interest expense  third and related parties.  These push down adjustments did not impact the Group's cash flows and were not deductible for income tax purposes.
 
As a result of the Acquisition, all of the Group's goodwill as at October 24, 2007 arises from the allocation of the Packaging  Food Americas consideration under push down accounting.
 
Goodwill is attributable to several factors, including (i) the fair value of the Group's workforce; (ii) the value of potential expansion into new markets and geographies, which would lead to the future development of customer relationships not captured in identified intangible asset value; (iii) technology not yet developed that will increase efficiency, which is not captured in identified intangible value; and (iv) the perpetuity value associated with the Group operating indefinitely.
 
3.             DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
 
During the year ended December 31, 2005, Group management decided to discontinue the operations of its North American Food Packaging Plastic Bottle businesses, which were then classified as held for sale as at December 31, 2005 and included in discontinued operations.  During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Group sold the net assets of these businesses for proceeds of $181,922, resulting in a loss on disposal of $(2,815).  The table below shows selected financial information for the businesses included in discontinued operations in the Group's combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006.  Income from operations includes the write-off of $80,511 of goodwill, which is non-deductible for income tax purposes.  As a result, and also due to (i) taxable gains resulting from the disposal of certain patented technology; and (ii) income tax expense on taxable earnings in the US, the loss from discontinued operations includes a substantial amount of income tax expense.

4.             RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS
 
Descriptions of programs
 
Year ended December 31, 2008
 
The Group approved and initiated headcount reduction restructuring plans in certain plants in its Food and Specialty North America operating segment as part of continuing efforts to manage ongoing costs and margins, and incurred severance costs of $758.  During the year ending December 31, 2009, the Group expects to incur additional severance costs of approximately $466 in connection with the completion of this program.
 
The Group approved and initiated headcount reduction restructuring plans in certain plants in its Food South America operating segment as part of continuing efforts to manage ongoing costs and margins, and incurred severance costs of $586.  During the year ending December 31, 2009, the Group expects to incur additional severance costs of approximately $263 in connection with the completion of this program.
 
The Group initiated a restructuring plan in its Labels America operating segment (approved during the year ended     December 31, 2007) to streamline operations, in order to better match capacity with demand while reducing costs.  The plan called for the closure of one facility and the transfer of certain equipment to another facility, and resulted in severance costs of $420 and other exit-related costs of $2,811, comprised of asset removal, transport and installation costs, along with environmental and facility post-closure costs.  The plan was substantially completed during 2008 and no significant additional costs are expected.
 
Period from October 24, 2007 through December 31, 2007
 
There were no restructuring costs incurred during this period.
 
Period from January 1, 2007 through October 23, 2007
 
The Group incurred additional severance costs of $455, asset impairment charges of $630 and other exit-related costs of $224 in its Food and Specialty North America operating segment to complete restructuring plans that had been initiated during the year ended December 31, 2006.  No further costs are expected in connection with these plans.
 
Year ended December 31, 2006
 
The Group incurred restructuring charges in its Food and Specialty North America operating segment relating to two projects initiated and approved during the year ended December 31, 2005.  One project involved efforts to focus certain plants on their main technologies, and resulted in other exit-related costs of $1,857.  The other project involved the consolidation of certain operations, and resulted in severance costs of $94, asset impairment charges of $935 and other exit-related costs of $1,275.
 
The Group incurred severance costs of $1,239 and other exit-related costs of $1,365 in connection with the closure of a plant in its Labels America operating segment. 
No further costs are expected in connection with this plant closure.

As at December 31, 2008, the Group had tax benefit carryovers of $4,901 relating to operating losses, which expire at various dates between 2010 and 2018.
 
The valuation allowance amounts of $3,671 and $1,396 as at December 31 2008 and 2007, respectively, relate primarily to deferred tax assets of entities for which realization is not more likely than not.  During the year ended December 31, 2008, none of the valuation allowance was reversed.  During the periods from October 24, 2007 through December 31, 2007 and January 1, 2007 through October 23, 2007, valuation allowances of $429 and $516, respectively, were reversed and were
RIO TINTO ALCAN PACKAGING  FOOD AMERICAS
NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands of US$, except per share amounts and unless stated otherwise)
 
allocated to reduce goodwill.  If the valuation allowance is subsequently reversed, none would be allocated to reduce goodwill upon adoption of SFAS No. 141(R),effective January 1, 2009.
 
FIN 48
 
As disclosed in Note 1  Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the Group adopted the provisions of FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007.  The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $6,823 and $6,791, respectively, of which $6,823 and $152, respectively, would impact the Group's effective tax rate, if recognized.  Certain movements in unrecorded tax benefits were allocated to adjust goodwill as they related to years prior to the Acquisition (See Note 12  Goodwill).
 
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
 
 
The Group recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of the income tax provision.  During the year ended December 31, 2008 and during the periods from October 24, 2007 through December 31, 2007 and January 1, 2007 through October 23, 2007, the Group recorded interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of $590, $149 and $462, respectively.  The total accrued net liability for interest and penalties as at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $2,329 and 2,151, respectively.
 
Certain unrecorded tax benefit liabilities, including related interest accruals, are included in Owners' net investment, in accordance with carve-out accounting guidelines as discussed in Note 1  Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
 
As a multi-jurisdiction taxpayer, the Group is under continual audit by various taxing authorities on several open tax years. Therefore, it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns could significantly increase or decrease in the next 12 months. However, based on the status of these examinations and the uncertainty surrounding the outcomes of audits and negotiations, it is not possible at this time to estimate the impact of any such changes, if any.
 
The Group conducts business internationally and, as a result, the entities within which the Group operates file income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions.  In the normal course of business, the Group is subject to examination by taxing authorities in these jurisdictions, including the US, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and New Zealand.  Foreign jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging from two to five years.  In general, the Group has tax years still open to examination in various jurisdictions ranging from the year 2003 and onward.
 
8.             TRADE RECEIVABLES
 
 
Sale of receivables
 
Through October 2006, the Group's businesses in North America had an agreement to sell certain third party trade receivables to a third party. The program was terminated in November 2006 and was incorporated into a global program managed by the
 
RIO TINTO ALCAN PACKAGING  FOOD AMERICAS
NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands of US$, except per share amounts and unless stated otherwise)
 
Owners.  Under this program, the Group sold and continues to sell to the Owners an undivided interest in certain third party trade receivables, without recourse, under an Eligible Operating Subsidiary Receivables Purchase Agreement.  The third party receivables are exchanged for receivables from the Owners, which are included in Trade receivables  related parties (see Note 21  Related Party Transactions).  The trade receivables from related parties balances as at December 31, 2008 and 2007 shown in the table above include approximately $46,114 and $37,570, respectively, related to receivables sold under this program, with approximately $7,997 and $5,940, respectively, held in reserve by the Owners.
 
The Owners charge the Group a purchase discount, which the Group charges back to the Owners as the Group acts as a service agent and administers the collection of the receivables sold.  The purchase discount and the offsetting servicing fee are included in Other expenses (income)  net  related parties.
 
Allowance for doubtful accounts
 
The allowance for doubtful accounts represents management's best estimate of probable losses inherent in the third party trade receivables balance.  Management determines the allowance based on known uncollectible accounts, historical experience and other currently available evidence.  Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows:

Impairments
 
During the period from January 1, 2007 through October 23, 2007, the Group recorded asset impairment charges of $6,172 in its
Labels America operating segment, related to machinery and equipment that was taken out of service and written down to its net realizable value.  These impairment charges were not related to a restructuring plan, and were therefore included in the total asset impairment charges of $6,271 included in Other expenses (income)  net  third parties in the Group's combined statement of operations.
 
11.          INTANGIBLE ASSETS
 
The components of the Group's intangible assets, all of which have finite lives, are shown in the table below.
 
 
Amortization expense related to intangible assets was as follows:
 
 
Future estimated amortization expense for each of the five succeeding fiscal years is expected to be approximately $18,700.  Actual amounts may differ from these estimates due to such factors as customer turnover, impairments, additional intangible asset acquisitions and other events.

12.          GOODWILL
 
The Group had historical goodwill arising from its acquisitions in periods prior to the Acquisition of Alcan by Rio Tinto.
 
As a result of the Acquisition of Alcan by Rio Tinto, the Group's combined financial statements for periods subsequent to October 23, 2007 are presented on a new basis of accounting.  All of the Group's goodwill as at October 24, 2007 arises from the allocation of the Packaging  Food Americas consideration under push down accounting, as discussed below and in Note 2  Acquisition of Alcan by Rio Tinto.
 
The fair value of the Group at the time of the Acquisition of Alcan was determined using Rio Tinto's best estimate of the expected proceeds to be realized on the sale of Alcan Packaging, based on the net cash flows it was expected to generate in the future, discounted at a rate of 9 percent.  A portion of these expected proceeds was then attributed to the Group on the basis of the fair value of its net assets relative to the fair value of Alcan Packaging's net assets.  This fair value was then allocated to the Group's assets acquired, liabilities assumed and goodwill.
 
Impairments
 
In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill for potential impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each year or when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an operating segment below its carrying value.  We test goodwill for impairment using a fair value approach at the reporting unit level.  We use our operating segments as our reporting units.
 
Our estimate of fair value of each reporting unit is based on discounted cash flows (the income approach).  Under the income approach, the fair value of each reporting unit was based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimated demand in each market and the discount rate. The discount rate is commensurate with the risk inherent in the projected cash flows and reflects the rate of return required by an investor in the current economic conditions.  The reasonableness of the fair value conclusions was assessed by comparing the implied earnings before interest and tax multiples against industry observable market multiples.
 
As a result of our impairment testing, for the year ended December 31, 2008, the Group recorded a total impairment charge to goodwill of $184,638 due to: (i) the global economic downturn; (ii) the adverse trading performance of the Group's companies in their respective markets; and (iii) adverse changes in the capital markets, which made it difficult to finance the acquisitions of companies in general.  Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2006, the Group recorded an impairment of goodwill totaling $25,983 due to the adverse trading performance of the Group's Alcan Packaging Danaflex operating segment.
 
Activity
 
Changes in the Group's goodwill by operating segment and including intersegment and other (see Note 23  Information by Operating Segment) are as follows:

Fair values
 
In connection with the Acquisition, all of the Group's short-term borrowings and debt instruments were recorded at their fair values as at October 23, 2007, which resulted in adjustments to the principal amounts of certain of the Group's short-term borrowings and debt instruments.  The net fair value adjustment was a decrease of $(2,663), and is being amortized on a straight-line basis (which approximates the "effective interest amortization" method) over the life of the related borrowings into Interest expense  third and related parties.  During the year ended December 31, 2008 and the period from October 24, 2007 through December 31, 2007, $2,339 and $476, respectively, of the net fair value adjustment was amortized as additional interest expense.  As at December 31, 2008, the remaining net unamortized fair value adjustment was $152 (a net increase to fair value) and will be amortized to adjust interest expense in future periods.
 
Short-term borrowings
 
All of the Group's short-term borrowings consist of variable and fixed rate credit facilities and cash pooling agreements with various businesses and subsidiaries of the Owner, and are therefore considered as due to related parties.  These credit facilities and agreements are generally established on an as-needed basis between the Group and the Owner at amounts equal to the borrowings.  Accordingly, there are no additional agreed-upon borrowing availability or limits between the Group and the Owner under these or any additional credit facilities and cash pooling agreements.  As at December 31, 2008 and 2007, the weighted average interest rates on the Group's short-term borrowings due to related parties were 1.7% and 5.6%, respectively.  The interest rate on the Group's variable rate short-term borrowings fluctuates with movements in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).  The following table shows the details of the Group's short-term borrowings due to related parties:

16.          OTHER LIABILITIES
 
 
17.          POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
 
Certain businesses included in the Group have established postretirement benefit plans.
 
Funded Pension Plans
 
The Group's pension obligations relate mostly to funded defined benefit pension plans in Canada, the US and Mexico (Funded Pension Plans).  Pension benefits are generally based on the employee's service and highest average eligible compensation before retirement.
 
Most of the Group's Funded Pension Plans are administered by a Pension Committee or Board of Trustees composed of plan members designated by the Group and employees.  Each Committee or Board of Trustees adopts its own investment policy which generally favors diversification and active management of plan assets through selection of specialized managers.  Investments are generally limited to publicly traded stocks and high-rated debt securities, excluding securities in Rio Tinto (Alcan, prior to the Rio Tinto acquisition), and include only small amounts in other asset categories.  Depending on the age distribution of the plan participants, target allocation varies, and is shown below:
 
 
The Group's pension funding policy is to contribute the amount required to provide for contractual benefits attributed to service to date and to amortize unfunded actuarial liabilities for the most part over periods of 15 years or less.  The Group expects to contribute $11,107 in the aggregate to its Funded Pension Plans in the year ending December 31, 2009.

The following tables present the changes in the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and in the fair value of plan assets of the Group's Funded Pension Plans:
 
 
(A)
             
During the year ended December 31, 2008, and the periods from October 24, 2007 through December 31, 2007 and from January 1, 2007 through October 23, 2007, current service cost and interest cost include transfers to Owners' net investment of $4,235, $717 and $3,719, respectively.
 
 
The funded status is recognized in the Group's combined balance sheets as follows:
 
 
For certain Funded Pension Plans, the PBO exceeds the fair value of plan assets.  For these plans, as at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, the PBO is $131,098 and $124,942; the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) is $115,127 and $109,113; and the fair value of plan assets is $81,982 and $116,918.
 
The total ABO of Funded Pension Plans as at December 31, 2008 and 2007 is $125,995 and $121,308, respectively.  For certain Funded Pension Plans, the ABO exceeds the fair value of plan assets.  For these plans, as at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, the PBO is $131,098 and $33,927; the ABO is $115,127 and $33,927; and the fair value of plan assets is $81,982 and $29,460.

The components of the Group's net periodic benefit cost related to Funded Pension Plans are shown in the following table:
 
 
Unfunded Retirement Benefits and Other Postretirement Benefits
 
Certain businesses included in the Group also sponsor unfunded retirement benefit plans and other postretirement benefit plans.  Retirement benefits are in the form of defined benefit pension plans (unfunded retirement benefits).  They provide pensions based on the employee's service and highest average eligible compensation before retirement and are periodically adjusted for cost of living increases in accordance with statutory requirements.  Lump sum retirement indemnities are based on compensation prior to retirement and on length of company service.  Certain businesses included in the Group also sponsor unfunded other postretirement benefit obligations, mostly comprised of health care benefits for retired employees in the US (other benefits).  These pension and other postretirement benefits are managed separately and any related assets, liabilities and costs are included in the Group's combined financial statements.
 
The following tables present the changes in the projected benefit obligations of Unfunded Retirement Benefits and of Other Benefits:

During the year ending December 31, 2009, $3,447 in estimated net actuarial losses (gains) for the Pension Plans (Funded Pension Plans and Unfunded Retirement Benefits) and $(234) in Other Benefits will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic benefit cost.
 
Pensions and Other Benefits Assumptions
 
Assumptions used to determine projected benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost are shown in the following tables:
 
RIO TINTO ALCAN PACKAGING  FOOD AMERICAS
NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands of US$, except per share amounts and unless stated otherwise)
 
In estimating the expected return on assets of a Funded Pension Plan, consideration is given primarily to its target allocation, the current yield on long-term bonds in the country where the plan is established, and the historical risk premium in each relevant country of equity or real estate over long-term bond yields.  The approach is consistent with the principle that assets with higher risk provide a greater return over the long term.
 
The assumed healthcare cost trend used for measurement purposes is 8.5% for 2009, decreasing gradually to 5.0% in 2015 and remaining at that level thereafter.  A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:
 
 
Defined Contribution Plans
 
The Group sponsors savings plans in Canada and the US.  During the year ended December 31, 2008, the periods from October 24, 2007 through December 31, 2007 and from January 1, 2007 through October 23, 2007; and the year ended December 31, 2006, the Group contributed $8,685; $988; $7,489; and $8,801, respectively to such plans.
 
Pension Costs of Divisions
 
For benefit plans of divisions of the Owners included in the Group for which the plans are managed by the Owners, the pension costs are accounted for by including their share of the service cost and allocating the other components of the pension costs based on their share of the PBO.  During the year ended December 31, 2008, the periods from October 24, 2007 through December 31, 2007 and from January 1, 2007 through October 23, 2007; and the year ended December 31, 2006, total pension costs of these divisions allocated to the Group amounted to $5,758; $903; $6,052; and $6,298, respectively.  For these plans, none of the plan assets or projected benefit obligations are included in the Group's combined balance sheets.
 
18.          DISPOSALS AND ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES AND INVESTMENTS
 
The Group disposes of and acquires businesses and investments from time to time in the normal course of business.  Significant disposals and acquisitions are described below.  Gains and losses on disposals are included in Other expenses (income)  net in the Group's combined statements of operations, unless otherwise indicated.
 
The Group had no disposals or acquisitions of businesses and investments during the year ended December 31, 2008 or during the periods from October 24, 2007 through December 31, 2007 and January 1, 2007 through October 23, 2007.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Group acquired the packaging assets and business of Recubrimientos y Laminaciones de Papel, S.A. de C.V. (Relapasa) of Monterrey, Mexico, a food and specialty flexible packaging business, for a total cost of $21,800.  The acquisition was financed by $14,000 paid in cash at closing and $7,800 in a non-interest-bearing note payable with scheduled payments due in 2007 and 2008.  The business is included in the Group's Food and Specialty North America operating segment.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Group decided to discontinue operations at its North America Food Packaging Plastic Bottle businesses.  During the year ended December 31, 2006, the net assets of these businesses were sold for net proceeds of $181,922, resulting in a loss on disposal of $(2,815), which was included in (Loss) from discontinued operations in the Group's combined statement of operations (see Note 3  Discontinued Operations).

19.          FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
Financial Risk Management
 
The Group's policies with regard to financial risk management are determined and governed by its Owners.  The Owners' financial risk management strategy focuses on minimizing the cost to the Owners of having the financial flexibility required to execute its business strategy, by achieving the best mix of capital structure and risk transfer instruments in support of its business portfolio composition, business plan, growth plans, investment program and investor expectations.
 
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange, commodity price, interest rate and credit risks in the normal course of business.
 
Foreign exchange risk
 
The Group operates in the US, Mexico, Brazil, Canada, Argentina and New Zealand and the substantial majority of its net investment, earnings and cash flows are primarily influenced by and denominated in the US Dollar, Mexican Peso and Brazilian Real.  The Group
uses a minimal amount of foreign currency derivatives to hedge commercial transactions, recognized assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
 
Commodity price risk
 
The Group is subject to the effects of market fluctuations in materials and energy pricing.  The Group has entered into certain derivative contracts (forward contracts) for natural gas only
.
 
Commodity price risk refers to the risk that the value of derivative financial instruments that are held by the Group related to natural gas will fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
 
Interest rate risk
 
The Group has a substantial amount of outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt with third and related parties, most of which are variable rate index-based loans entered into at market rates at inception.  As at both December 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately 88% of the Group's total short-term borrowings and long-term debt were at variable rates.
 
The Group's capital structure also includes substantial amounts of short- and long-term loans receivable from related parties, the majority of which are variable rate index-based loans entered into at market rates at inception.  As at both December 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately 98% of the Group's total short- and long-term loans receivable from related parties were at variable rates.
 
The Group's position as a lender on variable rate loans partially mitigates its risk as a borrower on variable rate loans. 
The Group does not use any interest rate derivatives to hedge against market fluctuations in interest rates.
 
Credit risk
 
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss.  The Group is exposed to credit risk from deposits it has with banks and financial institutions, from its operating activities (primarily related to customer trade receivables) and from its investing activities, including loans receivable from related parties.  The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial asset as shown on the Group's combined balance sheets.  The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
 
Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions has historically been managed by the Owners' treasury department in accordance with a Board-approved policy.  Group
management is not aware of any significant risks associated with these cash deposits.
 
The responsibility for customer credit risk management rests with Group management.  Payment terms vary and are set in accordance with practices in the different geographies and end-markets served.  Credit limits are typically established based on internal or external rating criteria, which take into account such factors as the financial condition of the customer, their credit history and the risk associated with their industry segment.  Trade accounts receivable are actively monitored and managed, at the business unit or site level.  Business units report credit exposure information to Group management on a regular basis.  In situations where collection risk is considered to be above acceptable levels, risk is mitigated through the use of advance payments, letters of credit or credit insurance.  The Group has a diverse customer base geographically and by industry segment.  No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Group's total trade receivables at either December 31, 2008 or 2007.
 
Financial Instruments
 
Derivatives
 
Group uses various derivative financial instruments to manage the risks arising from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and natural gas prices.  Generally, such derivative instruments are used for risk management purposes only.  Alcan was the counterparty to all of the Groups' derivative instruments until the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.  During the fourth quarter of
The
RIO TINTO ALCAN PACKAGING  FOOD AMERICAS
NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands of US$, except per share amounts and unless stated otherwise)
2007, all of the counterparty positions held by Alcan were transferred at fair value to FEEP (an entity within Alcan Packaging but excluded from the Group), and immediately cash-settled by FEEP with Alcan.  As a result of the aforementioned transfer, FEEP is the counterparty to all of the Group's derivative instruments as at December 31, 2008 and 2007.
 
Financial Statement Disclosures
 
All of the assets and liabilities and gains and losses relating to derivative transactions between the business operating units of the Group and FEEP are included in the accompanying Group combined financial statements, and are identified as related party transactions.
 
None of the Group's derivatives qualify as hedges or are accounted for using hedge accounting, and therefore all of the Group's derivatives are carried at fair value, with any changes included as unrealized (gains) losses in Other expenses (income)  net  related parties in the Group's combined statements of operations.  Realized (gains) losses from the settlement of derivatives are reclassified from Other expenses (income)  net  related parties and included in Cost of sales and operating expenses.
 
The following unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives are recognized in Other expenses (income)  net  related parties in the Group's combined statements of operations:
 
 
The Group has the following assets and liabilities (all of which are current) arising from derivatives recognized at fair value in its combined balance sheets:
 
 
Current derivative assets are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets  related parties and current derivative liabilities are included in Payables and accrued liabilities  related parties in the Group's combined balance sheets.

All unexercised Alcan Executive Share Options and certain Pechiney Stock Options were exercised in October 2007 using a cashless exercise mechanism.  Immediately before the taking up of Alcan common shares (Common Shares or Shares) under the Rio Tinto Offer, Alcan issued a number of Common Shares equal to (A) the total in-the-money value of options held by all optionees (using the Rio Tinto Offer price of $101 per Share of Alcan common stock, less the US dollar equivalent of the exercise price for each option), divided by (B) $101 per Share.  These newly issued Shares were then tendered into the Rio Tinto Offer on behalf of the optionees.

A total cash payment of $4,964 was made in the fourth quarter of 2007 to the Group's employees related to the settlement of Alcan's Long-Term Incentive Plans.  Payments under the Restricted Share Unit Plan, Stock Price Appreciation Unit Plan, Executive Deferred Share Unit Plan and Non-Executive Directors Deferred Share Unit Plan were based on the Rio Tinto Offer price of $101 per Share.  All previously unrecognized other share-based compensation expense was recorded in October 2007.

Stock Option Plans
 
Alcan Executive Share Option Plan
 
Under the Alcan Executive Share Option Plan, certain key employees were entitled to purchase Common Shares of Alcan at an exercise price that was based on the market value of the Shares on the date of the grant of each option.  These Common Shares were issued from treasury.  Options granted beginning in 1998 vested (not less than three months after the grant date) in respect of one-third of the grant when the market value of the Share had increased by 20% over the exercise price, two-thirds of the grant when the market value of the Share had increased by 40%, and the entire amount of the grant when the market value of the Share had increased by 60%.  The market value must have exceeded these thresholds for at least 21 consecutive trading days.  All options that did not attain the thresholds above vested nine years after the grant date.  All options expired ten years after the grant date.  In the event of death or retirement, any remainder of this ten-year period in excess of five years was reduced to five years, and the said thresholds were waived.  Options granted before 1998 vested generally over a fixed period of four years from the grant date and expired at various dates during the next ten years.  Upon consummation of the combination with Alusuisse Group Ltd. on October 17, 2000, all options granted prior to the consummation were vested.  In respect of certain options granted to certain senior executives in 1996, 1997 and 1998, Alcan granted further options which became effective upon the exercise of the associated options and upon the executive placing at least one-half of the Common Shares resulting from the exercise of these options in trust with an agency named by Alcan, for a minimum period of five years.  The exercise price of these options was based on the market value of the Common Shares on the exercise date of the associated options.  These options were exercisable in the same manner, and would also have terminated on the same date, as the associated options.  The vesting provisions of these options were identical to those of the associated options.

Derived Service Period
 
For options granted prior to January 1, 2006, compensation expense was recognized over a requisite service period of no longer than nine years.
 
In 2006, Alcan reviewed its long-term incentive compensation.  As a result of this review, beginning in the third quarter of 2006,
the practice of granting options under the Alcan Executive Share Option Plan was suspended in favor of Restricted Share Units in accordance with the Restricted Share Unit Plan.
 
Pechiney Stock Option Plans
 
Under the stock option plans of Pechiney, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of RTA, certain officers and employees were granted options to subscribe to or to purchase Pechiney common shares.  These options were last granted in April 2003.
 
As a result of the Pechiney acquisition, Alcan and Pechiney agreed on the terms of a liquidity agreement which was made available to beneficiaries of Pechiney subscription and purchase options ("Liquidity Agreement"). The Liquidity Agreement allowed the holders of Pechiney options to either (a) exchange their Pechiney shares resulting from the exercise of the Pechiney options for Alcan Common Shares on the basis of a ratio equivalent to the consideration offered under Alcan's public offer for Pechiney or (b) give up their Pechiney options and receive new options to subscribe for Alcan Common Shares on the basis of a ratio equivalent to the consideration offered under Alcan's public offer for Pechiney. Upon the clearance by the French

Stock Price Appreciation Unit Plan
 
A small number of employees were entitled to receive Stock Price Appreciation Units (SPAU) instead of Alcan Executive Share Options due to certain local considerations in their countries of residence, whereby they were entitled to receive cash in an amount equal to the excess of the market value of a Common Share on the date of exercise of a SPAU over the market value of a Common Share as of the date of grant of such SPAUs.  SPAUs vested in the same manner as the Alcan Executive Share Options granted beginning in 1998.
 
As described in Note 1  Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the Group began recording all outstanding liability awards, previously recorded at intrinsic value, at fair value on January 1, 2006.  Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2006, the Group recorded an after-tax charge of $162 using the modified prospective application method in Cumulative effect of accounting change to record all outstanding SPAUs, previously measured at their intrinsic value, at their fair value.  The fair value of all outstanding SPAUs was estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model described under the Alcan Executive Share Option Plan.
 
As of January 1, 2006, the SPAUs were accounted for as liability-classified awards under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), as they were settled in cash.  These awards were measured at their fair value at grant date, and remeasured at each reporting period until the SPAUs were settled.  The fair values of the awards were amortized over the requisite service period of no longer than nine years.
 
In 2006, Alcan reviewed its long-term incentive compensation. As a result of this review, beginning in the third quarter of 2006, the practice of granting SPAUs under the Stock Price Appreciation Unit Plan was suspended in favor of Restricted Share Units in accordance with the Restricted Share Unit Plan.

Other information relating to SPAUs related to employees of the Group is summarized below:
 
 
Total Shareholder Return Performance Plan
 
A number of employees were entitled to receive cash awards under the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) Performance Plan (TSR Plan), a cash incentive plan that provided performance awards to eligible employees based on the relative performance of Alcan's Common Share price and cumulative dividend yield compared to other companies included in the Standard & Poor's Industrials Index measured over three-year periods commencing on October 1, 2004, 2005 and 2006.  Generally, participants were only eligible for payment of cash awards under the TSR Plan if they were employed by Alcan over the entire three-year period.  If the performance results for Alcan's Common Shares ranked below the 30
th
 percentile compared to all companies in the Standard & Poor's Industrials Index, the employee would not have received an award.  At the 30
th
 percentile rank, the employee would have been paid an award equal to 60% of the target.  At the 50
th
 percentile rank, the employee would have earned a payout of 100% of the target, and at or above the 75
th
 percentile rank, the employee would have earned the maximum award, which was equal to 300% of the target set for the three-year period. The actual amount of the award (if any) would have been prorated between the percentile rankings.
 
At various times in 2006,
the TSR Plan was amended, including as follows: the comparative group of companies was changed from the Standard & Poor's Industrials Index to the Standard & Poor's Materials Index; and the maximum payout amount was modified. At or above the 75
th
 percentile rank, the employee would have earned the maximum award, which was equal to
 
RIO TINTO ALCAN PACKAGING  FOOD AMERICAS
NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands of US$, except per share amounts and unless stated otherwise)
 
250% (rather than 300%) of the target. The actual amount of the award (if any) would have been prorated between the percentile rankings.
 
As described in Note 1  Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the Group began recording all outstanding liability awards at fair value on January 1, 2006.  Accordingly, on this date, the Group began recording all outstanding awards under the TSR Plan at fair value.  The fair value of all outstanding TSR awards was estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model to simulate the total shareholder return for each of the peer companies over the term of the three-year period and to evaluate Alcan's percentile rank among the peer companies in order to determine the payout.  The adoption of the fair value method did not have a material impact on the outstanding TSR awards on January 1, 2006.  Prior to this date, the TSR awards were measured at their intrinsic value and the changes in market value recorded as an increase (or decrease) in compensation expense.
 
As of January 1, 2006, the TSR awards were accounted for as liability-classified awards under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), as the majority were settled in cash.  These awards were measured at their fair value at grant date, and remeasured at each reporting period, until the TSR awards were settled.  The fair values of the awards were amortized over the three-year periods.
 
The valuation model used the following assumptions:
 
 
Alcan expected volatility for all peers was based on historical volatility.  The risk-free interest rate was based on the yield of    3-year US Treasury bonds.
 
The peer company expected volatility and correlation with the market at December 31, 2006, is summarized as follows:
 
Predecessor
 
 
During the period from January 1, 2007 through October 23, 2007 and for the year ended December 31, 2006, the Group granted total target cash awards of nil and $357, respectively.
 
The three-year period of the 2004 grant was completed on September 30, 2007.  The final rank for this three-year period was a combination of the percentile rankings for the periods before and after Alcan spun off certain of its rolled aluminum businesses to Novelis Inc. in January 2005.  As such, the employees participating during this three-year period earned a payout of 273.15% of the target and a payment of $477 was made to employees in October 2007 unrelated to the change in control payments.  In 2006, $23 (41.74% payout) was paid to employees for the 2003 grant.
 
Restricted Share Unit Plan
 
The Alcan Restricted Share Unit Plan (RSU Plan) was a new long-term incentive plan that was introduced in the third quarter of 2006.

NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands of US$, except per share amounts and unless stated otherwise)
 
The RSU Plan provided for the granting of Restricted Share Units (RSUs) to eligible participants. The RSUs had a vesting period of no longer than three years.  The participants were credited additional RSUs corresponding to dividends declared on Common Shares. The RSUs were redeemed in cash, or an equivalent number of Common Shares purchased on the open market for fiscal residents in France (see below), at the end of the vesting period based on the fair market value (defined as the average of the closing prices of Alcan's Common Shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) over the previous 21 trading days on that date multiplied by the number of RSUs held by the participant).
 
The RSUs were accounted for as liability-classified awards under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), as the majority would have been settled in cash.  These awards were measured at their fair value at grant date, and remeasured at each reporting period, until the RSUs were settled.  The fair value of the award, which was equal to the closing price of an Alcan Common share on the NYSE, was amortized over the requisite service period of no longer than three years.
 
Changes in the number of number of RSUs related to employees of the Group are summarized below:
 
 
Other Restricted Share Units
 
As a result of the spin-off, Other RSUs held prior to the Novelis Inc. spin-off were converted in the same manner as described under the Alcan Executive Share Option Plan.
Prior to September 2006, a small number of employees were granted Other Restricted Share Units (Other RSUs). Additional Other RSUs were credited to each holder thereof corresponding to dividends declared on Common Shares.  Other RSUs usually vested three years after the grant date. Each Other RSU carried the right to an amount equal to the average price of a Common Share on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges on the five trading days ending on the vesting date. 
 
The Other RSUs were accounted for as liability-classified awards under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), as the majority would have been settled in cash.  These awards were measured at their fair value at grant date, and remeasured at each reporting period until settlement.  The fair value of the award was amortized over the requisite service period of three years.
 
Changes in the number of number of Other RSUs related to employees of the Group are summarized below:
 
 
.
During the period from January 1, 2007 through October 23, 2007 and the year ended December 31, 2006, the Group paid $267 and $62, respectively, for the redemption of Other RSUs

Total Share-Based Compensation Expense
 
As a result of the total settlement of all share-based compensation plans in October 2007, none of the plans had any activity for the year ended December 31, 2008 or the period from October 24, 2007 through December 31, 2007, and accordingly, the Group incurred no share-based compensation expense during those periods.
 
The components of total share-based compensation expense incurred by the Group, and the related total recognized tax expense (benefit) are summarized below:
 
 
The fair value of all compensation costs not yet recognized at each of December 31, 2008 and 2007 is nil.
 
As a result of the settlement of all share-based compensation liabilities due to the acquisition of Alcan by Rio Tinto, total share-based compensation expense for the period from January 1, 2007 through October 23, 2007 includes approximately $3,392 related to the accelerated vesting of all previously unvested awards.

22.          COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
Commitments
 
Operating Leases
 
The Group leases certain buildings, machinery and equipment under various operating lease agreements.  Total operating lease expense was as follows:
 
 
As at December 31, 2008,
the Group's future minimum payments under non-cancellable operating leases
are as follows:
 
 
License Agreement
 
The Group
licenses certain intellectual property rights from the Owner under the terms of a License Agreement, which expires at the earlier date at which (i) appropriate notice is provided by either party of the License Agreement to the other party, or (ii) the last active patent related to the intellectual property rights under the License Agreement expires.  Under the terms of the License Agreement, the Owner grants to the Group a worldwide right and license to make, have made, use, develop, manufacture, produce, market, import, export, offer for sale, and sell products and to provide services and to create improvements, using the Licensed Intellectual Property, for a license fee equal to five percent of net sales of all products in the Licensed Field, as defined, less certain expenses.  The license fee is paid quarterly by the Group, and is included in Selling and administrative expenses  related parties in the Group's combined statement of operations.  See Note 21  Related Party Transactions for amounts. 
As at December 31, 2008,
the Group's total future license fee payments under the License Agreement are not estimable.
 
Contingencies
 
Since the date of the Acquisition, certain of the Group's executives are covered under the Rio Tinto directors' and officers' liability insurance policy.  In broad terms, the policy indemnifies such individuals for personal legal liability and costs for claims arising out of actions taken in connection with Group business.
 
Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against the Group, including those pertaining to environmental or commercial matters, product quality and taxes.  While the amounts claimed may be substantial, the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist.  Therefore, it is possible that results of operations or liquidity in a particular future period could be materially affected by certain contingencies.  However, based on facts currently available, Group management believes that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or liquidity of the Group.  Accruals have been made in specific instances where it is probable that liabilities will be incurred and where such liabilities can be reasonably estimated.  The only significant proceeding in which the Group is involved is described below.
 
Brazil Antitrust Proceeding
 
In September 2007, the Secretariat of Economic Law of the Federative Republic of Brazil instituted an administrative proceeding under the Brazilian Antitrust Law, alleging that the Brazilian Laminated Flexible Packaging Association, along with 30 flexible packaging companies and certain of their current and former executives, engaged in collusive activities to divide among them the flexible packaging market in Brazil.  The defendants included Alcan Embalagens do Brasil Ltda (part of the Group) and one of its former executives.
 
RIO TINTO ALCAN PACKAGING  FOOD AMERICAS
NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands of US$, except per share amounts and unless stated otherwise)
 
In connection with this proceeding, the Group recorded management's best estimate of our expected liability in the Acquisition accounting as described in Note 2  Acquisition of Alcan by Rio Tinto.  The liability was included in Payables and accrued liabilities in the Group's combined balance sheet as at December 31, 2007.  In July 2008, the administrative proceeding was concluded in its entirety.  In August 2008, the Group paid approximately $16,300 to the Brazilian authorities (Secretaria de Direito Economico) in full settlement of its liability under the proceeding.
 
Other items
 
Although there is a possibility that liabilities may arise in other instances for which no accruals have been made, Group management does not believe that any losses in excess of accrued amounts would be sufficient to significantly impair the Group's operations, have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial position or liquidity, or materially and adversely affect the Group's results of operations for any particular reporting period, in the absence of unusual circumstances.
 
23.          INFORMATION BY OPERATING SEGMENT
 
The Group's segments manufacture a wide range of packaging products for the food, meat, dairy and beverage industries, and are producers of flexible and rigid specialty packaging products, converting plastics, plastic film, foil and paper materials into value-added packaging.  The Group owns and operates a dedicated flexible packaging research and development facility in North America and also benefits from the Owner's dedicated flexible food packaging research and development center in Europe.  This allows the Group to provide packaging solution expertise in wide-ranging markets around the world, including for products such as beverages, bakery, cookies, cereals, confectionery, dairy products, fresh and frozen food, instant products, pet food, retorted foods, fresh meat, labels and snacks.
 
The principal manufacturing activities of the Group's food packaging segments are the printing, coating and lamination of plastic film, aluminium foil, containers and paper into primary packaging materials for food manufacturers.  These food packaging businesses also produce their own engineered films.  The main processes used are rotogravure and flexographic printing, adhesive and extrusion lamination, wax or plastic extrusion and various coating processes to add barrier properties, sealability or gloss.
 
The businesses of the Group are organized into five operating segments based upon the product sector, markets and geographical areas they serve, as follows:
 
Food and Specialty North America
 
This segment manufactures products including laminates, films and lidding, dry food packaging and pouches.  The segment sells into the liquid beverage, condiments, packaged food, confectionary, coffee, pet food, household and personal care, bakery, salty snack, dairy and labels product sectors.  Food and Specialty North America operates 12 facilities throughout the US, Mexico and Canada.
 
Food South America
 
This segment manufactures products including laminates, films and lidding, blister packaging, vacuum packaging, fresh meat and dry food packaging.  The segment sells into the pharmaceutical, confectionary, coffee, fresh and processed meat and cheese, yogurt and dry food product sectors.  Food South America operates three facilities in Argentina and Brazil.
 
Meat and Dairy
 
This segment manufactures products including laminates, films and lidding, shrink bags, vacuum packaging and thermoformed trays.  The segment sells into the fresh and processed meat, natural cheese, processed cheese and other dairy flexibles product sectors.  Meat and Dairy operates five facilities in the US and Mexico.
 
Labels America
 
This segment manufactures laminated, roll-fed labels and roll-on, shrink-on labels primarily for the beverage markets In North America.  Labels America operates two facilities in the US and Canada.
 
Alcan Packaging Danaflex
 
This segment manufactures products including shrink bags and vacuum packaging.  The segment sells primarily into the fresh meat product sector throughout Australasia.  Alcan Packaging Danaflex operates a single facility in New Zealand.
 
Intersegment and Other
 
Excluded from the Group's operating segments as described above, the Group recognizes certain sales and operating revenues, costs and net assets as intersegment and other (as described in more detail below).
 
RIO TINTO ALCAN PACKAGING  FOOD AMERICAS
NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands of US$, except per share amounts and unless stated otherwise)
 
Business Group Profit
 
Group management measures the profitability and financial performance of the Group's operating segments based on Business Group Profit (BGP), in accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosure About the Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.  BGP is not a measurement of profitability that is recognized under GAAP.  Nonetheless, the Group's chief operating decision maker uses BGP to measure the Group's underlying operating segment results in a manner that is in line with the Group's portfolio approach to risk management.  BGP is comprised of earnings before: (a) interest expense; (b) income taxes; (c) depreciation and amortization; (d) goodwill impairment charges; (e) asset impairment charges not included in restructuring programs; (f) pension actuarial gains (losses) and adjustments  net; (g) unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives  net; and (h) intersegment and other.
 
Intersegment and other is comprised of items that are not under the control of the operating segments or considered in the measurement of their profitability.  These items are generally managed by the Group's head office, which focuses on strategy development and oversees governance, policy, legal, compliance, human resources and finance matters.  They include such items as
pass-through entities for import/export or income tax purposes, corporate and head office costs, businesses that have been sold, the deferral or realization of profits on intersegment sales, and other non-operating items.  Specifically, intersegment and other items include
: (a) corporate and head office costs; (b) license fees for intellectual properties; (c) certain restructuring charges  net (relating to major corporate-wide acquisitions or initiatives, and which may include asset impairment charges); (d) interest income; (e) gains (losses) on sales of property, plant and equipment  net; (f) gains (losses) on disposals of businesses and investments  net; and (g) other items  net.
 
With the exception of the items excluded from BGP as described above, the accounting principles used to prepare the information by operating segment are the same as those used to prepare the Group's combined financial statements.  Transactions between operating segments are conducted on an arm's-length basis and reflect market prices.
 
The following table shows Business Group Profit (Loss) by segment and reconciles Total Business Group Profit (a non-GAAP measure) to Net income (loss) from continuing operations.

1.             BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Description of Business
 
Rio Tinto Alcan Packaging  Food Americas (the Group or Packaging  Food Americas), which is a component of Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. (RTA), is held for sale.  On October 23, 2007, Rio Tinto plc, a part of the Rio Tinto Group (Rio Tinto), acquired Alcan Inc. (Alcan) in a transaction referred to herein as the "Acquisition."  Prior to the Acquisition, Alcan had announced plans to sell all of its food, pharmaceutical and medical, beauty and personal care and tobacco packaging businesses (Alcan Packaging), which included 128 plants in 31 countries.  Upon the completion of the Acquisition in October 2007, Rio Tinto continued with Alcan's previously established plan to sell Alcan Packaging.
 
Rio Tinto Alcan Packaging  Food Americas includes only the food packaging businesses of Alcan Packaging operating in North America, South America and New Zealand, with 23 plants located in six countries.  The Group is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, United States of America (US).
 
References herein to the "Group," "Packaging  Food Americas," "we," "our," or "us" refer to Rio Tinto Alcan Packaging  Food Americas, unless the context specifically indicates otherwise.  When used throughout this document: (i) RTA refers to Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. and, where applicable, one or more of its subsidiaries, affiliates and joint ventures; (ii) Alcan refers to Alcan Inc. and, where applicable, one or more of its subsidiaries, affiliates and joint ventures; (iii) Rio Tinto refers to the Rio Tinto Group and, where applicable, one or more of its subsidiaries, affiliates and joint ventures; and (iv) Owner(s) refers to either Rio Tinto or Alcan or both, depending on the period(s) referenced by the context therein, and based upon the acquisition of Alcan by Rio Tinto on October 23, 2007.
 
Interim Reporting
 
The accompanying unaudited condensed combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited combined financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008.  Management believes that all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of results, consisting of normally recurring items, have been included in the unaudited condensed combined financial statements for the interim periods presented.  The unaudited results of operations for the interim periods shown in these condensed financial statements are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the entire fiscal year.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the combined financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  The principal areas of judgment relate to derivative financial instruments, impairment of long-lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets and income taxes.
 
Basis of Presentation
 
The Group's unaudited condensed combined financial statements
are presented using GAAP.  The Group has elected to use the US dollar as its reporting currency.  Management believes the assumptions underlying the unaudited condensed combined financial statements, including the allocations described below, are reasonable.  However, the unaudited condensed combined financial statements included herein may not necessarily reflect the Group's results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the future or what its results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had the Group been a stand-alone entity during the periods presented.
 
As these unaudited condensed combined financial statements represent a portion of the businesses of the Owners which do not constitute a separate legal entity, the net assets of the Group have been presented as Owners' net investment in the Group.  The Owners' net investment in the Group is comprised primarily of the initial investment to establish the net assets of the Group (and any subsequent adjustments thereto), the accumulated net income (losses) of the Group, net transfers to or from the Owners, including those related to cash management functions performed by the Owners, non-cash changes in financing arrangements, corporate cost allocations and changes in certain income tax liabilities or assets.
 
The unaudited condensed combined financial statements have been derived from the accounting records of the Owners using the historical results of operations and historical bases of assets and liabilities of the businesses comprising the Group (including push down accounting, as described below), and were prepared in accordance with GAAP on a carve-out accounting basis.
 
The condensed combined balance sheet data as at December 31, 2008 was derived from the Group's audited combined financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP.
 
RIO TINTO ALCAN PACKAGING  FOOD AMERICAS
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
MARCH 31, 2009
(in thousands of US$, unless stated otherwise)
 
Push Down Accounting
 
The effects of the Acquisition of Alcan by Rio Tinto, and the subsequent adjustments to the carve-out basis of accounting applied to the Group were recorded in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) Topic 5J, Push Down Basis of Accounting Required in Certain Limited Circumstances.  Accordingly, in the accompanying unaudited condensed combined balance sheets, the portion of the total consideration and related costs paid by Rio Tinto in connection with the Acquisition and attributable to the Group have been pushed down to Packaging  Food Americas and have been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations.
 
Allocations from Owners
 
In addition to the carve out of businesses and entities comprising the operations and the net assets of the Group, the Group's unaudited condensed combined financial statements also include allocations of certain Owners' expenses, including the items described below.
 
The expenses allocated are not necessarily indicative of the expenses that would have been incurred had the Group performed these functions as a stand-alone entity, nor are they indicative of expenses that will be charged or incurred in the future.  It is not practicable to estimate the amount of expenses the Group would have incurred for the periods presented had it not been an affiliated entity of the Owners in each of those periods.
 
General Corporate Expenses
 
The Owners have allocated certain of their general corporate expenses to the Group based on average capital employed.  Capital employed represents Total Packaging  Food Americas assets, less: (a) current and non-current trade payables and other; (b) provisions; (c) deferred income tax assets; and (d) short-term and long-term loans receivable from related parties.  The general corporate expense allocations are included in Selling and administrative expenses  related parties in the Group's combined statements of operations.  These allocations are primarily for finance, human resources, legal, corporate and external affairs and the executive office of RTA and are mainly comprised of salaries, including variable compensation and normal current service cost for pensions, and other direct costs of the various functions.
 
The following table shows the general corporate expense allocations from the Owners and the Group's total head office costs, including the amounts allocated, for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008:
 
 
Pensions and Postretirement Benefits
 
Certain businesses included in the Group have pension obligations mostly comprised of funded defined benefit pension plans in the US, Canada and Mexico.  Certain businesses included in the Group also have unfunded other postretirement benefit obligations, mostly comprised of healthcare benefits for retired employees in the US.  The related assets, liabilities and costs of these pension and other postretirement benefit plans are included in the Group's unaudited condensed combined financial statements.
 
For benefit plans of divisions of the Owners included in the Group for which the plans are managed by the Owners, the pension costs are accounted for by including their share of the service cost and allocating the other components of the pension costs based on their share of the projected benefit obligation in the Group's combined statements of operations.  For these plans, none of the plan assets or projected benefit obligations are included in the Group's unaudited condensed combined balance sheets.
 
Income Taxes
 
Income taxes are calculated as if all of the Group's operations had been separate tax paying legal entities, each filing a separate tax return in its local tax jurisdiction.  Certain income tax amounts currently payable or receivable by the Group are included in Owners' net investment, because the net liability (receivable) for the taxes due (refundable) is recorded in the financial statements of the Owners' non-Group entity that files the consolidated tax return.  As a result of the aforementioned structure, substantially all of the Group's income tax liabilities (refunds) are also paid (collected) by the various Owners' non-Group entities.  The net changes in income tax amounts currently payable or receivable are included in net cash transfers (to) from Owners in the accompanying unaudited condensed combined financial statements.

(in thousands of US$, unless stated otherwise)
 
Cash Management
 
Cash and cash equivalents in the unaudited condensed combined balance sheets are comprised of the cash and cash equivalents of the Group's businesses.  None of the Owners' cash and cash equivalents has been allocated to the Group in the unaudited condensed combined financial statements.
 
Historically, the Group's businesses in South America and New Zealand have performed their own cash management functions, while the Owners have performed cash management functions on behalf of the Group's businesses in North America.  Cash deposits from the businesses in North America are transferred to the Owners on a regular basis.  Cash transfers to and from the Owners are included in the Owners' net investment.
 
Interest Expense
 
The Owners incur third party debt at the Owner level, and provide financing to the Group in the form of short-term borrowings and long-term debt.  This financing is included within the amounts due to related parties in the Group's unaudited condensed combined balance sheets and is substantially all interest-bearing at variable rates, as described in Note 13  Short-Term Borrowings and Debt and Note 17  Related Party Transactions.  Interest on this related party financing is included in Interest expense  related parties in the unaudited condensed combined statements of operations.  The Owners do not allocate any additional interest expense to the Group.
 
Earnings Per Share
 
The Group is not a separate legal entity with common shares outstanding.  Therefore, earnings per share information is not presented in the accompanying unaudited condensed combined financial statements.
 
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
 
The Group adopted the following accounting standards during the three months ended March 31, 2009.
 
On January 1, 2009, the Group adopted SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133.  The standard enhances the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities.  As SFAS No. 161 only required enhanced disclosures, the adoption of this standard had no impact on our combined financial statements.
 
On January 1, 2009, the Group adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position No. FAS 142-3, Determination of Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP FAS 142-3).  FSP FAS 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing the renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.  FSP FAS 142-3 also requires expanded disclosure related to the determination of intangible asset useful lives.  The adoption of FSP FAS 142-3 had no impact on the Group's combined financial statements.
 
On January 1, 2009, the Group adopted SFAS No. 141 (Revised), Business Combinations (SFAS 141(R)).  SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination (i) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, (ii) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase, and (iii) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination.  SFAS No. 141(R) also requires acquirers to estimate the acquisition-date fair value of any contingent consideration and to recognize any subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration in earnings.  The Group is required to apply this new standard prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies.  SFAS No. 141(R) amends certain provisions of SFAS No. 109 such that adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 141(R) would also apply the provisions of SFAS No. 141(R).  The adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) had no impact on the Group's combined financial statements.
 
In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active (FSP FAS 157-3).  The FSP clarifies the application of Statement of FASB 157 in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active.  FSP FAS 157-3 was effective upon issuance, and had no impact on our combined financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
 
The following new accounting standards have been issued, but have not yet been adopted by the Group as of March 31, 2009, as adoption is not required until future reporting periods.
 
In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets (SFAS No. 166).  SFAS No. 166 is a revision to SFAS No. 140  Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, and will require additional disclosure about the transfers of financial assets, including securitization transactions, and additional disclosure in cases where entities have continuing exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets.  The statement eliminates the concept of "qualifying special-purpose entity" and changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets.  SFAS No. 166 is effective for
annual and interim reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009.  Earlier application is prohibited and must be applied to transfers occurring on or after the effective date.  We have not determined the impact, if any, SFAS No. 166 will have on our combined financial statements.
 
In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165, Subsequent Events (SFAS No. 165) which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued.  It also requires the disclosure of the date through which subsequent events are evaluated and the basis for that date, that is, whether that date represents the date the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued.  The effective date for SFAS No. 165 is for interim or annual periods ending on or after June 15, 2009.  We are currently evaluating the effects that the adoption of SFAS No. 165 may have on our combined financial statements.
 
In April 2009, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 107-1 (FSP FAS 107-1) and APB Opinion 28-1 (APB 28-1), Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments.  FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 amend SFAS 107 and APB Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting, to require disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods.  FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 will be effective for interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009.  As FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 only require enhanced disclosures, they will have no impact on our combined financial statements.
 
In April 2009, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157-4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly (FSP FAS 157-4).  FSP FAS 157-4 provides additional guidance in accordance with FASB No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability has significantly decreased.  FSP FAS 157-4 will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009.  We are currently evaluating the effects that FSP FAS 157-4 may have on our combined financial statements.
 
In April 2009, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 115-2 (FSP FAS 115-2) and FASB Staff Position No. 124-2 (FSP FAS 124-2), Recognition of Other-than-Temporary-Impairments.  FSP FAS No. 115-2 and FSP FAS No. 124-2 amend the other-than-temporary impairment guidance in GAAP for debt and equity securities.  FSP FAS No. 115-2 and FSP FAS No. 124-2 will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009.  We are currently evaluating the effects that FSP FAS No. 115-2 and FSP FAS No. 124-2 may have on our combined financial statements.
 
In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 132 (R)-1, Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits (FSP No. 132(R)-1).  FSP No. 132(R)-1 requires that an employer disclose the following information about the fair value of plan assets: 1) how investment allocation decisions are made, including the factors that are pertinent to understanding of investment policies and strategies; 2) the major categories of plans assets; 3) the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets; 4) the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets for the period; and 5) significant concentrations of risk within plan assets.  FSP No. 132(R)-1 will be effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009, with early application permitted.  At initial adoption, application of FSP No. 132(R)-1 would not be required for earlier periods that are presented for comparative purposes.  We have not yet commenced evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of FSP No. 132(R)-1 on our combined financial statements.
 
We have determined that all other recently issued accounting standards will not have a material impact on our combined financial statements, or do not apply to our operations.

2.             RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS
 
During the three months ended March 31, 2009, there were no new restructuring programs approved or initiated by the Group.
 
Restructuring liabilities
 
The following table shows the activity by component of the Group's restructuring liabilities.
 
 
The provision balances as at March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 are included in Payables and accrued liabilities  third parties in the Group's unaudited condensed combined balance sheets (see Note 12  Payables and Accrued Liabilities).
 
Restructuring charges
 
During the three months ended March 31, 2009, we incurred severance costs related to ongoing programs in our Food and Specialty North America and Food South America operating segments of $241 and $234, respectively.  We also incurred other exit-related costs of $41 in connection with a continuing restructuring program in our Labels America operating segment, as further described below.
 
three months ended March 31, 2008, we incurred total restructuring charges of $1,000 in Labels America, comprised of severance and other exit-related costs of $547 and $453, respectively.
During 2008, we initiated a restructuring plan in our Labels America operating segment (approved during the year ended     December 31, 2007) to streamline operations, in order to better match capacity with demand while reducing costs.  The plan called for the closure of one facility and the transfer of certain equipment to another facility.  During the

4.             CURRENCY (GAINS) LOSSES  NET
 
The following amounts are included in Other expenses (income)  net:
 
 
The following amounts are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss):
 
 
5.             INCOME TAXES
 
 
The Group's effective tax rates for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 were higher than the applicable statutory rate of 35%, due primarily to (i) the movement of liabilities established pursuant to FIN 48 for uncertain tax positions and (ii) unrecorded tax benefits in Argentina.
 
As at March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the Group had unrecognized tax benefits of $6,277 and $6,823, respectively. The decrease in the three months ended March 31, 2009 is due primarily to the expiration of a statute of limitations on an uncertain tax position.  The Group recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of its income tax provision.
 
Certain unrecorded tax benefits liabilities, including related interest accruals, are included in Owners' net investment, in accordance with carve-out accounting guidelines as discussed in Note 1  Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
 
As a multi-jurisdiction tax payer, the Group is under continual audit by various taxing authorities on several open tax years. Therefore, it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns could significantly increase or decrease during the next 12 months.  However, based on the status of these examinations and the uncertainty surrounding the outcomes of audits and negotiations, it is not possible at this time to estimate the impact of any such changes, if any.
 
The Group conducts business internationally and, as a result, the entities within which the Group operates file income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions.  In the normal course of business, the Group is subject to examination by taxing authorities in these jurisdictions, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and New Zealand.  Foreign jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging from two to five years.  In general, the Group has tax years still open to examination in various jurisdictions ranging from the year 2003 and onward.

6.             TRADE RECEIVABLES
 
 
Sale of receivables
 
The Group's businesses in North America sell an undivided interest in certain third party trade receivables, without recourse, to the Owners, under an Eligible Operating Subsidiary Receivables Purchase Agreement.  The third party receivables are exchanged for receivables from the Owners, which are included in Trade receivables  related parties (see Note 17  Related Party Transactions).
 
The trade receivables from related parties balances as at March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 shown in the table above include approximately $46,195 and $46,114, respectively, related to receivables sold under this program, with approximately $5,684 and $7,997, respectively, held in reserve by the Owners.
 
The Owners charge the Group a purchase discount, which the Group charges back to the Owners as the Group acts as a service agent and administers the collection of the receivables sold.  The purchase discount and the offsetting servicing fee are included in Other expenses (income)  net  related parties.
 
Allowance for doubtful accounts
 
The allowance for doubtful accounts represents management's best estimate of probable losses inherent in the third party trade receivables balance.  Management determines the allowance based on known uncollectible accounts, historical experience and other currently available evidence.  Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows:

Future estimated amortization expense is approximately $13,400 for the remainder of fiscal 2009 and $17,900 for each of the four succeeding fiscal years.  Actual amounts may differ from these estimates due to such factors as customer turnover, impairments, additional intangible asset acquisitions and other events.

Fair values
 
In connection with the Acquisition, all of the Group's short-term borrowings and debt instruments were recorded at their fair values as at October 23, 2007, which resulted in adjustments to the principal amounts of certain of the Group's short-term borrowings and debt instruments.  The net fair value adjustment was a decrease of $(2,663), and is being amortized on a straight-line basis (which approximates the "effective interest amortization" method) over the life of the related borrowings into Interest expense  third and related parties.  During the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, $83 and $768, respectively, of the net fair value adjustment was amortized as additional Interest expense  third parties.
 
RIO TINTO ALCAN PACKAGING  FOOD AMERICAS
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
MARCH 31, 2009
(in thousands of US$, unless stated otherwise)
 
As at December 31, 2008, all of the fair value adjustments related to short-term borrowings had been amortized.  As at March 31, 2009, the remaining net fair value adjustment relating to debt was $235 (a net increase to fair value) and will be amortized to adjust interest expense in future periods.
 
Short-term borrowings
 
All of the Group's short-term borrowings consist of variable and fixed rate credit facilities and cash pooling agreements with various businesses and subsidiaries of the Owner, and are therefore considered as due to related parties.  These credit facilities and agreements are generally established on an as-needed basis between the Group and the Owner at amounts equal to the borrowings.  Accordingly, there are no additional agreed-upon borrowing availability or limits between the Group and the Owner under these or any additional credit facilities and cash pooling agreements.  As at March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the weighted average interest rates on the Group's short-term borrowings due to related parties were 1.9% and 1.7%, respectively.  The interest rate on the Group's variable rate short-term borrowings fluctuates with movements in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).  The following table shows the details of the Group's short-term borrowings due to related parties:
 
 
(A)
     
For borrowings showing a balance as at March 31, 2009, interest rates are the effective rates with the counterparty as at March 31, 2009.  For borrowings showing a balance only as at December 31, 2008, interest rates are the effective rates with the counterparty as at December 31, 2008.
 
(B)
       
Certain operating businesses within Alcan Packaging Canada, Ltd. that are included in the Group have borrowings from certain other operating businesses within Alcan Packaging Canada, Ltd. that are excluded from the Group.

During the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, we paid total benefits of $1,716 and $1,575, respectively, in connection with these plans.  We expect to pay additional benefits of $5,148 in connection with these plans during the remainder of 2009.
 
Information related to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

The Group also sponsors savings plans in Canada and the US.  During the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, we contributed $1,978 and $2,184, respectively, to these plans.  We expect to contribute an additional $5,934 to these plans during the remainder of 2009.
 
Pension Costs of Divisions
 
For benefit plans of divisions of RTA included in the Group for which the plans are managed by RTA, the pension costs of these divisions are accounted for by including their share of the service cost and allocating the other components of the pension costs based on their share of the PBO.  During the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, total pension costs

Commitments
 
License Agreement
 
The Group
licenses certain intellectual property rights from the Owner under the terms of a License Agreement.  The license fee is paid quarterly by the Group, and is included in Selling and administrative expenses  related parties in the Group's unaudited condensed combined statement of operations.  See Note 17  Related Party Transactions for amounts.
 
Contingencies
 
Since the date of the Acquisition, certain of the Group's executives are covered under the Rio Tinto directors' and officers' liability insurance policy.  In broad terms, the policy indemnifies such individuals for personal legal liability and costs for claims arising out of actions taken in connection with Group business.
 
Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against the Group, including those pertaining to environmental or commercial matters, product quality and taxes.  While the amounts claimed may be substantial, the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist.  Therefore, it is possible that results of operations or liquidity in a particular future period could be materially affected by certain contingencies.  However, based on facts currently available, Group management believes that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or liquidity of the Group.  Accruals have been made in specific instances where it is probable that liabilities will be incurred and where such liabilities can be reasonably estimated.
 
Other items
 
Although there is a possibility that liabilities may arise in other instances for which no accruals have been made, Group management does not believe that any losses in excess of accrued amounts would be sufficient to significantly impair the Group's operations, have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial position or liquidity, or materially and adversely affect the Group's results of operations for any particular reporting period, in the absence of unusual circumstances.
 
19.          INFORMATION BY OPERATING SEGMENT
 
The Group's segments manufacture a wide range of packaging products for the food, meat, dairy and beverage industries, and are producers of flexible and rigid specialty packaging products, converting plastics, plastic film, foil and paper materials into value-added packaging.  The Group owns and operates a dedicated flexible packaging research and development facility in North America and also benefits from the Owner's dedicated flexible food packaging research and development center in Europe.  This allows the Group to provide packaging solution expertise in wide-ranging markets around the world, including for products such as beverages, bakery, cookies, cereals, confectionery, dairy products, fresh and frozen food, instant products, pet food, retorted foods, fresh meat, labels and snacks.
 
The principal manufacturing activities of the Group's food packaging segments are the printing, coating and lamination of plastic film, aluminium foil, containers and paper into primary packaging materials for food manufacturers.  These food packaging businesses also produce their own engineered films.  The main processes used are rotogravure and flexographic printing, adhesive and extrusion lamination, wax or plastic extrusion and various coating processes to add barrier properties, sealability or gloss.

Group management measures the profitability and financial performance of the Group's operating segments based on Business Group Profit (BGP), in accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosure About the Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.  BGP is not a measurement of profitability that is recognized under GAAP.  Nonetheless, the Group's chief operating decision maker uses BGP to measure the Group's underlying operating segment results in a manner that is in line with the Group's portfolio approach to risk management.  BGP is comprised of earnings before: (a) interest expense; (b) income taxes; (c) depreciation and amortization; (d) goodwill impairment charges; (e) asset impairment charges not included in restructuring programs; (f) pension actuarial gains (losses) and adjustments  net; (g) unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives  net; and (h) intersegment and other.
 
Intersegment and other is comprised of items that are not under the control of the operating segments or considered in the measurement of their profitability.  These items are generally managed by the Group's head office, which focuses on strategy development and oversees governance, policy, legal, compliance, human resources and finance matters.  They include such items as
pass-through entities for import/export or income tax purposes, corporate and head office costs, businesses that have been sold, the deferral or realization of profits on intersegment sales, and other non-operating items.  Specifically, intersegment and other items include
: (a) corporate and head office costs; (b) license fees for intellectual properties; (c) certain restructuring charges  net (relating to major corporate-wide acquisitions or initiatives, and which may include asset impairment charges); (d) interest income; (e) gains (losses) on sales of property, plant and equipment  net; (f) gains (losses) on disposals of businesses and investments  net; and (g) other items  net.
 
With the exception of the items excluded from BGP as described above, the accounting principles used to prepare the information by operating segment are the same as those used to prepare the Group's unaudited condensed combined financial statements.  Transactions between operating segments are conducted on an arm's-length basis and reflect market prices.

Exhibit 99.(c)
On July 5, 2009, Bemis Company, Inc. ("Bemis") entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") with certain subsidiaries of Rio Tinto plc (the "Sellers"), pursuant to which Bemis agreed to acquire the food packaging business and certain related assets of the Sellers located in the United States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and New Zealand ("Food Americas") for approximately $1.2 billion (the "Acquisition").  The completion of the Acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), and the receipt of approval under the Mexican Federal Law on Economic Competition.  The Acquisition is intended to be financed with a combination of approximately $1.0 billion in debt and $200 million in equity.
 
The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information has been prepared to illustrate the effect of the proposed acquisition of Food Americas by Bemis, including the related financing.  The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Balance Sheet combines the historical balance sheets of Bemis and Food Americas, giving effect to the Acquisition as if it had occurred on March 31, 2009.  The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statements of Income combine the historical statements of income of Bemis and Food Americas, giving effect to the Acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2008. The historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to matters that are (1) directly attributable to the Acquisition, (2) factually supportable, and (3) with respect to the statements of income, expected to have a continuing impact on the operating results of the combined company. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Statements and:
 
                 
The historical unaudited interim financial statements of Bemis included in  Bemis' Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 filed with the SEC on May 11, 2009;
                 
The audited historical financial statements of Bemis, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008, included in Bemis' Current  Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 20, 2009;

The historical unaudited combined interim financial statements of Food Americas as of and for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 which is filed as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information has been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting. The unaudited pro forma combined
condensed
financial information will differ from our final acquisition accounting for a number of reasons, including the fact that our estimates of fair value are preliminary and subject to change when our formal valuation and other studies are finalized. The differences that will occur between the preliminary estimates and the final acquisition accounting could have a material impact on the accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Statements.
 
The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information is presented for informational purposes only. It has been prepared in accordance with the regulations of the SEC and is not necessarily indicative of what our financial position or results of operation actually would have been had we completed the acquisition at the dates indicated, nor does it purport to project the future financial position or operating results of the combined company.  It also does not reflect any cost savings, operating synergies or revenue enhancements that we may achieve with respect to the combined company nor the costs necessary to achieve those costs savings, operating synergies, revenue enhancements, or integrate the operations of Bemis and Food Americas.

Note 1  Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation
 
The aggregate purchase price for the Acquisition is $1,213,000 payable at closing, subject to certain customary adjustments both at and post closing (the "Purchase Price"). Bemis may, subject to certain conditions, pay up to $200,000 of the Purchase Price in Bemis stock with the balance of the Purchase Price to be paid in cash.
 
Total purchase consideration paid for the Acquisition is expected to be approximately $1,208,065, calculated as follows:
 
 
The estimated purchase consideration of $1,208,065 has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows:
 
 
For the purpose of preparing the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information, certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been measured at their estimated fair values as of March 31, 2009.  A final determination of fair values will be based on the actual net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of Food Americas that will exist on the date of the closing of the Acquisition and on our formal valuation and other studies when they are finalized. Accordingly, the fair values of the assets and liabilities included in the table above are preliminary and subject to change pending additional information that may become known to Bemis. An increase in the fair value of inventory, property, plant and equipment or any identifiable intangible assets will reduce the amount of goodwill in the combined condensed financial information, and may result in increased depreciation and/or amortization expense.
 
Of the $198,500 of acquired intangible assets, $105,000 was assigned to Customer Relationships with an estimated economic life of 20 years, $75,000 was allocated to Technology with an estimated economic life of 15 years, $15,000 was allocated to Tradenames with an economic life of 20 years, and $3,500 was allocated to Order Backlog with an economic life of less than 1 year. The determination of fair value for these assets was primarily based upon the expected discounted cash flows. The determination of useful life was based upon historical acquisition experience, economic factors, and future cash flows of the combined company.  The estimated annual amortization expense for these acquired intangible assets is approximately $11,000, using straight-line amortization, and has been included in the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statements of Income.  This amount does not include $3,500 related to Order Backlog which has not been included in the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statements of Income as it is considered non-recurring.
 
Inventories reflect an adjustment of $9,555 to record the inventory at its estimated fair market value. This amount is recorded in the March 31, 2009 Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Balance Sheet.  The increased inventory valuation will temporarily impact Bemis' cost of sales after closing and therefore it is considered non-recurring and is not included in the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statements of Income.
 
Property, Plant and Equipment reflects an adjustment of $54,927 to record at estimated fair market value.
 
A preliminary net deferred tax liability of $14,000 has been recognized in accordance with accounting for income taxes. This amount relates to $7,718 assumed as part of the transaction, plus $6,282 relating to the tax effect on differences between the values assigned and the estimated tax basis of assets and liabilities acquired.
 
Other assets reflect an adjustment of $10,702 to record assets related to the indemnity provisions of the Agreement, and are primarily related to environmental and tax matters.
 
Note 2  Balance Sheet Transaction Adjustments
 
These adjustments represent assets not acquired and liabilities not assumed pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. Excluded assets and liabilities primarily include cash and cash equivalents, third-party debt, loans receivable from and loans payable to Seller-related entities, and pension, post-retirement and other employee benefit plan liabilities.
Note 3  Debt Financing for the Acquisition
 
These adjustments reflect the expected debt financing required to fund the Acquisition and related transaction costs.  For purposes of these Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Statements, we have assumed that we will complete a debt financing by the time the transaction closes.  The assumed debt financing is as follows:
 
                 
Commercial paper of $248,115 at a current average interest rate of 0.7% (based on rates as of July 15, 2009)
                 
Notes payable due in 2014 and 2019 totaling $800,000 at a blended interest rate of approximately 7%
 
On July 5, 2009, we also expanded the commitments under our existing $425,000 revolving credit facility by $200,000, as described in the Form 8-K filed on July 9, 2009.  We do not expect to draw on the revolving facility on the assumption that the commercial paper market is available at the time the transaction closes. We expect to incur, and thus assumed the payment of, approximately $9,775 of financing fees associated with the debt financing, which will be amortized over periods of four to ten years in line with the maturity of the debt.
 
On July 5, 2009, we also entered into a commitment letter with certain lenders that have committed to provide up to $800,000 under a 364-day unsecured bridge loan facility to finance of a portion of the purchase price for the Acquisition.  For purposes of these Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Statements we have assumed that we will not need to draw on this facility given the financing plan described above.  In connection with this bridge loan facility, we incurred  $10,000 of fees which, for purposes of the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Balance Sheet, has been reflected as a cash payment and reduction to retained earnings of $6,300  (after tax).  Bemis did not assume any further fees related to the bridge facility as it is assumed that the bridge facility will not be drawn upon.  The fees paid under the bridge facility could increase significantly should Bemis need to draw on this facility.
 
Note 4 - Equity Financing for the Acquisition
 
Prior to the closing of the Acquisition, we intend to issue approximately $200,000 in common stock in a public offering (net of underwriting fees of approximately $9,424) to fund a portion of the purchase price.   Shares to be issued of 7,879,100 were calculated using the Bemis closing share price as of July 15, 2009, which was $26.58.  If the Bemis share price increases or decreases by $1 per share, the number of shares required to be issued would decrease by 285,678 shares or increase by 308,100 shares, respectively.
 
As described in our Form  8-K filed on July 9, 2009, in connection with the execution of the Agreement we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with an affiliate of the Sellers, pursuant to which we have agreed, but are not obligated, to sell at the closing of
the Acquisition, up to $200,000 in shares of common stock of the Company, at a per share purchase price equal to 95% of the ten-day volume-weighted average of the per share prices of the Company's common stock ending at the close of the trading day prior to the closing of the Acquisition.  For purposes of these Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Statements we have assumed that we will not have to issue shares pursuant to this arrangement.
 
Note 5  Statement of Income Transaction Adjustments
 
Represents the income statement impact of certain aspects of the Agreement.
  It consists primarily of (i) the elimination of  royalty payments to affiliates of the Seller that will cease upon the closing of the Acquisition and the transfer of  the related patents to us ($20,198 and $5,864 in year ended December 31, 2008 and three months ended March 31, 2009, respectively), and  (ii) the net impact of certain product sales that are not included in the Food Americas historical financial statements that will transfer to us after Closing, and certain product sales that are included in the Food Americas historical financial statements that will remain with Seller.
 
Note 6  Statement of Income Adjustments to Reflect Purchase Price Allocation
 
Represents the estimated adjustments to amortization and depreciation expense related to the fair value adjustments of certain intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.
  Depreciation expense relating to property, plant and equipment and amortization expense relating to Technology are included in Cost of Products Sold, and amortization expense relating to Customer Relationships and Tradenames are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.
 
Note 7  Statement of Income Adjustments to Reflect Financing
 
This adjustment reflects interest expense relating to approximately $1,048,115 of debt issued to fund the Acquisition as further described in Note 3, partially offset by the elimination of Food America's historical interest expense relating to debt not assumed.  This incremental interest expense includes approximately $2,000 over the next 12 months of amortization expense relating to deferred financing fees expected to be incurred at the time of close.
 
The actual rates of interest can change from those that are assumed in Note 3.  If the actual interest rates that are incurred when the debt is actually drawn were to increase or decrease by .125% from the rates we have assumed in estimating the pro forma interest adjustment, pro forma interest expense could increase or decrease by approximately $1,300 per year.
 
Note 8  Non-recurring Acquisition Expenses
 
This adjustment represents acquisition expenses reported by us  in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009.  We have reversed these expenses from the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statements of Income on the basis that they are non-
recurring
.  No adjustment was made for the annual period as all costs were capitalized in accordance with accounting guidance effective at that time.  In the first quarter of 2009, in accordance with the revised acquisition accounting guidelines, all historically capitalized costs were expensed and all costs incurred during the quarter were also expensed.
 
We expect to incur additional transaction costs, including financial and legal advisory fees, of approximately $20,275 through the transaction close date. As referenced in Note 3, we also incurred a $10,000 bridge financing fee.  The total of these costs has been recorded as a cash outlay of $30,275, a reduction to retained earnings of $19,073 and  a reduction to accrued income and other taxes of $11,202 on the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Balance Sheet.  These costs are excluded from the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statements of Income as they are considered non-recurring.
 
Note 9  Tax Adjustments
 
For purposes of these Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Statements, a blended statutory rate of 37% has been used for all periods and dates presented. This rate is an estimate and does not take into account any possible future tax events that may occur for the combined company.
