The Securities will be issued pursuant to an indenture (the "Indenture") dated as of June 15, 1995 between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association (formerly known as First Trust National Association), as Trustee (the "Trustee").
 
The Company hereby confirms its agreement with the several Underwriters concerning the purchase and sale of the Securities, as follows:

The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Securities Act"), a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-160681), including a prospectus (the "Base Prospectus"), relating to the Securities to be issued from time to time by the Company.  The Company has also filed with, or transmitted for filing to, or shall promptly hereafter file with or transmit for filing to, the Commission a prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Securities pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act (the "Prospectus Supplement"). The term "Registration Statement" means the registration statement, as amended at the time it becomes effective, including the information, if any, deemed pursuant to Rule 430A, 430B or 430C under the Securities Act to be part of the registration statement at the time of its effectiveness ("Rule 430 Information"). The term "Prospectus" means the Base Prospectus as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement specifically relating to the Securities in the form first used (or made available upon request of purchasers pursuant to Rule 173 under the Securities Act) in connection with confirmation of sales of the Securities. The term "Preliminary Prospectus" means the preliminary prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Securities together with the Base Prospectus. If the Company has filed an abbreviated registration statement pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act (the "Rule 462 Registration Statement"), then any reference herein to the term "Registration Statement" shall be deemed to include such Rule 462 Registration Statement.  Any reference in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, Base Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act, as of the effective date of the Registration Statement or the date of such Base Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be and any reference to "amend", "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after such date under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act") that are deemed to be incorporated by reference therein.  Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.
Registration Statement
 
At or prior to the time when sales of the Securities were first made (the "Time of Sale"), the Company had prepared the following information (collectively with the information referred to in the next succeeding sentence, the "Time of Sale Information"): a Preliminary Prospectus dated July 20, 2009, and each "free-writing prospectus" (as defined pursuant to Rule 405 under the Securities Act) listed on Annex B hereto as constituting part of the Time of Sale Information.
 
2.             .  (a)  The Company agrees to issue and sell the Securities to the several Underwriters as provided in this Agreement, and each Underwriter, on the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements set forth herein and subject to the conditions set forth herein, agrees,
Purchase of the Securities by the Underwriters
severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company the respective principal amount of Securities set forth opposite such Underwriter's name in Schedule 1 hereto at a price equal to 99.231% of the principal amount of 2014 Notes and 99.041% of the principal amount of 2019 Notes, in each case plus accrued interest, if any, from July 27, 2009, to the Closing Date (as defined below).  The Company will not be obligated to deliver any of the Securities except upon payment for all the Securities to be purchased as provided herein.

The Global Note will be made available for inspection by the Representatives not later than 1:00 P.M., New York City time, on the business day prior to the Closing Date.
 
(e)           The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person.  Additionally, neither the Representatives nor any other Underwriter is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction.  The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.

Indemnification and Contribution
 
(a)             The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, (ii) or any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
Indemnification of the Underwriters.
 
(b)             Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the following:  The third paragraph of text under the caption "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus Supplement concerning the terms of offering, including the concession and reallowance to certain dealers, by the Underwriters; the third and fourth sentences of the seventh paragraph of text under the caption "Underwriting" in the Preliminary
Indemnification of the Company.
Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus Supplement relating to market making by the Underwriters; and the  eighth paragraph of text under the caption "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus Supplement relating to over-allotment, stabilization and syndicate covering transactions by the Underwriters.
 
(c)             If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a)  (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 7.  If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 7 that the Indemnifying Party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred.  In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.  It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC, BNP Paribas Securities Corp. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company.  The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled

with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.  No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
 
(d)             If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution.
 
(e)             The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above.  The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.

Termination
 
10.           .

contained in this Agreement.  If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms.  If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes.  As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.

(c)           If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters.  Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
 
(d)           Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
 
(e)           Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this Section 10, each series of Securities issued pursuant to the Indenture shall be treated as a separate
series, and this Section 10 shall apply to each series as if this Underwriting Agreement applied solely to such series.
 
11.

Schedule 1
 
Annex A-1
 
1.             The Registration Statement is an "automatic shelf registration statement" as defined under Rule 405 of the Securities Act that has been filed with the Commission not earlier than three years prior to the date of the Underwriting Agreement; each of the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus was filed with the Commission pursuant to the subparagraph of Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act specified in such opinion on the date specified therein; and no order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued, no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of such registration statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act has been received by the Company and no proceeding for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act against the Company or in connection with the offering is pending or, to the best knowledge of such counsel, threatened by the Commission.
 
2.             The Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus included in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and financial schedules and other financial data therein, as to which we express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act; and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act.
 
3.             The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
 
4.             The Securities have been duly authorized, executed, authenticated, issued and delivered and constitute valid and legally binding obligations of
the
Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture; and the Securities, and the Indenture conform to the descriptions thereof in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
 
5.             The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the parties thereto and constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument, enforceable in accordance with its terms, and the Indenture conforms in all material respects to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act applicable to an indenture that is qualified thereunder.
 
6.             No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any court or governmental agency or body is required for the issue and sale of the Securities or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, except such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders, registrations or qualifications as may be
required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters.
 
7.             The statements set forth in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and under the caption "Description of the Notes" and "Description of Debt Securities We May Offer," insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Securities, and under the caption "Underwriting" insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the laws and documents referred to therein, are accurate, complete and fair in all material respects; provided, however, that this opinion shall not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon or in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by the Underwriters through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus; and the statements in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus under the caption "Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences," insofar as such statements constitute a summary of the United States federal tax laws referred to therein, are accurate and fairly summarize in all material respects the United States federal tax laws referred to therein.
 
8.             The Company is not, and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, will not be, an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company", as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act.
 
9.             The documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and financial schedules and other financial data therein, as to which we express no opinion), when they were filed with the Commission complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and we have no reason to believe that any of such documents (other than the financial statements and financial schedules and other financial data therein, as to which we express no opinion), when they were so filed, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading.
 
Although we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus except for those referred to in paragraph 7 above, we have participated in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Time of the Sale Information and the Prospectus, including review and discussion of the contents thereof, and based upon and subject to the foregoing and the other qualifications and limitations set forth herein, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that: (i) any part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, (except for the financial statements and financial schedules and other financial data included therein and except for that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes
the Form T-1, as to which we express no belief) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, (ii) the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (except for the financial statements and financial schedules and other financial data included therein and except for that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Form T-1, as to which we express no belief) on the date of the Underwriting Agreement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, not misleading, (iii) the Time of Sale Information (except for the financial statements and financial schedules and other financial data included therein) at the Time of Sale contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or that the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto as of its date and the Closing Date contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
 
Insofar as our opinion relates to the enforceability under New York law of the provisions of the Transaction Documents choosing New York law as the governing law thereof, such opinion is rendered solely in reliance upon the Act of July 19, 1984, ch. 421, 1984 McKinney's Sess. Law of N.Y. 1406 (codified at N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law  5-1401 (McKinney 1989)) (the "Act") and is subject to the qualifications that such enforceability (i) as specified in the Act, does not apply to the extent provided to the contrary in subsection two of Section 1-105 of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, (ii) may be limited by public policy considerations of any jurisdiction in which enforcement of such provisions or enforcement of a judgment upon one or more of the Transaction Documents is sought, and (iii) is subject to any United States Constitutional requirement under the Full Faith and Credit Clause or the Due Process Clause thereof or the exercise of any applicable judicial discretion in favor of another jurisdiction.
 
We express no opinion with respect to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of New York, The General and Business Corporation Law of the State of Missouri and the federal laws of the United States.  Without limiting the foregoing sentence, we express no opinion concerning the securities or other laws of any jurisdiction outside the United States.
 
This opinion is furnished by us solely for your benefit in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and may not, without our prior written consent, be relied on by any other person.

4.             To the best of my knowledge and other than as set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus under the caption "Item 3 - Legal Proceedings", there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the general affairs, management, consolidated financial position, shareholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries or on the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities; and, to the best of my knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others.
 
5.             The issue and sale of the Securities and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to me to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company
is subject, except to the extent that any such breach, violation or default will not have a material adverse effect on the general affairs, management, consolidated financial position, shareholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, nor will such actions result in any violation of the provisions of the Restated Articles of Incorporation or Amended By-laws of the Company or any statute or any order, rule or regulation known to me of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties.
 
6.             The Company is not in violation of its Restated Articles of Incorporation or Amended By-laws and no subsidiary of the Company is in material violation of its Articles/Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws, and neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in default in the performance or observance of any obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease or other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound, except to the extent that any such default will not have a material adverse effect on the general affairs, management,  consolidated financial position, shareholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries.
 
7.             The statements set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus under the caption "Item 3  Legal Proceedings," insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the laws and documents referred to therein, are accurate, complete and fair in all material respects.
 
8.             I have no reason to believe that the documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and other financial data and related schedules therein, as to which I express no opinion), when they were filed with the Commission, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading.
 
Although I do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus except for those referred to in the opinion in paragraph 7 above,
I have participated in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Time of the Sale Information and the Prospectus, including review and discussion of the contents thereof, and based upon and subject to the foregoing and the other qualifications and limitations set forth herein, nothing has come to my attention that causes me to believe that: (i) any part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, (except for the financial statements and financial schedules and other financial data included therein and except for that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Form T-1, as to which I express no belief) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, (ii) the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (except for the financial statements and financial schedules and other financial data included therein and except for that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Form T-1, as to which I express no belief) on the date of the Underwriting Agreement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, (iii) the Time of Sale Information (except for the financial statements and financial schedules and other financial data included therein) at the Time of Sale contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or that the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto as of its date and the Closing Date  contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
 
This opinion is solely for your benefit and may not be relied upon in any manner by any other person other than you without my prior consent.
