Item 1.01         Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On July 29, 2009, Bemis Company, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a letter agreement (the "Amendment") with Alcan Corporation ("Alcan") and Pechiney Plastic Packaging, Inc. ("PPPI").  The Amendment amends that certain Sale and Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") dated July 5, 2009 that the Company entered into with Alcan and Alcan Holdings Switzerland AG ("AHS" and together with Alcan, the "Sellers") pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire the food packaging business and certain related assets of Sellers located in the United States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and New Zealand (the "Acquisition").  Prior to the Amendment, the Agreement also required the Company to enter into a commitment letter (the "Commitment Letter") pursuant to which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Bank of America, N.A. and BNP Paribas (collectively the "Commitment Parties") committed to provide up to $800 million under a 364-day unsecured bridge loan facility.
 
The Amendment reflects the receipt of proceeds (the "Proceeds") by the Company, before expenses, of approximately $200 million from the sale (the "Equity Offering") of 8,055,000 shares of Company common stock on July 28, 2009 and approximately $793 million from the sale (the "Debt Offering") of 5.65% Notes due 2014 and 6.80% Notes due 2019 on July 27, 2009.  Pursuant to the Amendment, the Company is permitted to terminate the Commitment Letter. 
In addition, the Amendment terminated the previously reported Share Purchase Agreement, dated July 5, 2009 (the "Equity Commitment Agreement"), between the Company and PPPI pursuant to which the Company had the option to pay up to $200 million of the purchase price of the Acquisition in common stock of the Company.  Consequently, the Company will not issue Company common stock to Sellers as partial consideration for the $1.213 billion Acquisition purchase price.  The Amendment also requires the Company to use the Proceeds, net of expenses, in partial payment of the purchase price of the Acquisition.
