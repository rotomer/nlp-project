Other Events.
 
On December 29, 2009, Bemis Company, Inc. issued a press release announcing that
it is involved in discussions with the staff of the Department of Justice regarding their review, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, of Bemis' pending acquisition of the Food Americas operations of Alcan Packaging, a business unit of international mining group Rio Tinto plc (LON: RIO; ASX: RIO).  These discussions include remedies which management believes would resolve the concerns expressed by the Department of Justice about the transaction.
 
Bemis previously indicated that it had anticipated receiving regulatory approval of the transaction by the end of 2009.  While discussions are progressing, management no longer anticipates that approval will be received by December 31, 2009.  It is now management's expectation that regulatory approval will be received in early 2010.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
