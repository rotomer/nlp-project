ITEM 2.02.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On January 28, 2010, Bemis Company, Inc. issued a press release containing its financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009, a copy of which is furnished as Exhibit 99 to this report.  Earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2010 for Bemis Company is included with this press release and will be available during the regular earnings release conference call scheduled for Thursday, January 28, 2010, at 10:00 a.m. (EDT). Individuals may listen to the call on the Internet at www.bemis.com under "Investor Relations."  Listeners are urged to check the website ahead of time to ensure their computers are configured for the audio stream.  Instructions for obtaining the required, free, downloadable software are available in a pre-event system test on the site.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The press release furnished as an exhibit to this report contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including:
 
                 
Segment operating profit as adjusted
 
                 
Segment operating profit as adjusted as a percentage of net sales
 
                 
Diluted earnings per share as adjusted
 
Each of these measures excludes from the most directly comparable GAAP measures the impact of certain items.  Management believes these adjusted measures are useful to investors because they assist an investor's understanding of the impact of these items on the comparability of the Company's operations from year-to-year.  Excluding the impact of these items also enables investors to compare our underlying operational results and trends before other charges and income items that are considered by management as not related to the Company's core operations.  Management uses these adjusted measures to monitor and evaluate operating performance and also for internal planning purposes.  These measures are subject to certain limitations because they do not reflect all charges, income, or other items that were actually recognized by the Company in accordance with GAAP.  As a result, investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP.  In addition, these adjusted measures may not be calculated in the same manner as adjusted measures presented by other companies.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
BEMIS COMPANY REPORTS 2009 FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR END RESULTS
Bemis Achieves Record Cash Flow from Operating Activities of $476 million for 2009
Flexible Packaging Segment Records Strong Operating Performance
 
NEENAH, WISCONSIN, January 28, 2010
 Bemis Company, Inc. (NYSE-BMS) today reported quarterly diluted earnings of $0.26 per share for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009, an 18.8 percent decrease compared to $0.32 per share for the fourth quarter of 2008.  Excluding the effect of acquisition related charges and financing expenses detailed in the attached schedule, "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Data," diluted earnings per share would have been $0.45 for the fourth quarter of 2009.  This result is at the top end of management's guidance of $0.40 to $0.45 per share and compares to $0.32 per share for the fourth quarter of 2008.  Diluted earnings per share for the full year 2009 were $1.40, a decrease of 13.0 percent from $1.61 per share reported in 2008.  Excluding the effect of acquisition related charges and financing expenses, severance charges, and a gain on the sale of an asset, diluted earnings per share would have been $1.86 in 2009.  This compares to management's most recent full year guidance of $1.81 to $1.86 per share and to actual results of $1.61 per share in 2008.
 
Commenting on the results of 2009, Henry Theisen, Bemis Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "I am pleased to report strong 2009 operating performance and a record $476 million of cash flow provided by operations.  Our emphasis on aggressive cost management, production efficiency, and working capital management achieved sustainable improvements throughout the business in 2009.  Our business teams around the world are developing unique solutions and creating growth opportunities for the future.  In 2010, we expect to benefit from the continued strength of our balance sheet, a wide array of recently introduced products, and a larger footprint with the anticipated completion of our Alcan Packaging Food Americas acquisition."
 
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
Net sales of $905.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 represented a 4.4 percent increase from $867.9 million for the same period of 2008.  Currency translation benefits increased net sales by 6.8 percent for the quarter.  The June 2009 acquisition of a packaging business in South America increased sales during the fourth quarter by 3.0 percent.
 
For the full year 2009, net sales were $3.5 billion, a decrease of 7.0 percent compared to net sales of $3.8 billion in 2008.  Currency effects decreased net sales by 3.3 percent in 2009, while a South American acquisition contributed 1.3 percent to net sales growth.
 
Quarterly diluted earnings per share were $0.26 for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009, an 18.8 percent decrease compared to $0.32 per share for the fourth quarter of 2008.  Excluding the effect of acquisition related charges and financing, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.45 for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $0.32 per share for the fourth quarter of 2008.  Earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2009 reflect a benefit from net foreign exchange gains and currency transaction impacts totaling $4.3 million before taxes, adding $0.03 per share to the results of the quarter.  Earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2008 were negatively impacted by volatile currency exchange rates resulting in net foreign exchange losses totaling $6.2 million before taxes or a decrease of $0.04 per share.
 
 
Diluted earnings per share for the full year 2009 were $1.40, a decrease of 13.0 percent from $1.61 per share reported in 2008.  Excluding the effect of acquisition related charges and financing expenses, severance charges, and a gain on the sale of an asset, diluted earnings per share would have been $1.86 in 2009 compared to $1.61 per share in 2008.
 
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Flexible Packaging
Flexible packaging, which represented about 85 percent of total Company net sales during the quarter, reported net sales of $770.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, an increase of 5.4 percent compared to net sales of $731.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2008.  Currency related effects increased flexible packaging net sales by 7.1 percent and a June 2009 acquisition increased net sales by 3.6 percent.  Unit sales volume and mix both had a positive impact on flexible packaging sales during the quarter, offset by lower selling prices which reflect generally lower input costs compared to 2008.  Segment operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $90.7 million, or 11.8 percent of net sales.  Segment operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $66.2 million, or 9.1 percent of net sales.  The effect of currency translation increased operating profit in the fourth quarter of 2009 by $3.5 million compared to the same quarter of 2008.  Operating profit improvement in the fourth quarter was driven by increased sales of higher value-added products and the ongoing benefits of Bemis' World Class Manufacturing initiatives.
 
For the total year ended 2009, flexible packaging net sales of $3.0 billion represented a 5.4 percent decrease compared to 2008.  Currency effects accounted for a sales decline of 3.3 percent compared to 2008 and an acquisition in 2009 increased net sales by 1.6 percent.  The remaining 3.7 percent decrease in net sales was driven by lower unit sales volume.  Operating profit increased to $390.4 million, or 13.1 percent of net sales, compared to $315.9 million, or 10.0 percent of net sales in 2008.  The net effect of currency translation reduced operating profit in 2009 by $8.6 million compared to 2008.  Improved operating profit reflects the combined impact of improved sales mix, production efficiency initiatives, and decreasing input costs during the first half of 2009.
 
Commenting on the results of this business segment, Theisen said, "I am pleased to report a record level of annual flexible packaging operating profit and the highest annual profit margins as a percentage of net sales since 2004. By expanding sales of our value-added products into new markets and across all geographic regions, and maintaining a persistent focus on production improvements using our World Class Manufacturing initiatives, we have created positive momentum in our business.  Our innovative new products address our customers' sustainable packaging initiatives and offer total system cost savings by reducing material content through the development of thinner, tougher films; extending shelf life; reducing waste; and improving line speeds in our customers' operations.  We look forward to further expanding our product portfolio in 2010 with additional flexible packaging products from the Alcan Packaging Food Americas acquisition."
 
Pressure Sensitive Materials
Fourth quarter net sales from the pressure sensitive materials business segment were $135.4 million, a decrease of 0.9 percent from net sales of $136.6 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Currency effects increased net sales by 5.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009.  This increase was more than offset by a 5.9 percent decrease in net sales primarily due to lower sales of graphics and technical products.  Segment operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $7.1 million, or 5.2 percent of net sales, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 when segment operating profit was $4.4 million or 3.2 percent of net sales.  The net effect of currency translation increased operating profit by $0.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the same period of 2008.
 
For the total year ended 2009, net sales of pressure sensitive materials were $531.2 million, a 15.2 percent decrease from net sales in 2008.  Currency effects accounted for a net sales decline of 3.2 percent.  Operating profit was $13.6 million or 2.6 percent of net sales in 2009.  This compares to operating profit of $34.3 million or 5.5 percent of net sales in 2008.  The net effect of currency translation decreased operating profit in 2009 by $0.8 million.  Lower net sales and operating profit in 2009 reflect lower unit sales volumes compared to 2008.
 
Commenting on the results for the segment, Theisen said, "We are encouraged to see improvement in our pressure sensitive materials segment operating profit levels this quarter, primarily reflecting the effectiveness of our 2009 cost management efforts combined with a modest recovery of unit sales volume in label products.  This business segment sells into markets that are sensitive to economic conditions.  Once the economic conditions in North America and Europe begin to strengthen, we expect operating performance in this business segment to improve."
 
Other Costs (Income), Net
For the fourth quarter of 2009, other costs and income included $5.1 million of financial income, a decrease of $2.8 million compared to $7.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2008.  Lower financial income reflects a decrease in interest income from reduced cash balances invested outside of the United States during 2009.  Cash balances in our Brazilian operations have been applied to debt repayment and to fund the acquisition of the South American rigid packaging operations of Huhtamaki Oyj in June of 2009.  Other costs and income also included $15.1 million of acquisition related expenses.
 
For the total year 2009, other costs and income included $20.2 million of financial income compared to $33.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, reflecting a decline in interest income from lower cash balances invested outside of the United States in 2009.  Financial income also includes fiscal incentives for certain flexible packaging locations which is considered part of flexible packaging operating profit.  Net foreign exchange gains totaled $1.4 million in 2009 compared to a net foreign exchange loss of $6.8 million in 2008.  Other costs and income for the year ended December 31, 2009 also included $44.8 million of acquisition related expenses and a gain of $3.6 million on the sale of property in Brazil.
 
Capital Structure
Total debt to total capitalization was 38.7 percent at December 31, 2009, compared to 31.5 percent at December 31, 2008.  Total debt as of December 31, 2009 was $1.3 billion, an increase of $572.2 million from the balance of $686.6 million at December 31, 2008.  This increase in debt reflects $800.0 million of public bonds issued in July 2009 associated with financing for the pending Alcan Packaging Food Americas acquisition, net of a reduction in commercial paper and other debt outstanding.  Excluding the $800.0 million of public bonds and $202.8 million of common stock issued for acquisition financing, total debt to total capitalization would have been 20.5 percent at December 31, 2009.
 
Liquidity
As of December 31, 2009, Bemis had available from its banks a $425.0 million revolving credit facility.  This credit facility is used principally as back-up for the Company's commercial paper program.  As of December 31, 2009, there was $116.2 million of debt outstanding supported by this credit facility, leaving $308.8 million of available credit.  Once the acquisition of the Alcan Packaging Food Americas business is complete, an amendment to the revolving credit facility will become effective, increasing credit available and therefore total commercial paper capacity from $425.0 million to $625.0 million.  Cash flows from operating activities are expected to continue to provide sufficient liquidity to meet future cash obligations.  Strong cash flows from operations totaling $475.8 million during 2009 were used for $250.5 million of net debt reduction; $89.2 million of capital expenditures; a $43.0 million acquisition of a South American rigid packaging operation; a $30.0 million tax-deductible, voluntary pension contribution; and dividend payments totaling $96.6 million.
 
Pending Acquisition of Alcan Packaging Food Americas
On July 5, 2009, Bemis announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Food Americas operations of Alcan Packaging, a business unit of international mining group Rio Tinto plc (LON: RIO; ASX: RIO), for $1.2 billion.  Pursuant to the agreement, Bemis will acquire 23 Food Americas flexible packaging facilities in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and New Zealand.  These facilities produce flexible packaging for the food and beverage industries.  The transaction is expected to be accretive to diluted GAAP earnings per share in the first twelve months after closing.  Bemis is currently involved in discussions with the staff of the Department of Justice in connection with its Hart-Scott-Rodino regulatory review.  These discussions include remedies which management believes would resolve the concerns expressed by the Department of Justice about the transaction.  The transaction is expected to be approved in the near future, and Bemis expects to complete the acquisition before the end of the first quarter.
 
2010 Earnings Outlook
Consistent with management's practice, guidance does not reflect the impact of severance charges, acquisition related costs, and interest expense or shares issued in connection with the pending acquisition of the Alcan Packaging Food Americas business.  Guidance also excludes any operating results of the planned Alcan Packaging Food Americas acquisition.  On this basis, management expects first quarter 2010 diluted earnings per share to be similar to the results of the first quarter of 2009.
 
Due to the anticipated first quarter closing of the pending Alcan Packaging Food Americas acquisition and the significant impact this acquisition will have on 2010 results of operations, management plans to announce annual guidance for earnings per share shortly after the completion of the acquisition.
 
Presentation of Non-GAAP Information
Some of the information presented in this press release reflects adjustments to "As reported" results to exclude certain amounts related to the sale of property in Brazil, the Company's workforce reductions, and the impact of acquisition related items.  This adjusted information should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).  It is provided solely to assist in an investor's understanding of the impact of these items on the comparability of the Company's operations.  A reconciliation of the GAAP amounts to the Non-GAAP amounts is included with this press release.
 
New Accounting Pronouncement
In June 2008, the FASB issued guidance now codified as ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share, which requires unvested share based payment awards that contain rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends (whether paid or unpaid) to be included in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share effective January 1, 2009.  Accordingly, the 2008 earnings per share for the quarter and the full year have been recast to reflect the impact of this new accounting guidance to present them on a comparable basis with 2009 results.  The impact of this modification is a $0.01 per share decrease in diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2008 and a $0.04 per share decrease in diluted earnings per share for the year ending December 31, 2008.
 
Forward Looking Statements
Statements in this release that are not historical, including statements relating to the expected future performance of the Company, are considered "forward-looking" and are presented pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Such content is subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risk that further discussions will not resolve areas of dispute between the Department of Justice and the parties to the transaction, resulting in an inability to complete the acquisition; additional costs and other consequences resulting from the inability to complete the transaction; unexpected costs associated with completing the acquisition; future changes in cost or availability of raw materials; consumer buying patterns under certain economic conditions; changes in customer order patterns; the results of competitive bid processes; costs associated with the pursuit of business combinations; a failure in our information technology infrastructure or applications; foreign currency fluctuations; changes in working
 
capital requirements; and the availability and related cost of financing from banks and capital markets.  Actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those projected in any such forward-looking statements depending on a variety of factors which are detailed in the Company's regular SEC filings including the most recently filed Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.
 
Further information concerning some of the factors that could cause materially different results is included in the Company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Such reports are available from the Securities and Exchange Commission's public reference facilities and its website, Bemis' investor relations department, and Bemis' website, www.bemis.com.
