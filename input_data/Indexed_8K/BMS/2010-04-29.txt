ITEM 2.02.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On April 29, 2010, Bemis Company, Inc. issued a press release containing its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2010, a copy of which is furnished as Exhibit 99 to this report.  Earnings guidance for the balance of 2010 for Bemis Company is included with this press release and will be available during the regular earnings release conference call scheduled for Thursday, April 29, 2010, at 10:00 a.m. (EDT). Individuals may listen to the call on the Internet at www.bemis.com under "Investor Relations."

Instructions for obtaining the required, free, downloadable software are available in a pre-event system test on the site.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The press release furnished as an exhibit to this report contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including:
 
                 
Segment operating profit as adjusted
 
                 
Segment operating profit as adjusted as a percentage of net sales
 
                 
Diluted earnings per share as adjusted
 
Each of these measures excludes from the most directly comparable GAAP measures the impact of certain items.  Management believes these adjusted measures are useful to investors because they assist an investor's understanding of the impact of these items on the comparability of the Company's operations from year-to-year.  Excluding the impact of these items also enables investors to compare our underlying operational results and trends before other charges and income items that are considered by management as not related to the Company's core operations.  Management uses these adjusted measures to monitor and evaluate operating performance and also for internal planning purposes.  These measures are subject to certain limitations because they do not reflect all charges, income, or other items that were actually recognized by the Company in accordance with GAAP.  As a result, investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP.  In addition, these adjusted measures may not be calculated in the same manner as adjusted measures presented by other companies.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
BEMIS COMPANY REPORTS 2010 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
 
NEENAH, WISCONSIN, April 29, 2010
 Bemis Company, Inc. (NYSE-BMS) today reported quarterly diluted earnings from continuing operations of $0.27 per share plus diluted earnings from discontinued operations of $0.01 per share for the first quarter ended March 31, 2010.  This compares to $0.36 per share for the same quarter of 2009.  Excluding the effect of acquisition-related charges, pre-acquisition financing impacts, and 2009 severance charges associated with workforce reductions, as detailed in the attached schedule, "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Data," diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as adjusted, would have been $0.48 for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $0.43 for the first quarter of 2009.
 
Total Bemis net sales were $1.0 billion for the first quarter of 2010, a 21.1 percent increase from $843.4 million for the same period of 2009.  Acquisitions completed during the last twelve months, including the recently acquired Alcan Packaging Food Americas business, increased first quarter net sales by an estimated 17 percent.  Currency effects increased net sales by 4.8 percent compared to the first quarter of 2009.
 
"With this acquisition completed, we are pleased to report our first billion dollar net sales quarter as we begin to integrate the Food Americas business with Bemis Company," said Henry Theisen, Bemis Company's President and Chief Executive Officer.  "The positive momentum we enjoyed in our higher value-added flexible packaging product lines during 2009 continued through the first quarter.  While increased raw material costs and competitive pressures have created a more challenging environment in early 2010, we are encouraged by the strength of our flexible packaging backlog and improvement in our pressure sensitive materials business.  The integration of the Food Americas business is well underway and cost savings synergies are ahead of schedule."
 
Acquisition of Alcan Packaging Food Americas business
 
On March 1, 2010, Bemis completed its acquisition of the Food Americas operations of Alcan Packaging, a business unit of Rio Tinto plc.  Under the terms of the $1.2 billion transaction, Bemis acquired 23 Food Americas flexible packaging facilities in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and New Zealand, which recorded 2009 net sales totaling $1.4 billion.  These facilities produce flexible packaging principally for the food and beverage industries and will augment Bemis' product offerings and technological capabilities.  Under the terms of an order signed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 25, 2010, a portion of the acquired business must be divested, which includes two facilities, located in Menasha, Wisconsin and Tulsa, Oklahoma.  This portion of the business is related specifically to sales of flexible packaging for retail natural cheese products and shrink bag packaging for fresh beef, veal, lamb, and pork products.  The 2009 annual net sales associated with the business to be sold were approximately $150 million.  Operating results associated with this business to be sold have been classified as discontinued operations.  The continuing operations of the Food Americas business, net of associated financing costs, reduced first quarter 2010 diluted earnings by $0.03 per share.  This includes purchase accounting charges for inventory and order backlog of $.07 per share, as detailed in the attached schedule, "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Data."
 
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
 
Flexible Packaging
 
Bemis' flexible packaging business segment reported net sales, excluding discontinued operations, of $881.4 million.  This represents a 23.2 percent increase compared to net sales of $715.2 million for the first quarter of 2009.  Acquired operations are quickly integrating, making it difficult to determine their exact impact on current results, but Bemis estimates that acquisitions increased net sales by approximately 20 percent during the quarter.  Currency effects increased net sales by 5.2 percent.  Segment operating profit for the first quarter of 2010 was $93.9 million, or 10.7 percent of net sales, compared to $91.4 million, or 12.8 percent of net sales, for the same period of 2009.  The Food Americas acquisition increased operating profit, after purchase accounting adjustments for inventory and order backlog, by $1.0 million during the quarter.  Segment operating profit as adjusted for the first quarter would have been $105.9 million, or 12.0 percent of net sales, in 2010 compared to $92.5 million, or 12.9 percent of net sales, in 2009.  (See attached schedule: "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Data.")  The effect of currency translation increased operating profit in the first quarter of 2010 by $4.0 million compared to the same quarter of 2009.  Raw material cost reductions in late 2008 and early 2009 provided a short-term benefit to profits in early 2009.  Widespread raw material cost increases that occurred during the first quarter of 2010 negatively impacted operating profit for the first quarter.
 
Commenting on the flexible packaging segment results, Theisen said, "We are working diligently to integrate the Food Americas business with Bemis at all levels, from safety to customer service to product development.  We intend to optimize our combined
operations and incorporate best practices from both Bemis and Food Americas to accelerate our growth profile, improve profitability, and maximize shareholder value.  We are very pleased with the manufacturing capacity and workforce talent that we have added to Bemis Company with this acquisition.
 
During the first quarter, we experienced the usual seasonal volume trends.  January and February were soft, followed by a strong March, which is often one of the strongest months of the year.  We continue to enjoy increasing sales volumes in areas of the business that focus on convenience and value-added packaging.  Positive momentum in these areas was offset by competitive pressures in more commodity-like packaging products.  In our European operations, while sales mix continues to improve, operating results were lower due to rapidly increasing raw material costs and soft sales volumes.  Our Latin American operations continue to perform well, and we are looking forward to the benefits of our newly acquired capacity."
 
Pressure Sensitive Materials
 
Net sales from the pressure sensitive materials business segment for the first quarter of 2010 were $140.3 million, a 9.4 percent increase compared to $128.2 million in the first quarter of 2009.  Currency effects increased net sales by 3.0 percent compared to the first quarter of 2009.  This segment reported operating profit for the first quarter of 2010 of $6.6 million, or 4.7 percent of net sales, compared to an operating loss during first quarter of 2009 of $1.9 million.  Results for the first quarter of 2009 were negatively impacted by severance charges associated with workforce reduction events intended to adjust workforce levels to better match soft volume trends.  Excluding the impact of these severance costs, segment operating profit for the first quarter of 2009 would have been $0.7 million, or 0.5 percent of net sales.  (See attached schedule: "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Data").  The effect of currency translation increased operating profit in the first quarter of 2010 by $0.3 million compared to the same quarter of 2009.
 
"Our pressure sensitive materials business is showing signs of recovery," said Theisen.  "Sales volumes in all product lines, in particular in the United States, have improved both sequentially and compared to the first quarter of 2009.  As economic conditions improve, we expect operating profit in this segment to increase and demand for higher margin graphic and technical products to accelerate."
 
Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net
 
For the first quarter of 2010, other operating income and expense included $3.7 million of fiscal incentive income, a decrease of $0.3 million compared to $4.0 million for the first quarter of 2009.  Fiscal incentives are associated with net sales and manufacturing activities in certain South American operations and are included in segment operating profit.  Other operating income and expense also included $12.7 million of professional fees associated with the acquisition of the Food Americas business, compared to $9.1 million of such fees for the same period of 2009.
 
Other Non-operating (Income) Expense, Net
 
For the first quarter of 2010, other non-operating income and expense included net foreign exchange gains totaled $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2010, primarily reflecting the impact of currency fluctuations on financing arrangements for the foreign operations acquired in the Food Americas acquisition.  These acquisition related foreign currency exposures were eliminated by March 31, 2010.
 
Capital Structure
 
Total debt to total capitalization was 44.1 percent at March 31, 2010, compared to 38.8 percent at December 31, 2009.  Total debt as of March 31, 2010 was $1.5 billion, an increase of $276.7 million from the balance of $1.3 billion at December 31, 2009.  This increase primarily reflects the financing needed to complete the March 1, 2010 acquisition of Food Americas.  The total $1.2 billion acquisition price was funded with $1.0 billion of cash raised in 2009 and a $228.0 million issuance of commercial paper.
 
Liquidity
 
As of March 31, 2010, Bemis had available from its banks a total of $625.0 million of revolving credit facilities.  These credit facilities are used principally as back-up for the Company's commercial paper program.  As of March 31, 2010, there was $388.5 million of debt outstanding supported by these credit facilities, leaving $236.5 million of available credit.  Cash used in operating activities was $1.4 million for the first quarter of 2010, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $148.3 million for the first quarter of 2009.  Working capital improvements created strong cash flow levels in the first quarter of 2009 reflecting the impact of lower raw material costs on inventory balances.  Working capital increased during the first quarter of 2010 reflecting higher accounts receivable balances due to strong March sales, as well as increasing raw material costs combined with the normal seasonal build up of inventory to meet strong customer demand for second quarter shipments.  Bemis also made a tax-deductible, voluntary pension contribution of $15 million during the first quarter of 2010.
 
Dividend Increase
 
During the first quarter of 2010, the board of directors approved a 2.2 percent increase in the quarterly dividend, from $0.225 per share to $0.23 per share.
 
2010 Outlook
 
Guidance for adjusted annual diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excludes the impact of acquisition financing costs for the first two months of 2010 before the acquisition was completed, which represented approximately $0.06 per share.  In addition, adjusted earnings per share guidance does not reflect the impact of severance charges, acquisition related professional and legal fees, or purchase accounting adjustments for inventory and order backlog, in each case incurred and yet to be incurred.
 
Management expects adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2010 to be in the range of $0.53 to $0.58.  Management expects adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full year
2010 to be in the range of $2.00 to $2.15 per share.  This is an increase from management's previous adjusted annual guidance of $1.95 to $2.10 per share, reflecting an accelerated rate of acquisition related cost savings synergies.  Including the needs of the recently acquired facilities, management now expects total Bemis capital expenditures in 2010 to be in the $160 million to $170 million range.  This spending level is well below depreciation and amortization expense, which is expected to be in the range of $210 million to $220 million in 2010.
 
Guidance for adjusted annual earnings per share from continuing operations for 2010 includes an estimated $30 million in pre-tax cost savings synergies, the majority of which are associated with elimination of duplicative administrative overhead costs.  Bemis continues to expect approximately $60 million of annual run-rate pre-tax synergies to be achieved by the end of 2011.  These improvements will be achieved primarily by optimizing product mix, improving operational and supply chain efficiencies, and reducing administrative costs.
 
Additional Acquisition Disclosure
 
Additional financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2010, and the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, including the continuing operations of the Alcan Packaging Food Americas business acquired from Rio Tinto, will be disclosed in the footnotes to Bemis' Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 and on Form 8-K/A, respectively, both of which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in early May.
 
Presentation of Non-GAAP Information
 
Guidance in this press release uses non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit as a percentage of net sales, and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations.  These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable.  These measures exclude the impact of certain amounts related to workforce reductions, acquisition related financing costs, acquisition related professional and legal fees, and purchase accounting adjustments for inventory and order backlog.  This adjusted information should not be construed as an alternative to results determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).  It is provided solely to assist in an investor's understanding of the impact of these items on the comparability of the Company's operations.

Such content is subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to future changes in cost or availability of raw materials, consumer buying patterns under certain economic conditions, changes in customer order patterns, the results of competitive bid processes, costs associated with the pursuit of business combinations, unexpected costs associated with integrating acquisitions, a failure in our information technology infrastructure or applications, foreign currency fluctuations, changes in working capital requirements, and the availability and related cost of financing from banks and capital markets.
