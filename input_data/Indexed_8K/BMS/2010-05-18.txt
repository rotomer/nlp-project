FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
BEMIS COMPANY ANNOUNCES INTENT TO ACQUIRE REMAINING SHARES OF ITS SOUTH AMERICAN SUBSIDIARY, DIXIE TOGA S.A.
 
NEENAH, WISCONSIN, May 14, 2010
 Bemis Company, Inc. (NYSE-BMS) today announced that its wholly owned Brazilian subsidiary intends to submit a tender offer for all outstanding publicly owned shares of Dixie Toga S.A.  Shares of Dixie Toga S.A. are traded on the So Paulo Stock Exchange ("BM&F Bovespa S.A.").  Additionally, an agreement has been reached with certain institutional non-voting preferred shareholders who have agreed to participate in the tender offer.
 
The total cost of the shares to be acquired in the tender offer, assuming all outstanding shares are tendered, is expected to range between $50 million and $55 million, based upon recent currency exchange rates.  The tender offer is subject to Brazilian regulatory procedures and there is no assurance that the tender offer will be completed successfully.  If successful, management expects these transactions to be completed during the third quarter of 2010.  These transactions are not expected to impact management's earnings guidance for 2010.
 
 
Further Information
 
This announcement is for information purposes only and does not constitute, and must not be construed as, an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities, pursuant to the tender offer or otherwise.  The tender offer is being made in accordance with the documents to be filed pursuant to Brazilian regulations.  Dixie Toga S.A. shareholders who accept the tender offer may rely only on such documentation for all the terms and conditions of the tender offer.

Such content is subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risk that fluctuations in currency rates could increase or decrease the costs of the tender offer; and the risk that the tender offer is not approved by the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission or the tender offer is not otherwise successfully completed.  Actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those projected in any such forward-looking statements depending on a variety of factors which are detailed in the Company's regular SEC filings including the most recently filed Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.
