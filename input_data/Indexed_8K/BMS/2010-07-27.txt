Earnings guidance for the balance of 2010 for Bemis Company is included with this press release and will be available during the regular earnings release conference call scheduled for Tuesday, July 27, 2010, at 10:00 a.m. (EDT).

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The press release furnished as an exhibit to this report contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including:
 
        Segment operating profit as adjusted
 
        Segment operating profit as adjusted as a percentage of net sales
 
        Diluted earnings per share as adjusted
 
Each of these measures excludes from the most directly comparable GAAP measures the impact of certain items.  Management believes these adjusted measures are useful to investors because they assist an investor's understanding of the impact of these items on the comparability of the Company's operations from year-to-year.  Excluding the impact of these items also enables investors to compare our underlying operational results and trends before other charges and income items that are considered by management as not related to the Company's core operations.  Management uses these adjusted measures to monitor and evaluate operating performance and also for internal planning purposes.  These measures are subject to certain limitations because they do not reflect all charges, income, or other items that were actually recognized by the Company in accordance with GAAP.  As a result, investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP.  In addition, these adjusted measures may not be calculated in the same manner as adjusted measures presented by other companies.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
BEMIS COMPANY REPORTS 2010 SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
Net Sales increase 47%;
Total Year 2010 Adjusted EPS Guidance increases to $2.10 - $2.20
 
NEENAH, WISCONSIN, July 27, 2010
 Bemis Company, Inc. (NYSE-BMS) today reported quarterly diluted earnings from continuing operations of $0.52 per share for the second quarter.  Excluding the effect of special charges, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as adjusted, would have been $0.58 for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $0.50 for the second quarter of 2009, a 16.0 percent increase.  Special charges include acquisition-related expenses and severance associated with workforce reductions as detailed in the attached schedule, "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Data."
 
Highlights of the second quarter:
 
                 
Record quarterly net sales of $1.3 billion included organic sales growth of 6.5 percent
                 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 16.0 percent driven by accretive acquisitions, World Class Manufacturing savings, and sales mix improvements
                 
Cash flow from operations increased 5.5 percent from the same period of 2009
                 
Total year adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance increased to $2.10 - $2.20 per share
 
"We are quickly realizing the benefits of our 2010 Food Americas acquisition," said Henry Theisen, Bemis Company's President and Chief Executive Officer.  "The integration of our newly acquired operations is progressing well and cost synergies continue to be realized at an accelerated pace.  Strong sales growth driven by increased unit volume and improved sales mix supported improved operating profit performance this quarter.  We have increased our outlook for total year results, reflecting our confidence in the current positive market trends and momentum in both acquisition integration and World Class Manufacturing improvements."
 
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Flexible Packaging
Flexible packaging business segment net sales increased 53.6 percent to $1.13 billion for the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period of 2009.  Bemis estimates that acquisitions increased net sales by approximately 45 percent during the quarter.  Currency effects increased net sales by 2.8 percent, driven primarily by the stronger Brazilian currency.  The remaining 5.8 percent growth in net sales reflects higher sales of value-added products and improved unit sales volume.
 
Flexible packaging operating profit for the second quarter of 2010 was $125.6 million, or 11.1 percent of net sales, compared to $102.3 million, or 13.9 percent of net sales, for the same period of 2009.  Flexible packaging operating profit, as adjusted, for the second quarter would have been $133.0 million, or 11.8 percent of net sales, in 2010 compared to $102.6 million, or 14.0 percent of net sales, in 2009.  (See attached schedule: "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Data.")  The effect of currency translation increased operating profit in the second quarter of 2010 by $2.2 million.  Raw material cost reductions in late 2008 and early 2009 provided a short-term benefit to profits in the first half of 2009.  Operating margins as a percentage of net sales in the second quarter of 2010 reflect the negative short-term effects of raw material cost increases in early 2010 and generally lower operating margins in the newly acquired Food Americas operations.  Management expects the ongoing benefit of increasing cost saving synergies to improve operating margins as acquisition integration efforts continue.
 
Pressure Sensitive Materials
Pressure sensitive materials net sales increased 7.8 percent to $143.2 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period of 2009.  Currency effects reduced net sales by 2.3 percent compared to the second quarter of 2009.  Healthy unit volume growth in both our European and North American operations and across all product lines offered substantial improvement over last year's weak market environment.
 
Pressure sensitive materials operating profit for the second quarter was $11.7 million, or 8.2 percent of net sales, compared to operating profit of $2.9 million, or 2.2 percent of net sales, for the same period of 2009.  The effect of currency translation reduced operating profit in the second quarter of 2010 by $0.3 million compared to the same quarter of 2009.  Higher sales of value-added graphic and technical products improved sales mix and increased operating profit as a percentage of net sales.
 
CONSOLIDATED ITEMS
Selling, general, and administrative expenses and interest expense were higher for the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same quarter of 2009 reflecting the impact of the Food Americas acquisition on March 1, 2010.
 
For the second quarter of 2010, other operating income and expense included $4.2 million of fiscal incentive income, an increase of $0.4 million compared to the second quarter of 2009.  Fiscal government incentives are associated with certain Brazilian operations and are included in flexible packaging segment operating profit.  Other operating income and expense also included $1.2 million of professional fees associated with the Food Americas acquisition, compared to $4.7 million of such fees for the same period of 2009.
 
Cash Flow
Cash provided by operating activities was $125.5 million for the second quarter of 2010, a 5.5 percent increase compared to the second quarter of 2009.  Available cash was used to reduce debt outstanding during the quarter by approximately $60 million.  On July 13, 2010, Bemis completed the sale of its discontinued operations for approximately $82 million.  Proceeds from the sale were used to further reduce debt outstanding during the third quarter of 2010.
 
Third Quarter and Full Year 2010 Outlook
"Healthy organic volume growth in value-added product lines, momentum in our World Class Manufacturing initiatives, and accelerated acquisition integration benefits have created positive trends for 2010," said Theisen, commenting on the revised guidance for 2010.  "Our business teams are diligently executing a growth strategy that maximizes the benefits of our newly combined resources.  Recovery in certain economically sensitive markets is encouraging, but cost management and acquisition integration efforts remain a priority in this environment."
 
Management expects adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2010 to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.60.  Management expects adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full year 2010 to be in the range of $2.10 to $2.20 per share.  This is an increase from management's previous adjusted annual guidance of $2.00 to $2.15 per share.  While capital spending is expected to accelerate in the second half of the year, guidance for 2010 capital expenditures has been reduced to approximately $140 million.  Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $210 million for 2010.
 
Guidance for adjusted annual diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excludes the impact of acquisition financing costs for the first two months of 2010 before the Food Americas acquisition was completed, which represented approximately $0.06 per share.  In addition, adjusted earnings per share guidance does not reflect the impact of severance charges, acquisition related professional and legal fees, or purchase accounting adjustments for inventory and order backlog.
 
Presentation of Non-GAAP Information
Guidance in this press release uses non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit as a percentage of net sales, and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations.  These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable.  These measures exclude the impact of certain amounts related to workforce reductions, acquisition related costs, and purchase accounting adjustments for inventory and order backlog.  This adjusted information should not be construed as an alternative to results determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).  It is provided solely to assist in an investor's understanding of the impact of these items on the comparability of the Company's operations.
