Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The press release furnished as an exhibit to this report contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including:
 
       
Segment operating profit as adjusted
 
       
Segment operating profit as adjusted as a percentage of net sales
 
       
Diluted earnings per share as adjusted
 
Each of these measures excludes from the most directly comparable GAAP measures the impact of certain items.  Management believes these adjusted measures are useful to investors because they assist an investor's understanding of the impact of these items on the comparability of the Company's operations from year-to-year.  Excluding the impact of these items also enables investors to compare our underlying operational results and trends before other charges and income items that are considered by management as not related to the Company's core operations.  Management uses these adjusted measures to monitor and evaluate operating performance and also for internal planning purposes.  These measures are subject to certain limitations because they do not reflect all charges, income, or other items that were actually recognized by the Company in accordance with GAAP.  As a result, investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP.  In addition, these adjusted measures may not be calculated in the same manner as adjusted measures presented by other companies.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
BEMIS COMPANY REPORTS 2011 SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
 
NEENAH, WISCONSIN, July 27, 2011
 Bemis Company, Inc. (NYSE-BMS) today reported its 2011 second quarter results:
 
Highlights of the second quarter 2011:
 
                 
Net sales increased by 8 percent to a record $1.4 billion.
                 
Diluted earnings per share was $0.51, in line with management's second quarter 2011 guidance of $0.48 to $0.54 per share.
                 
Flexible packaging segment operating profit continues to be negatively impacted by higher raw material costs in advance of selling price adjustments.
                 
Cash provided by operating activities totaled $91 million.
                 
Repurchases of Bemis common stock totaled 2.1 million shares.
                 
Management established earnings guidance for the third quarter of 2011 at $0.56 to $0.61 per share, and total year 2011 earnings guidance was lowered and narrowed to $2.08 to $2.18 per share, reflecting the total expected impact of softening demand and stabilizing raw material costs during the second half of the year.
 
"Results for the second quarter of 2011 were in line with our expectations," said Henry Theisen, Bemis Company's President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Profit margins were lower this quarter as a result of raw material cost inflation that continued through the month of May.  While North American sales volumes have been keeping pace with the levels of 2010, we continue to be cautious about expectations for the second half of 2011 in light of inflationary pressures on our operating margins and consumer spending levels.  Our guidance for the remainder of the year assumes stabilizing raw material costs during the second half of this year along with softening volume levels."
 
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
 
Total Bemis net sales were $1.4 billion for the second quarter of 2011, a 7.9 percent increase from $1.3 billion for the same period of 2010.  Sales growth included a 3.4 percent increase from currency translation.
 
Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2011 was $0.51 compared to adjusted diluted earnings from continuing operations of $0.58 per share ($0.52 per share GAAP diluted earnings from continuing operations, as detailed in the attached schedule, "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Data") reported in the same quarter of 2010. Performance for the second quarter of 2011 was negatively impacted by increases in the cost of specialty resin raw materials which continued through the first five months of 2011.
 
FLEXIBLE PACKAGING BUSINESS SEGMENT
 
Bemis' flexible packaging business segment reported net sales of $1.2 billion.  This represents an 8.1 percent increase compared to net sales of $1.1 billion for the second quarter of 2010.  Currency effects increased net sales by 3.0 percent.  The remaining sales growth reflected higher selling prices compared to the second quarter of 2010.  Segment operating profit for the second quarter of 2011 was $116.3 million, or 9.5 percent of net sales, compared to adjusted operating profit of $130.1 million, or 11.5 percent of net sales (Operating profit on a GAAP basis was $122.7 million, or 10.9 percent of net sales, as detailed in the attached schedule: "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Data"), for the same period of 2010.  The effect of currency translation increased operating profit in the second quarter of 2011 by $2.6 million compared to the same quarter of 2010.  Dramatic raw material cost increases that occurred during the first quarter of 2011 negatively impacted operating profit for the second quarter of 2011.
 
Commenting on the flexible packaging segment results, Theisen said, "As expected, raw material cost increases continued to negatively impact our operating profit this quarter in advance of selling price adjustments.  In addition, we experienced modestly
 
 
lower sales volumes toward the end of the second quarter compared to the strong volume levels that we generated during the same period of 2010.  Food price inflation has led to retail consumer price increases, which may negatively impact consumer demand for some packaged food products in the future.  In our Latin American business, while we are pleased to report improved operating performance in our Mexico operations, regional results are being negatively impacted by raw material cost increases, substantial inflation in Argentina, and lower customer demand levels as the strong Brazilian currency negatively impacts the market for our customers' exported products.  We expect third quarter selling price adjustments to improve profit levels that were negatively impacted by raw material cost increases that began late last year and started to stabilize in June.  We also expect continued commercialization of new products during the second half of 2011 to partially offset the impact of softer demand predicted by our customers."
 
PRESSURE SENSITIVE MATERIALS BUSINESS SEGMENT
 
Net sales from the pressure sensitive materials business segment for the second quarter of 2011 were $151.5 million, a 5.8 percent increase compared to $143.2 million in the second quarter of 2010.  Currency effects increased net sales by 5.7 percent.  For the second quarter of 2011, operating profit totaled $11.8 million, or 7.8 percent of net sales, compared to operating profit for the second quarter of 2010 of $11.7 million, or 8.2 percent of net sales.  Currency effects increased operating profit for the quarter by $0.8 million.
 
OTHER OPERATING (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET
 
For the second quarter of 2011, other operating income and expense included $5.4 million of fiscal incentive income, an increase of $1.2 million compared to $4.2 million for the second quarter of 2010.  Fiscal incentives are associated with net sales and manufacturing activities in certain South American operations and are included in flexible packaging segment operating profit.
 
CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND CASH FLOW
 
Total debt as of June 30, 2011 was $1.5 billion, an increase of $196 million from the balance of $1.3 billion at December 31, 2010.  Increased levels of working capital during the first half of 2011 reflect higher raw material costs in inventory and subsequently higher selling prices in accounts receivable.  During the six months ended June 30, 2011, Bemis purchased 3.8 million shares of Bemis common stock for $123.1 million.  The remaining share repurchase authorization as of June 30, 2011 was 5.7 million shares.
 
2011 EARNINGS OUTLOOK
 
Management expects adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2011 to be in the range of $0.56 to $0.61.  In light of the anticipated softening demand levels for the second half of 2011 and the assumption that raw material costs will remain relatively stable for the remainder of this year, management expects adjusted diluted earnings per share for the full year 2011 to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.18 per share.  Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $125 million for the full year 2011.
