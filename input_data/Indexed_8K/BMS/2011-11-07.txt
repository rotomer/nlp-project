Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
 
On November 3, 2011, the Board approved an amendment and restatement of the By-Laws of the Company (the "Amended By-Laws").  The Amended By-Laws became effective immediately upon adoption.   The Amended By-Laws require any shareholder proposing business or director nominees for consideration at shareholders meetings to disclose additional information regarding the shareholder's economic interests in the Company.  The Amended By-Laws also clarify that the role of Chairman of the Board is not itself an officer position, and that the positions of Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel are officer positions.
 
The Amended By-Laws are attached as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
