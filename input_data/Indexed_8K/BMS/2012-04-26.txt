ITEM 2.02.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On April 26, 2012, Bemis Company, Inc. issued a press release containing its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2012, a copy of which is furnished as Exhibit 99 to this report.  Earnings guidance for the balance of 2012 for Bemis Company, Inc. is included with this press release and will be available during the regular earnings release conference call scheduled for Thursday, April 26, 2012, at 10:00 a.m. (ET). Individuals may listen to the call on the Internet at www.bemis.com under "Investor Relations."

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The press release furnished as an exhibit to this report contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including:
 
        Segment operating profit as adjusted
 
        Segment operating profit as adjusted as a percentage of net sales
 
        Diluted earnings per share as adjusted
 
        Net debt to adjusted EBITDA
 
Each of these measures excludes from the most directly comparable GAAP measures the impact of certain items.  Management believes these adjusted measures are useful to investors because they assist an investor's understanding of the impact of these items on the comparability of the Company's operations from year-to-year.  Excluding the impact of these items also enables investors to compare our underlying operational results and trends before other charges and income items that are considered by management as not related to the Company's core operations.  Management uses these adjusted measures to monitor and evaluate operating performance and also for internal planning purposes.  These measures are subject to certain limitations because they do not reflect all charges, income, or other items that were actually recognized by the Company in accordance with GAAP.  As a result, investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP.  In addition, these adjusted measures may not be calculated in the same manner as adjusted measures presented by other companies.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
BEMIS COMPANY REPORTS 2012 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
 
NEENAH, WISCONSIN, April 26, 2012
 Bemis Company, Inc. (NYSE:BMS) today reported quarterly diluted earnings of $0.42 per share for the first quarter ended March 31, 2012.  Diluted earnings per share would have been $0.49 for the first quarter of 2012, excluding the effect of facility consolidation and acquisition-related integration charges detailed in the attached schedule, "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Data."
 
Highlights of the first quarter 2012:
 
                 
Net sales totaled $1.3 billion.
                 
Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 17.7 percent, the highest quarterly rate since 2010.
                 
Adjusted diluted earnings was $0.49 per share, an increase of 4.3 percent from the first quarter of 2011 and at the upper end of management's guidance of $0.43 to $0.49 per share.
                 
Facility consolidation charges totaled $8.3 million.
                 
Cash flow generated from operating activities totaled $48.8 million compared to a use of cash during the first quarter of 2011.
                 
Bemis' quarterly dividend increased by 4.2 percent, from $0.24 per share to $0.25 per share.
                 
Management established earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2012 in the range of $0.51 to $0.57 per share, and confirmed total year 2012 earnings guidance in the range of $2.05 to $2.20 per share.
 
"I am pleased to report that operating performance is improving, cash flow is healthy, and our facility consolidation activities are progressing as planned," said Henry Theisen, Bemis Company's President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Unit sales volumes continue to be soft, reflecting weaker consumer demand in light of current economic conditions.  Our full year guidance assumes volume growth during the second half of 2012."
 
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
 
Total Bemis net sales for the first quarter of 2012 was $1.3 billion, a 1.5 percent decrease from the same period of 2011, reflecting the impact of lower unit volume in the flexible packaging business segment.  Acquisitions completed during the second half of 2011 increased first quarter net sales by an estimated 1.6 percent.  The impact of currency translation reduced net sales by 1.6 percent.
 
Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2012 was $0.42 compared to $0.47 per share reported in the same quarter of 2011.  Excluding the effect of acquisition-related integration costs and facility consolidation costs, as detailed in the attached schedule, "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Data," diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, would have been $0.49 for the first quarter of 2012.
 
FACILITY CONSOLIDATION
 
During the fourth quarter of 2011, Bemis initiated a facility consolidation program to improve efficiencies and reduce fixed costs.  As a part of this program, Bemis announced the planned closure of five facilities and the intent to move most of the production from these facilities to other Bemis operations.  These facility consolidation activities are expected to save approximately $40 million in annualized costs beginning in 2013.
 
Highlights of the facility consolidation program:
 
                 
Total facility consolidation program cost is expected to be $83 million
 
                 
$38.4 million expensed in 2011 ($26.3 million of employee costs; $12.1 million of fixed asset-related expenses)
                 
$8.3 million expensed in the first quarter of 2012 ($1.2 million of employee costs; $7.1 million of fixed asset-related expenses)
 
                 
Most of the remaining charges are expected to occur during 2012
 
                 
Total cash paid for the program is expected to be approximately $52 million
 
                 
$3.3 million paid in the fourth quarter of 2011
                 
$8.0 million paid in the first quarter of 2012
                 
$24 million expected to be paid during the remainder of 2012
                 
Remaining cash expenditures are expected to be paid in 2013
 
FLEXIBLE PACKAGING BUSINESS SEGMENT
 
Net sales for Bemis' flexible packaging business segment decreased 1.7 percent to $1.2 billion compared to the first quarter of 2011.  The impact of currency translation reduced net sales by 1.5 percent compared to the previous year.  Bemis estimates that acquisitions completed during the second half of 2011 increased net sales by 1.8 percent.  The remaining reduction in sales principally represents the negative impact of lower unit sales volumes.  Segment operating profit for the first quarter of 2012 was $107.9 million, or 9.3 percent of net sales, compared to $116.3 million, or 9.9 percent of net sales, for the same period of 2011.  During the first quarter of 2012, acquisition-related integration costs and facility consolidation costs negatively impacted results.  Segment operating profit, as adjusted, for the first quarter of 2012 would have been $117.9 million, or 10.2 percent of net sales.  (See attached schedule: "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Data.")  The effect of currency translation decreased operating profit in the first quarter of 2012 by $1.3 million compared to the same quarter of 2011.  Performance for the quarter reflects the benefits of cost reductions partially offset by the negative impact of lower unit sales volumes.
 
Commenting on the flexible packaging segment results, Theisen said, "Performance in this segment reflects the positive impact of a manageable raw material cost environment and diligent cost management during the first quarter.  While we benefit from our exposure to a diverse range of packaging applications, some of which continue to demonstrate volume growth, overall unit sales volume has declined.  These volume levels are consistent with the experience of our customers and reflect the negative impact of weak economic conditions and inflation on consumer demand.  Raw material costs increased during the first quarter, which will put some pressure on second quarter results. We have been modifying customer pricing agreement terms to accelerate our ability to adjust selling prices on a more timely basis in 2012 and reduce the impact of raw material cost changes.  We expect volume to continue to be weak through the first half of this year and to strengthen during the second half of 2012."
 
PRESSURE SENSITIVE MATERIALS BUSINESS SEGMENT
 
Pressure sensitive materials net sales for the first quarter of 2012 were $145.3 million compared to $145.0 million in the first quarter of 2011.  The increase in net sales reflects the impact of increased sales of higher value products, partially offset by a negative impact from currency translation of 2.1 percent.  For the first quarter of 2012, operating profit was $9.7 million, or 6.7 percent of net sales, compared to operating profit for the first quarter of 2011 of $9.9 million, or 6.8 percent of net sales.  The impact of currency translation was insignificant to quarterly operating profit.
 
OTHER OPERATING (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET
 
For the first quarter of 2012, other operating income and expense included $5.2 million of fiscal incentive income, compared to $5.5 million for the first quarter of 2011.  Fiscal incentives are associated with net sales and manufacturing activities in certain South American operations and are included in flexible packaging segment operating profit.
 
CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND CASH FLOW
 
Net debt (defined as total debt less cash) to adjusted EBITDA (defined as, for the last twelve month period, adjusted operating income plus depreciation and amortization) was 2.3 times at March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011.  Cash flow from operations for the first quarter of 2012 of $48.8 million supported capital expenditures of $23.7 million and common stock dividends of $26.1 million.  Management intends to direct excess cash flow toward debt reduction in 2012 in order to reduce the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA toward a target of approximately 2.0 times.
 
2012 EARNINGS OUTLOOK
 
Commenting on the outlook for the rest of the year, Theisen said, "This year, we are focused on initiatives that we expect to improve our operating performance and returns on invested capital. While we generally experience seasonally stronger volumes during the second quarter of the year, we expect unit sales volumes during the first half of 2012 to continue to be sluggish compared to 2011.  Our full year guidance anticipates improved volumes during the second half of the year as our customers' initiatives gain momentum."
 
Management expects adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2012 to be in the range of $0.51 to $0.57.  Management expects adjusted diluted earnings per share for the full year 2012 to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.20 per share.  Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $175 million for the full year 2012.
