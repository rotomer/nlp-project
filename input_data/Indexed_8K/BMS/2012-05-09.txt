Item 1.01               Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On May 7, 2012, Bemis Company, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an amendment to its Second Amended and Restated Long-Term Credit Agreement ("Credit Agreement") dated July 21, 2011 among the Company, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Syndication Agent, and various financial institutions.  The definition of Consolidated Net Worth was amended to exclude increases or decreases arising from changes in the cumulative translation adjustment, thus largely eliminating the effect of the volatility of foreign currencies on the consolidated net worth calculation.  There were no other material changes to the terms or covenants in the Credit Agreement.  A copy of the amendment is furnished as Exhibit 10 to this report.
