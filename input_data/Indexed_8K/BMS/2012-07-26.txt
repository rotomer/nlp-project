ITEM 2.02.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On July 26, 2012, Bemis Company, Inc. issued a press release containing its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2012, a copy of which is furnished as Exhibit 99 to this report.  Earnings guidance for the balance of 2012 for Bemis Company, Inc. is included with this press release and will be available during the regular earnings release conference call scheduled for Thursday, July 26, 2012, at 10:00 a.m. (ET). Individuals may listen to the call on the Internet at www.bemis.com under "Investor Relations."  Listeners are urged to check the website ahead of time to ensure their computers are configured for the audio stream.  Instructions for obtaining the required, free, downloadable software are available in a pre-event system test on the site.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The press release furnished as an exhibit to this report contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including:
 
        Segment operating profit as adjusted
 
        Segment operating profit as adjusted as a percentage of net sales
 
        Diluted earnings per share as adjusted
 
        Net debt to adjusted EBITDA
 
Each of these measures excludes from the most directly comparable GAAP measures the impact of certain items.  Management believes these adjusted measures are useful to investors because they assist an investor's understanding of the impact of these items on the comparability of the Company's operations from year-to-year.  Excluding the impact of these items also enables investors to compare our underlying operational results and trends before other charges and income items that are considered by management as not related to the Company's core operations.  Management uses these adjusted measures to monitor and evaluate operating performance and also for internal planning purposes.  These measures are subject to certain limitations because they do not reflect all charges, income, or other items that were actually recognized by the Company in accordance with GAAP.  As a result, investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP.  In addition, these adjusted measures may not be calculated in the same manner as adjusted measures presented by other companies.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
BEMIS COMPANY REPORTS 2012 SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
 
NEENAH, WISCONSIN, July 26, 2012
 Bemis Company, Inc. (NYSE:BMS) today reported diluted earnings of $0.40 per share for the second quarter ended June 30, 2012.  Diluted earnings per share would have been $0.54 for the second quarter of 2012, excluding the effect of facility consolidation and acquisition-related integration charges detailed in the attached schedule, "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Data."
 
Highlights of the second quarter 2012:
 
                 
Net sales totaled $1.3 billion.
                 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.54 increased 5.9 percent from the second quarter of 2011 and was in line with management's second quarter guidance of $0.51 to $0.57 per share.
                 
Bemis expanded its facility consolidation program, which is now expected to generate approximately $50 million in annualized cost savings.
                 
Cash flow generated from operating activities increased to $94.5 million.
                 
Management revised guidance for the second half of the year:
 
                 
Adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2012 in the range of $0.51 to $0.57
                 
Total year 2012 adjusted earnings per share guidance in the range of $2.00 to $2.10
                 
Total year 2012 capital spending of approximately $150 million
 
"In this challenging year, we continue to focus on prudent cost management and efficient implementation of our facility consolidation program," said Henry Theisen, Bemis Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. "A favorable raw material cost environment is expected to mitigate some of the negative effects of lower volume levels in 2012.  Significant foreign currency changes have also negatively impacted translation of foreign profits.  Our ongoing improvements in cost structure will position us well to deliver performance improvement once volume begins to strengthen."
 
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
 
Total Bemis net sales for the second quarter of 2012 was $1.3 billion, a 4.2 percent decrease from the same period of 2011, reflecting the impact of lower unit volume in the flexible packaging business segment.  Acquisitions completed during the second half of 2011 increased second quarter net sales by an estimated 1.5 percent.  The impact of currency translation reduced net sales by 4.8 percent.
 
Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2012 was $0.40 compared to $0.51 per share in the same quarter of 2011.  Excluding the effect of acquisition-related integration costs and facility consolidation costs, as detailed in the attached schedule, "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Data," diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, would have been $0.54 for the second quarter of 2012.
 
FACILITY CONSOLIDATION
 
During the second quarter of 2012, Bemis continued to implement its previously announced facility consolidation program.  In addition, Bemis expanded the program to include four additional locations, including three facilities outside of the United States. The objective of Bemis' facility consolidation program is to improve efficiencies and reduce fixed costs.  This facility consolidation program is expected to save approximately $50 million in annualized costs beginning in 2013.
 
Highlights of the facility consolidation program:
 
                 
Total estimated program cost is expanded to $141 million
 
                 
$38.4 million expensed in 2011 ($26.3 million of employee costs; $12.1 million of fixed asset-related expenses)
                 
$8.3 million expensed in the first quarter of 2012 ($1.2 million of employee costs; $7.1 million of fixed asset-related expenses)
                 
$19.7 million expensed in the second quarter of 2012 ($14.0 million of employee costs; $5.7 million of fixed asset-related expenses)
                 
Most of the remaining charges are expected to occur during the second half of 2012, with about $20 million expected to move into early 2013.
 
                 
Total expected cash paid for the program has been revised to approximately $96 million
 
                 
$3.3 million paid in 2011
                 
$8.0 million paid in the first quarter of 2012
                 
$4.5 million paid in the second quarter of 2012
                 
$51 million expected to be paid during the remainder of 2012
                 
Remaining cash expenditures are expected to be paid in 2013
 
FLEXIBLE PACKAGING BUSINESS SEGMENT
 
Net sales of Bemis' flexible packaging business segment was $1.2 billion, a 3.9 percent decrease from the same period of 2011. The impact of currency translation reduced net sales by 4.8 percent compared to the previous year, primarily reflecting the weaker Brazilian currency.  Bemis estimates that acquisitions completed during the second half of 2011 increased 2012 net sales by 1.7 percent.  The remaining modest reduction in sales represents the negative impact of lower unit sales volumes offset by higher selling prices and improved sales mix.
 
Segment operating profit for the second quarter of 2012 was $96.3 million, or 8.2 percent of net sales, compared to $116.3 million, or 9.5 percent of net sales, for the same period of 2011.  Facility consolidation program and acquisition-related integration costs negatively impacted results during the second quarter of 2012.  Excluding these costs, segment operating profit, as adjusted, would have been $117.7 million, or 10.1 percent of net sales.  (See attached schedule: "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Data.")  The effect of currency translation decreased operating profit in the second quarter of 2012 by $4.2 million compared to the same quarter of 2011.  Performance for the quarter reflects the benefits of prudent cost management and improvements in price/mix, partially offset by the negative impact of lower unit sales volumes.
Commenting on the flexible packaging segment results, Theisen said, "Performance in the second quarter was as expected, with the negative effects of soft volume levels more than offset by increased pricing and improved sales mix.  We enjoyed modest volume growth in our high barrier food and medical product applications, but overall volume levels declined due to generally lower sales volumes in less complex product areas.  Our facility consolidation program aims to reduce costs and support our focus on high value-added packaging."
 
PRESSURE SENSITIVE MATERIALS BUSINESS SEGMENT
 
Pressure sensitive materials net sales for the second quarter of 2012 were $141.9 million, down 6.3 percent compared to $151.5 million in the second quarter of 2011.  The decrease in net sales reflects the impact of lower sales volumes in addition to a negative impact from currency translation of 5.0 percent.  Currency translation in this business segment is primarily related to the Euro.  For the second quarter of 2012, operating profit was $10.9 million, or 7.7 percent of net sales, compared to operating profit for the second quarter of 2011 of $11.8 million, or 7.8 percent of net sales.  The effect of currency translation decreased operating profit in the second quarter of 2012 by $0.8 million compared to the same quarter of 2011.
 
OTHER OPERATING (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET
 
For the second quarter of 2012, other operating income and expense included $4.4 million of fiscal incentive income, compared to $5.4 million for the second quarter of 2011.  Fiscal incentives are associated with net sales and manufacturing activities in certain South American operations and are included in flexible packaging segment operating profit.
 
CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND CASH FLOW
 
Net debt (defined as total debt less cash) to adjusted EBITDA (defined as, for the last twelve month period, adjusted operating income plus depreciation and amortization) was 2.3 times at June 30, 2012.  Cash provided by operating activities for the second quarter of 2012 was $94.5 million after the payment of $23.5 million of pension contributions.  These contributions maintain the current funded status of the U.S. pension plans above 90 percent.  Management intends to direct future excess cash flow toward debt reduction during 2012 in order to reduce the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA toward a target of approximately 2.0 times.
 
2012 EARNINGS OUTLOOK
 
Commenting on the outlook for the rest of the year, Theisen said, "We have lowered our expectation for sales volumes for the remainder of the year and adjusted guidance to reflect both lower volumes and weaker foreign currency exchange rates.  We are executing our facility consolidation program to effectively deliver measurable savings in 2013 and meet our objectives for performance improvement.  Our 2012 capital expenditure plan supports our key high barrier product growth initiatives in China, Brazil, and North America, but we have reduced our expected investments in other areas in light of current volume trends."
 
Management expects adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2012 to be in the range of $0.51 to $0.57.  Management expects adjusted diluted earnings per share for the full year 2012 to be in the range of $2.00 to $2.10 per share.  Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $150 million for the full year 2012, a reduction from management's previous guidance of $175 million.
