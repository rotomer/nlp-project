EXHIBIT 99.1
        (NEW YORK, July 22, 2003)Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) reported today that it has recently initiated an internal review of certain of its sales and marketing practices. The company's review focuses on whether these practices comply with the provisions of applicable "anti-kickback" laws. The internal review also includes a review of the company's compliance with "Best Price" requirements under the Medicaid program, and seeks to determine whether Medicaid rebates and pricing under certain other U.S. governmental programs which reference the Medicaid rebate program have been appropriate.
        Bristol-Myers Squibb is committed to compliance of its sales and marketing practices with all applicable requirements. The company has made considerable efforts to create a more open environment for communications and flow of information. The company's initiation of the internal review is consistent with that commitment and those ongoing efforts.
        Because the internal review is still in process, the company cannot predict its outcome. Accordingly, the company cannot reasonably assess the impact, if any, of these matters on its business or reasonably estimate the amount of any possible loss or range of loss with respect to these matters, which could include the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties and administrative remedies and/or liability for additional rebate amounts, or whether any such impact or loss could be material.
        Bristol-Myers Squibb is a global pharmaceutical and related health care products company whose mission is to extend and enhance human life.
