        (NEW YORK, July 24, 2003)Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) today reported net earnings of $878 million on sales of $5.1 billion for the second quarter of 2003. Fully diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $.45.
        "Company sales and earnings this quarter were boosted by the early success of ABILIFY, as well as increased sales domestically and internationally of our key growth drivers PLAVIX and PRAVACHOL," said Peter R. Dolan, chairman and chief executive officer. "The quarter was also marked by several milestones that will help the company build towards the future."
        "We received approvals for REYATAZ, a new protease inhibitor for treatment of HIV/AIDS, as well as PRAVIGARD PAC, a new co-pack combination of PRAVACHOL and buffered aspirin. We also recently submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for ABILIFY for the treatment of acute mania in patients with bipolar disorder.
        "As we look towards the remainder of 2003, we remain confident about the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for ERBITUX. We will also begin to initiate plans that are essential for steering us through future challenges and opportunities to build long term shareholder value. To that end, we understand the importance of the dividend to our investors and will seek to make it a priority while at the same time making important investments in our future."
SECOND QUARTER RESULTS:
 - 
The company reported that second quarter 2003 net sales increased 22% to $5.1 billion from $4.1 billion in the prior year. This sales increase resulted from a 17% increase in volume, a 4% increase in foreign exchange, and a 1% increase in price. Domestic sales increased 23% for the quarter. This increase for the quarter is the result of continued strong prescription demand for key brands and the impact from the workdown of non-consignment wholesaler inventory in the second quarter of 2002. International sales increased 21%, including an 11% favorable foreign exchange impact.
 - 
Second quarter 2003 earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes increased 61% to $1,165 million from $724 million in 2002, primarily as a result of higher sales. Net earnings from continuing operations increased 83% to $878 million in 2003 compared to $479 million in 2002. The effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes decreased to 21.3% in 2003 from 28.9% in 2002. Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations each increased 80% to $.45 in 2003 from $.25 in 2002. Basic and diluted average shares outstanding for the quarter were 1,937 million and 1,942 million, respectively, in 2003 compared to 1,937 million and 1,944 million, respectively, in 2002.
 - 
The company continues to increase promotional support of new and in-line products, with marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increasing 13% to $1,058 million and advertising and product promotion increasing 21% to $418 million. Research and development expenses increased 1% to $530 million.
 - 
In the second quarter of 2003, the company recorded certain items that affected the comparability of results. Those non-comparable items include $24 million of pre-tax income related to adjustments of prior period restructuring reserves, $25 million of charges related to the rationalization of manufacturing facilities, and $4 million related to relocation expenses. The charges related to the rationalization of its manufacturing facilities include $13 million related to termination benefits for workforce reductions in the Pharmaceutical segment and downsizing and streamlining of worldwide manufacturing operations, $10 million of accelerated depreciation for certain manufacturing facilities in North America expected to be closed by the end of 2006, and $2 million for asset impairments and retention benefits. In addition, the company recorded $11 million of income related to the revision of estimates for certain divestiture liabilities. The company also reported $57 million of pre-tax income from a litigation settlement and the reimbursement of patent defense costs partially offset by $16 million of litigation expenses related to TAXOL and BUSPAR settlement charges.
SIX MONTHS RESULTS
 - 
Net sales for the first six months of 2003 increased 11% to $9.8 billion from $8.8 billion in the first six months of 2002. This sales increase resulted from a 5% increase in volume, a 4% increase in foreign exchange, and a 2% increase in price. Domestic sales increased 7% and international sales increased 18%, including a 10% favorable foreign exchange impact. For the first six months of 2003, $287 million of deferred revenue was reversed and recognized as sales (calculated net of discounts and rebates). The deferred revenue, recorded at gross invoice sales prices, related to the inventory of pharmaceutical products accounted for using the consignment model, was reduced to $110 million at June 30, 2003, compared to $470 million at December 31, 2002.
 - 
During the six months ended June 30, 2003, the company's effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes was reduced from 27.8% to 24.2%, due to a revised estimate of the use of foreign tax credits relating mainly to the final implementation of the reorganization of the ownership structure of its non-U.S. subsidiaries. The principal purpose of the reorganization was to facilitate the company's ability to efficiently deploy its financial resources outside the U.S.
 - 
For the six months in 2003 and 2002, certain items were recorded which affect the comparability of the results. The 2003 non-comparable items include $51 million of pre-tax charges related to the rationalization of manufacturing facilities, $24 million of pre-tax income related to adjustments of prior period restructuring reserves, $4 million related to relocation expenses, and $62 million of pre-tax income from litigation settlements and the reimbursement of patent
defense costs. The charges related to manufacturing and rationalization activities include $25 million related to termination benefits for workforce reductions in the Pharmaceutical segment and downsizing and streamlining of worldwide manufacturing operations, $14 million for accelerated depreciation for facilities expected to be closed by the end of 2006, $11 million for asset impairments, and $1 million of retention benefits. The total cost of these rationalization expenses for 2003 is expected to be approximately $95 million, which reflects an increase from previous estimates due to the acceleration of the closure of certain manufacturing facilities. Of this amount, $51 million has been recorded as described above and $44 million is expected to be incurred in the second half of this year. In addition, the company recorded $11 million of income related to the revision of estimates for certain divestiture liabilities. The 2002 non-comparable items include a pre-tax litigation charge of $90 million primarily related to BUSPAR proposed settlements, a pre-tax in-process research and development charge of $160 million related to the revised agreement with ImClone Systems, Inc., and a gain on sale of product lines of $30 million. In addition, in the first quarter of 2002 the company recorded a $14 million after-tax gain in discontinued operations on the sale of its Clairol business as a result of the final purchase price settlement.
 - 
For the six months, earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes increased 15% to $2,240 million from $1,952 million in 2002. The increase was primarily a result of the sales increase, partially offset by an unfavorable product mix, increased investment in advertising and promotion, and an increase in sales force expenses. Net earnings from continuing operations increased 24% to $1,639 million in 2003 compared to $1,321 million in 2002. The effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes decreased to 24.2% in 2003 from 27.8% in 2002. Basic earnings per share from continuing operations increased 25% to $.85 in 2003 from $.68 in 2002. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 24% to $.84 in 2003 from $.68 in 2002. Basic and diluted average shares outstanding for the six months were 1,936 million and 1,941 million, respectively, in 2003 compared to 1,936 million and 1,946 million, respectively, in 2002.

 - 
Recorded alliance revenue for ABILIFY for the quarter was $65 million. The schizophrenia agent was introduced in the U.S. in November 2002 and has achieved more than a 5% weekly new prescription share of the U.S. antipsychotic market. The company also submitted a sNDA for ABILIFY for the treatment of acute mania in patients with bipolar disorder. ABILIFY is being developed and marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and its partner Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
 - 
Worldwide sales of PRAVACHOL, a cholesterol-lowering agent and the company's largest selling product, increased 56%, including a 10% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $698 million. In June 2003, the FDA approved PRAVIGARD PAC (Buffered Aspirin and Pravastatin Sodium) tablets.

AVAPRO and PLAVIX are cardiovascular products that were launched from the alliance between Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi-Synthelabo.
 - 
TAXOL and PARAPLATIN, the company's leading anti-cancer agents, had sales of $248 million and $247 million, respectively. International sales of TAXOL increased 27%, including favorable foreign exchange of 17%, to $223 million, led by strong sales growth in Japan, while domestic sales decreased 52% to $25 million due to generic competition. PARAPLATIN sales increased by 44% driven by sales in the U.S.
 - 
Sales by Oncology Therapeutics Network, a specialty distributor of anti-cancer medicines and related products, increased 21% to $558 million.
 - 
Sales of SUSTIVA, an anti-retroviral for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, were $160 million, an increase of 44% over the prior year.
 - 
The FDA granted marketing clearance for REYATAZ, a novel protease inhibitor for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. REYATAZ is the first once-daily protease inhibitor approved by the FDA.

Nutritionals and Other Healthcare
 - 
Nutritional sales of $436 million declined by 7%, including a 1% unfavorable foreign exchange impact, from prior year levels, as international sales increased 11%, including a 4% unfavorable foreign exchange impact, and U.S. sales decreased 22%. During the quarter, a $60 million charge to sales was recorded related to rebates issued under the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program to reflect a change in accounting for such rebates. The company now accrues for rebates expected to be issued at the date of revenue recognition, rather than at the date the WIC coupons are issued. Mead Johnson continues to be the leader in the U.S. infant formula market. Sales of ENFAMIL, the company's largest-selling infant formula, declined 23% to $150 million.
 - 
Sales for the Other Healthcare segment increased 11%, including a 6% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $424 million. ConvaTec sales increased 15%, including a 10% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $204 million. Medical Imaging sales increased 10% to $129 million. The increase in Medical Imaging sales was primarily the result of a 12% increase in sales of CARDIOLITE to $86 million. Consumer Medicines sales increased 3% as a result of favorable foreign exchange.
Outlook
        The company reiterated previously issued 2003 earnings guidance of between $1.60-$1.65 in non-GAAP earnings per share which excludes non-comparable items. Taking into account non-comparable items to date and $44 million in restructuring charges expected to be taken later this year, in each case as described above, under "six months results", earnings per share guidance on a GAAP basis would be $1.59 to $1.64. These numbers exclude the future impact of any write-off of any in-process research and development that may arise from any existing or future research and development arrangements and any other possible non-comparable items that may occur later this year including any possible restructuring or other charges, as described below. The company is not currently able to estimate the timing or magnitude of any such amounts.
        The company expects to have both growth opportunities and continued exclusivity challenges over the next several years. During this period, exclusivity losses are expected to amount in each year to approximately $1 billion dollars per year in net sales. The company expects these exclusivity losses will be offset by growth in revenues resulting from growth of the company's in-line products, including PLAVIX, AVAPRO and SUSTIVA, growth of recently launched exclusive products, ABILIFY and REYATAZ, and by the introduction of late stage pipeline products that may be approved within the next six to thirty-six months such as ERBITUX, CTLA4-Ig and Entecavir. After the impact of the loss of exclusivity of PRAVACHOL in the U.S., the company will have several years of minimal exclusivity loss impact. External development and licensing will remain important elements of the company's strategy, but the potential impact is not built in the company's plans.
        The company also expects profit challenges that include changes in product mix, as many of the company's products losing exclusivity carry higher margins than the company's in-line products that are expected to grow sales. Other profit challenges include, adequately investing in marketing and sales spend to support the company's in-line products and new product launches, the company's maturing pipeline opportunities and research and development.
        The company has historically reviewed and will continue to review its cost base. Decisions that may be taken as a result of these reviews may result in restructuring or other charges later this year or in future periods. At this time, the company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges, if any.
        The company is committed to establishing leadership through focus on therapy areas characterized by significant medical opportunity, where the company can bring to bear its particular expertise and establish leadership positions.
        Actual results may differ materially from the expectations described above. Some of the factors that could affect these expectations are described below in the "statement on cautionary factors."
