Global sales of key brands including PLAVIX, PRAVACHOL, AVAPRO/AVALIDE, and PARAPLATIN continue to grow
        (NEW YORK, October 23, 2003)Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) today reported net earnings of $884 million on sales of $5.3 billion for the third quarter of 2003. Fully diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $.45. Excluding non-comparable items described below, non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $.47.
        "In the quarter, we continued to see solid performance of our key pharmaceutical brands, including PRAVACHOL, PLAVIX and AVAPRO, all of which grew at double-digit rates," said Peter R. Dolan, chairman and chief executive officer. "Growth in the quarter was broad-based across geographies and across the portfolio, with U.S. and international pharmaceuticalsalong with ConvaTec, Mead Johnson Nutritionals and Medical Imagingall posting double digit sales gains.
        "As a result of this performance, we are increasing our EPS guidance for 2003. The company still remains cautious about its earnings outlook for the next few years due to the challenges of significant pharmaceutical exclusivity losses beginning in 2004, the need to invest behind new product launches, and profit margin pressure arising from changes in product mix. On the positive side, we are optimistic about ABILIFY and REYATAZ, the two new drugs launched in the last 12 months and we are hopeful about ERBITUX, the novel anticancer compound we are developing with ImClone Systems, Inc. that is now under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Next year, we expect to submit up to three new drug filings, as we continue to accelerate and further invest in our promising late stage drug pipeline."
THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
 - 
The company reported that third quarter 2003 net sales increased 18% to $5.3 billion from $4.5 billion in the prior year. This sales increase resulted from a 13% increase in volume, a 4% increase in foreign exchange, and a 1% increase in price. Domestic sales increased 16% for the quarter. This increase for the quarter is the result of continued strong prescription demand for key brands and the impact from the workdown of non-consignment wholesaler inventory in the third quarter of 2002. International sales increased 20%, including a 10% favorable foreign exchange impact.
 - 
Third quarter 2003 earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes increased to $1,292 million from $115 million in 2002 primarily as a result of higher sales and charges recorded in 2002 for litigation settlement and asset impairment. Net earnings from continuing operations increased 161% to $884 million in 2003 compared to $339 million in 2002. The effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes was 24.5% in 2003 compared to an income tax benefit in 2002. This income tax benefit recorded in 2002 was primarily due to the settlement of prior year tax matters. Basic earnings per share from continuing operations increased 156% to $.46 in 2003 from $.18 in 2002. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 165% to $.45 in 2003 from $.17 in 2002. Basic and diluted average shares outstanding for the quarter were 1,937 million and 1,944 million, respectively, in 2003 compared to 1,936 million and 1,941 million, respectively, in 2002.
 - 
The company continues to increase promotional support of new and in-line products, with marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increasing 15% to $1,118 million and advertising and product promotion increasing 24% to $375 million. Research and development expenses increased 6% to $568 million.
 - 
In the third quarter of 2003 and 2002, the company recorded restructuring, litigation, research and development income or expense items that affected the comparability of the results. Those items in 2003 include $31 million of pre-tax charges related to the downsizing and streamlining of worldwide operations, $7 million of pre-tax charges related to relocation expenses, and $3 million of pre-tax income related to adjustments of prior year restructuring reserves. The charges related to the downsizing and streamlining of worldwide operations include $9 million related to termination benefits for workforce reductions in the Other Healthcare and Pharmaceutical segments due to the rationalization of worldwide operations in Europe, North America and Central America, $21 million of accelerated depreciation for certain manufacturing facilities in North America expected to be closed by the end of 2006, and $1 million of retention benefits. In addition, the company recorded $21 million related to the upfront payments for two licensing agreements. The company also reported pre-tax income of $4 million from litigation settlements and $1 million for a milestone payment received related to a developmental project sold in previous years. The 2002 items include a pre-tax litigation charge of $569 million, primarily related to BUSPAR and TAXOL proposed settlements, a $379 million pre-tax charge for asset impairment for ImClone Systems, Inc., and $28 million of pre-tax income related to adjustments of prior period restructuring reserves. The company also recorded an income tax benefit of $235 million related to the settlement of certain prior year tax matters and the expected settlement of ongoing tax litigation. In addition, in the third quarter of 2002 the company recorded a $18 million after-tax gain in discontinued operations on the sale of its Clairol business as a result of lower than expected post-closing costs.
NINE MONTHS RESULTS
 - 
Net sales for the first nine months of 2003 increased 13% to $15.1 billion from $13.3 billion in the first nine months of 2002. This sales increase resulted from a 7% increase in volume, a 4% increase in foreign exchange, and 2% increase from pricing. Domestic sales increased 10% and international sales increased 19%, including a 10% favorable foreign exchange impact. For the first nine months of 2003, $311 million of deferred revenue was reversed and recognized as sales (calculated net of discounts and rebates). The deferred revenue, recorded at gross invoice sales prices, related to the inventory of pharmaceutical products accounted for using the consignment model, was reduced to $83 million at September 30, 2003, compared to $470 million at December 31, 2002.
 - 
For the nine months, earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes increased 71% to $3,532 million from $2,067 million in 2002. The increase was primarily a result of the sales increase and charges recorded in 2002 for litigation settlement, asset impairment, and in-process research and development, partially offset by increased investment in advertising and promotion, and an increase in marketing, selling and administrative expenses. Net earnings from continuing operations increased 52% to $2,523 million in 2003 compared to $1,660 million in 2002. The effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes increased to 24.3% in 2003 from 14.0% in 2002 due to an income tax benefit recorded in 2002 due to the settlement of prior year tax matters. Basic earnings per share from continuing operations increased 51% to $1.30 in 2003 from $.86 in 2002. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 53% to $1.30 in 2003 from $.85 in 2002. Basic and diluted average shares outstanding for the nine months were 1,936 million and 1,942 million, respectively, in 2003 compared to 1,936 million and 1,943 million, respectively, in 2002.
 - 
For the nine months in 2003 and 2002, the company recorded restructuring, litigation, and research and development income or expense items that affect the comparability of the results. The 2003 items include $82 million of pre-tax charges related to the rationalization of manufacturing facilities and administrative functions, $27 million of pre-tax income related to adjustments of prior period restructuring reserves, $11 million of pre-tax charges related to relocation expenses, and $66 million of pre-tax income from litigation settlements and the reimbursement of patent defense costs. The charges related to manufacturing and rationalization activities include $34 million related to termination benefits for workforce reductions in the Pharmaceutical and Other Healthcare segments and downsizing and streamlining of worldwide manufacturing and administrative operations, $35 million for accelerated depreciation for facilities expected to be closed by the end of 2006, $11 million for asset impairments, and $2 million of retention benefits. The total cost of these rationalization expenses for 2003 is expected to be approximately $104 million, which reflects an increase from previous estimates due to the rationalization of worldwide manufacturing and administrative operations. Of this amount, $82 million has been recorded as described above and $22 million is expected to be incurred in the fourth quarter of this year. In addition, the company recorded $11 million of pre-tax income related to the revision of estimates for certain divestiture liabilities and $1 million for a milestone payment received related to a developmental project sold in previous years. The company also recorded a $21 million charge related to the upfront payments for two licensing agreements. The 2002 items include a pre-tax litigation charge of $659 million primarily related to BUSPAR and TAXOL proposed settlements, a $379 million pre-tax charge for asset impairment for ImClone Systems, Inc., a pre-tax in-process research and development charge of $160 million related to the revised agreement with ImClone Systems, Inc., a gain on sale of product lines of $30 million, and $25 million of pre-tax income related to adjustments of prior period restructuring reserves. The company also recorded an income tax benefit of $235 million related to the settlement of certain prior year tax matters and the expected settlement of ongoing tax litigation. In addition, the company recorded after-tax gains in discontinued operations on the sale of its Clairol business of $18 million in the third quarter and $14 million in the first quarter as a result of lower than expected post-closing costs and the final purchase price settlement, respectively.

Outlook
        With a stronger than expected third quarter, the company now expects full year 2003 results to exceed our previous guidance of $1.60-$1.65 non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share. However, the company does not expect the fourth quarter to be as strong as the third quarter due primarily to the expected impact of higher research and development spending and the impact of exclusivity losses for SERZONE, MONOPRIL and GLUCOPHAGE XR in the U.S. and TAXOL in Europe. The timing of these exclusivity losses will have a direct impact on our 2003 fourth quarter earnings. The company's current estimate for 2003 non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share excluding non-comparable items is between $1.68-$1.73. Taking into account non-comparable items to date and $22 million in restructuring charges expected to be taken later this year, in each case as described above under "nine months results," and the $45 million fourth quarter up-front licensing payment to Corgentech Inc., fully diluted earnings per share guidance on a GAAP basis would be $1.65 to $1.70. These numbers exclude the future impact of any write-off of any in-process research and development that may arise from any existing or future research and development arrangements and any other possible non-comparable items that may occur later this year including any possible restructuring, resolution of legal proceedings or other charges as described below. The company is not currently able to estimate the timing or magnitude of any such amounts.
        As the company discussed previously, it expects to have both growth opportunities and continued exclusivity challenges over the next several years. During this period, exclusivity losses are expected to amount in each year to approximately $1 billion dollars per year in net sales. The company expects these exclusivity losses will be more or less offset by growth in revenues resulting from growth of the company's in-line products, including PLAVIX, AVAPRO and SUSTIVA, growth of recently launched exclusive products, ABILIFY and REYATAZ, and by the introduction of late stage pipeline products
that may be approved within the next six to thirty-six months such as ERBITUX, CTLA4Ig, entecavir and muraglitazar. Additionally, OTN sales growth is expected to continue. The company expects the resulting product mix to pressure company margins because the products losing exclusivity carry higher margins than products expected to grow sales.
        The company has historically reviewed and will continue to review its cost base. Decisions that may be taken as a result of these reviews may result in additional restructuring or other charges later this year or in future periods. At this time, the company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges, if any. At the same time the company expects to continue to invest behind in-line products and its research and development pipeline, particularly late stage products. External development and licensing will remain important elements of the company's strategy, but the potential impact is not built in the company's plans.
        At this time, the company does not expect the stronger than expected third quarter performance to continue in 2004. The company currently expects to provide 2004 guidance by the time of the release of 2003 fourth quarter results.
        The company and its subsidiaries are the subject of a number of significant pending lawsuits, claims, proceedings and investigations. For a discussion of these matters and their potential impact on the company, please see the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2003.
        Actual results may differ materially from the expectations described above. Some of the factors that could affect these expectations are described below in the "statement on cautionary factors."
