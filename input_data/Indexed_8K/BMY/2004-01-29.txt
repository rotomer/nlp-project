(NEW YORK, January 29, 2004)  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) today reported net earnings of $429 million on sales of $5.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2003. Fully diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $.22. Excluding specified items described below, fully diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter were $.37.  Net earnings for the full year 2003 were $2,952 million on sales of $20.7 billion.  Fully diluted earnings per share for the full year were $1.51.  Excluding specified items described below, fully diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis for the full year were $1.68.
 
"This was a strong quarter and a strong year for Bristol-Myers Squibb, building on robust momentum achieved throughout 2003," said Peter R. Dolan, chairman and chief executive officer.  "Growth of 20% or more for key products like PLAVIX, PRAVACHOL, AVAPRO/AVALIDE and SUSTIVA  along with better than expected uptakes on our newer products like ABILIFY and REYATAZ  contributed greatly to our solid performance."
 
"Looking ahead, we are hopeful about the application for approval of ERBITUX.  We are moving quickly to implement our new strategy, focusing on high-potential disease areas and placing greater emphasis on specialists and high value primary care prescribers, and continuing to grow R&D and investments behind
growth brands.  This strategy will also enable us to transition through the next few years of exclusivity losses and emerge in a stronger leadership position.  While we expect exclusivity losses and new product mix to challenge our margins, we remain committed to investing behind our businesses to maximize our key growth drivers and to advancing our promising pipeline, which includes up to three Phase III compounds that we hope to file in the next 12 to 15 months."
 
 
FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
 
The Company reported that fourth quarter 2003 net sales increased 16% to $5.6 billion from $4.8 billion in the prior year. This increase in net sales resulted from a 12% increase in volume, and a 4% benefit of foreign exchange. U.S. net sales increased 15% for the quarter. This increase for the quarter is the result of continued strong prescription demand for key brands and new product introductions. International net sales increased 18%, including an 11% favorable foreign exchange impact.

Fourth quarter 2003 earnings from continuing operations before minority interestand income taxes increased 36% to $831 million from $612 million in 2002, primarily as a result of higher sales of key pharmaceutical products. Net earnings from continuing operations increased 15% to $429 million in 2003 compared to $374 million in 2002. The effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes was 33.3% in fourth quarter 2003 compared to 25.7% in 2002, due to litigation charges recorded in 2003, partially offset by the implementation of tax planning strategies in 2002. In 2003, both basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 16% to $.22 from $.19 in 2002.  Basic and diluted average shares outstanding for the quarter were 1,937 million and 1,973 million, respectively, in 2003 compared to 1,935 million and 1,940 million, respectively, in 2002.
 - 
     
 
Also in the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company changed its method of recognizing revenue for certain sales from date of shipment to the date the products are received by customers to conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  Sales and gross margin for affected shipments were approximately $96 million and $63 million, respectively, at September 30, 2003.
 - 
     
 
The Company continued to invest behind the growth of the business.  Promotional support of new and in-line products grew, with marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increasing 15% to $1,289 million and advertising and product promotion increasing 19% to $464 million. Research and development expenses increased 8% to $714 million.
 - 
     
 
In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company established reserves for liabilities in connection with certain pending governmental investigations and civil litigation in the total amount of $225 million, comprised of  $125 million in relation to wholesaler inventory issues and certain other accounting matters, and $100 million in relation to pharmaceutical pricing and sales and marketing practices.   These investigations and litigations are described in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for Third Quarter of 2003.  It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the final outcome of these investigations or litigations.  In accordance with GAAP, the Company has determined that the above amounts represent minimum expected probable losses with respect to these groups of matters.  Eventual losses related to these matters may exceed these reserves, and the further impact of either one of these groups of matters could be material. Management continues to believe, as previously disclosed, that during the next few years, the aggregate impact, beyond current reserves, of these
 - 
     
and other legal matters affecting the Company is reasonably likely to be material to the Company's results of operations and cash flow, and may be material to its financial condition and liquidity.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded income and expense items comprised of  restructuring, litigation, and research and development, that affected the comparability of the results. The specified items in 2003 include $225 million of pre-tax charges for reserves relating to legal matters as set forth above, $81 million of pre-tax charges related to the initial payments for two licensing agreements, $37 million of pre-tax charges related to the downsizing and streamlining of worldwide operations, and $17 million of pre-tax charges primarily from other litigation settlements, partially offset by $10 million of pre-tax income related to adjustments of prior year restructuring reserves, and an income tax benefit on the above items of $40 million. The charges related to the downsizing and streamlining of worldwide operations include $19 million primarily related to termination benefits for workforce reductions in the Other Healthcare and Pharmaceutical segments due to the rationalization of worldwide operations in Europe, North America and Central America, and $18 million of accelerated depreciation for certain manufacturing facilities in North America expected to be closed by the end of 2006.  The specified 2002 items include primarily pre-tax restructuring and other charges of $95 million.
 - 
     
 
Results for the fourth quarter of 2003 include net pre-tax charges of $60 million to correct accounting errors related to prior periods.  This amount represents charges of $87 million, offset by credits of $27 million.
 - 
     
 
The charges are comprised of $84 million of increases in marketing, selling and administrative expenses and a $3 million increase to cost of products sold.  These charges primarily relate to corrections of the Company's historical accounting policies to conform the accounting to GAAP in areas in which the Company believed the impact of its previous practices were immaterial and, to a lesser extent, correction of errors in the application of GAAP.
 
The credits are comprised of a $13 million decrease to marketing, selling and administrative expenses, and a $14 million increase to other income. These credits primarily relate to correction of errors in the Company's prior period accounting due to a failure to timely adjust miscellaneous accounts, such as accruals, to required amounts.
 
The larger items were charges of $67 million to marketing, selling and administrative expenses related to certain international employee benefit plans primarily to reflect a change from the cash to the accrual basis of accounting, and $19 million to marketing, selling and administrative expenses related to employee vacation expenses to reflect a change from the cash to the accrual basis of accounting. There were a number of smaller charges and credits.
 
As discussed under full year results, the Company is evaluating the cumulative effect of these and other charges and adjustments taken during the year to correct accounting errors.
 
In addition, a portion of the Company's income tax provision of $277 million for the fourth quarter of 2003 reflects amounts attributable to prior periods.  The Company is in the process of identifying the portion of that provision which reflects correction of earlier accounting errors.
 
Also, the Company has reviewed account classifications as appropriate and made certain reclassifications in prior year financial statements to conform to current year presentation.
FULL YEAR RESULTS
 
Net sales for the full year 2003 increased 14% to $20.7 billion from $18.1 billion for the full year 2002. This increase in net sales resulted from a 9% increase in volume, a 4% benefit of  foreign exchange, and a 1% increase from pricing. U.S. net sales increased 12% and international net sales increased 18%, including a 10% favorable foreign exchange impact. At December 31, 2002, the Company recorded deferred revenue totaling $470 million for pharmaceutical products accounted for using the consignment model.  During the year 2003, the Company recognized $321 million of the previously deferred revenue (net of discounts,  rebates and other adjustments totaling $73 million) which reduced the deferred revenue amount to $76 million at December 31, 2003.  Deferred revenue for non-pharmaceutical products comprised $64 million of the $76 million recorded under the consignment model at December 31, 2003.
 - 
     
 
For the full year, earnings from continuing operations before minority interestand income taxes increased 61% to $4,471 million from $2,774 million in 2002. The increase was primarily a result of the sales increase and specified charges of $1,207 million recorded in 2002 for litigation settlements, asset impairment, and in-process research and development.  This increase was partially offset by increased investment in advertising and promotion, and in marketing, selling and administrative expenses. Net earnings from continuing operations increased 45% to $2,952 million in 2003 compared to $2,034 million in 2002. The effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes increased to 26.2% in 2003 from 17.4% in 2002 due primarily to litigation charges recorded in 2003, partially offset by the implementation of tax planning strategies in 2002, which resulted in the reduction of taxes in certain jurisdictions, and an income tax benefit recorded in 2002 for the settlement of prior year tax matters. In 2003, basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 45% and 44%, to $1.52 and $1.51, respectively, from $1.05 and $1.05 in 2002, respectively.  Basic and diluted average shares outstanding for the full year were 1,937 million and 1,950 million, respectively, in 2003 compared to 1,936 million and 1,942 million, respectively, in 2002.
 - 
     
 
In the full year 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded income and expense items comprised of restructuring, litigation, and research and development that affected the comparability of the results. The specified items in 2003 include $225 million of pre-tax charges for reserves relating to legal matters as set forth above in the Fourth Quarter Results, $119 million of pre-tax charges related to the rationalization of manufacturing facilities and administrative functions, $102 million of pre-tax charges related to the upfront payments for four licensing agreements and $13 million of pre-tax charges related to a specific restructuring initiative, partially offset by $51 million of pre-tax income from other litigation settlements and the reimbursement of patent defense costs, $37 million of pre-tax income related to adjustments of prior period restructuring reserves and $12 million of pre-tax income primarily related to the revision of estimates for certain divestiture liabilities, and an income tax benefit on the above items of $32 million. The charges related to manufacturing and rationalization activities include $53 million primarily related to termination benefits for workforce reductions in the Pharmaceutical and Other Healthcare segments and downsizing and streamlining of worldwide manufacturing and administrative operations, $53 million for accelerated depreciation for facilities expected to be closed by the end of 2006, $11 million for asset impairments, and $2 million of retention benefits. The specified items in 2002 include a pre-tax litigation charge of $659 million primarily related to BUSPAR and TAXOL proposed settlements, a $379 million pre-tax charge for asset impairment for ImClone Systems, Incorporated (ImClone), a pre-tax in-process research and development charge of $169 million primarily related to the revised agreement with ImClone, and pre-tax restructuring and other charges of $68 million, partially offset by a pre-tax gain on sale of product lines of $30 million. The Company also recorded an income tax benefit of $235
 - 
     
million related to the settlement of certain prior year tax matters and the expected settlement of ongoing tax litigation. In addition, the Company recorded after-tax gains in discontinued operations on the sale of its Clairol business of $32 million as a result of lower than expected post-closing costs and the final purchase price settlement.
 
The Company has continued its efforts to improve financial controls and reporting following its restatement of financial results last year.  In  2003, prior to the fourth quarter, the Company recorded certain charges and adjustments to correct prior period errors, the larger of which have been previously disclosed.  With the additional items described under Fourth Quarter Results, the Company is evaluating the cumulative impact of these charges and adjustments.
 - 
     
 
In aggregate, in 2003, the Company recorded net pre-tax charges of $97 million to correct accounting errors related to prior periods.  This amount represents charges of $199 million and credits of $102 million.
 
The charges are comprised of a $65 million decrease to net sales, $125 million of increases in marketing, selling and administrative expenses, $3 million of increases in cost of products sold, and a $6 million increase to other expenses.  These charges primarily relate to corrections of the Company's historical accounting policies to conform the accounting to GAAP in areas in which the Company believed the impact of its previous practices were immaterial and, to a lesser extent, relate to correction of errors in the application of GAAP.  The Company recorded these pre-tax charges of $67 million in the second quarter of 2003, $45 million in the third quarter of 2003 and $87 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 to correct prior period errors.
 
The credits are comprised of a $24 million  decrease to marketing, selling and administrative expenses, and a $78 million increase to other income.  These credits primarily relate to correction of errors in the Company's prior period accounting due to a failure to timely adjust miscellaneous accounts, such as accruals, to required amounts.  The Company recorded  pre-tax credits of $15 million in the first quarter of 2003, $48 million in the second quarter of 2003, $12 million in the third quarter of 2003 and $27 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 to correct prior period errors.
 
The larger items of those described above were charges of $67 million to marketing, selling and administrative expenses related to certain international employee benefits plans primarily to reflect a change from the cash to the accrual basis of accounting, $65 million to net sales for rebates issued under the Women Infants and Children (WIC) Program which the Company now accounts for by accruing rebates expected to be issued at the date of revenue recognition, rather than the date the WIC coupons are issued,  $29 million to marketing, selling and administrative expenses to correct prior year intercompany balances and $19 million to marketing, selling and administrative expenses related to employee vacation expenses to reflect a change from the cash to the accrual basis of accounting.
 
In addition to these pre-tax matters, the Company recorded a charge to equity income from affiliates of $48 million in the third quarter of 2003 to adjust deferred tax net assets related to tax attributes of certain partnership entities in which Sanofi Synthelabo (Sanofi) owns the majority controlling interest.  Further, a portion of the Company's income tax provision of $1,173 million for 2003 reflects amounts attributable to prior years.  The Company is in the process of identifying the portion of that provision which reflects correction of earlier accounting errors.
 
Also, the Company has reviewed account classifications as appropriate and made certain reclassifications in prior year financial statements to conform to current year presentation.
Prior to filing of its audited 2003 results, the Company will evaluate, individually and in aggregate, the charges and adjustments in 2003 (including the tax provision) which reflect correction of prior period accounting errors.  The Company will determine whether these charges and adjustments should continue to be reflected in 2003 results or whether prior year results should be restated to reflect these items.

The Company has also agreed to acquire Acordis Speciality Fibres (Acordis), a privately held company based in the United Kingdom that  licenses patent rights and supplies materials to ConvaTec for its Wound Care line. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of this year.
 - 
     
 
Outlook
 
The Company estimates its fully-diluted earnings per share for 2004 to be between $1.50 and $1.55 on an adjusted non-GAAP basis.  These estimates exclude certain types of items included in earnings per share under GAAP as set forth under "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information," most significantly, an expected gain on disposition of the Mead Johnson Adult Nutritional business, reduced by charges for announced milestone payments for in-process research and development in connection with external development activities, in-process research and development in the Acordis acquisition, and anticipated restructurings and relocations. Taking the specified items into account, the estimate of fully diluted earnings per share would be $1.50 to $1.55.   Details reconciling adjusted non-GAAP amounts with the amounts reflecting specified items are provided in supplemental materials available on the Company's website. This information does not include other items, which may occur during the year, such as charges relating to new transactions or arrangements resulting in write-off of in-process research and development, restructurings and significant legal proceedings.
 
These estimates take into account estimated losses of net sales in 2004 in the range of $1.2 to $1.3 billion from the 2003 levels for products which have lost or will lose exclusivity protections in 2003 or 2004, specifically the Metformin franchise in the U.S., TAXOL in Europe, MONOPRIL in the U.S. and Canada, Pravastatin in certain countries in Europe, PARAPLATIN in the U.S. and SERZONE in the U.S.   Sales rose in 2003, resulting in a higher base, and generic competition did not develop in 2003 as expected, thereby increasing the expected level of exclusivity losses in 2004. In addition, exclusivity losses for PARAPLATIN anticipated to occur primarily in 2005 will be accelerated into 2004 if an anticipated six-month extension based on pediatric studies is not obtained by April 2004.   The amounts of sales reductions from exclusivity losses, their realization in particular periods and the eventual levels of remaining sales revenues are uncertain and dependent on the levels of sales at the time exclusivity protection ends, the timing and degree of development of generic competition (speed of approvals, market entry and impact) and other factors.  Subject to these uncertainties, the Company estimates that there will be incremental exclusivity losses in each of the next several years, as measured against the net sales levels at the time exclusivity will be lost, of between $1 billion and the amount for 2004 in each year.
 
The Company believes these exclusivity losses will be more or less offset by growth of revenues resulting from growth of the Company's in-line products, including PLAVIX, AVAPRO/AVALIDE and SUSTIVA, the growth of recently launched exclusive products, ABILIFY and REYATAZ, and by the introduction of late-stage pipeline products that may be approved within the next thirty-six months such as ERBITUX, CTLA4Ig, entecavir and muraglitazar.  Additionally, OTN sales growth is expected to continue.  This belief is subject to any adverse determination that may occur with respect to the PLAVIX patent litigation described below.  In addition, there can be no assurance as to when or if the Company will obtain the required regulatory approvals for its late-stage pipeline products.  The Company expects the resulting product mix to pressure Company margins because the products losing exclusivity protection carry higher margins than products expected to grow sales.
The Company has historically reviewed and will continue to review its cost base.  Decisions that may be taken as a result of these reviews may result in restructuring or other charges later this year or in future periods.  At the same time, the Company expects to invest behind in-line products and in its research and development pipeline, particularly late-stage products, reflected in guidance.   External development and licensing will remain important elements of the Company's strategy, but the potential cost and impact of any transactions that may be entered into in the future are not built into the Company's plans or guidance with respect to 2004 earnings.
 
The Company and its subsidiaries are the subject of a number of significant pending lawsuits, claims, proceedings and investigations.  For discussion of these matters and their potential impact on the Company, please refer to the discussion above of reserves for certain legal matters established in the fourth quarter and to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for Third Quarter of 2003.
 
The Company's expectations for future sales growth described above include substantial expected increases in sales of PLAVIX which had net sales of approximately $2.5 billion in 2003.  The composition of matter patent for PLAVIX , which expires in 2011, is currently the subject of litigation in the United States.  The Company continues to believe that the patent is valid and that it is infringed, and with its alliance partner and patent-holder Sanofi-Synthelabo, is vigorously pursuing the case.  It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the outcome of this litigation, or if there were an adverse determination in this litigation, the timing of potential generic competition for PLAVIX.  However, if generic competition were to occur, the Company believes it is very unlikely to occur before sometime in the year 2005.  Loss of market exclusivity for PLAVIX and the subsequent development of generic competition would be material to the Company's sales of PLAVIX and results of operations and cash flows and could be material to its financial condition and liquidity.
 
 
Use Of Non-GAAP Financial Information
 
This press release contains non-GAAP earnings per share information adjusted to exclude certain  costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items.  Among the items in GAAP earnings but excluded for purposes of determining adjusted earnings are: gains or losses from sale of product lines, from sale or write-down of equity investments and from discontinuations of operations; restructuring and similar charges; charges relating to significant legal proceedings; co-promotion or alliance charges and payments for in-process research and development which under GAAP are immediately expensed rather than amortized over the life of the agreement. This information is intended to enhance an investor's overall understanding of the Company's past financial performance and prospects for the future. For example, non-GAAP earnings per share information is an indication of the Company's baseline performance before items that are considered by the Company to be not reflective of the Company's operational results.   In addition, this information is among the primary indicators the Company uses as a basis for evaluating Company performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting of future periods.  This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for diluted earnings per share prepared in accordance with GAAP.
