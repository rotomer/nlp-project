(a)  
The Parent Guarantor agrees to indemnify the Agent, each Lender, each of their Affiliates and the directors, officers, employees and agents of the foregoing (each such Person being called an 
Indemnitee
) against, and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including reasonable counsel fees and expenses, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of:
 
(i)  
the Transactions; or
 
(ii)  
any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to the Transactions, whether or not any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that:

(a)  
If, for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum owing hereunder in one currency into another currency, each party hereto agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction the first currency could be purchased with such other currency on the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which final judgment is given.
 
(b)  
The obligations of any Obligor in respect of any sum due to any Finance Party shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the 
Judgment Currency
), other than the currency in which such sum is stated to be due hereunder (the 
Agreement Currency
), be discharged only to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by the Finance Party of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Finance Party may in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency, if the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Finance Party in the Agreement Currency, such Obligor agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Finance Party against such loss. The obligations of the Obligors contained in this Clause 14.2 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all other amounts owing hereunder.
 
 
The Parent Guarantor shall within five Business Days of demand indemnify the Agent against any cost, loss or liability incurred by the Agent (acting reasonably) as a result of:
 
(a)

),
 
Clause 12 (
Tax gross-up and indemnities

Increased costs
) or Schedule 4 (
Mandatory Cost formula

Paragraph (a) above does not in any way limit the obligations of any Obligor under the Finance Documents.
 
 
(c)

(a)  
The Borrower shall indemnify each Finance Party for all costs and expenses reasonably incurred by that Finance Party as a result of steps taken by it under Clause 15.1 (
Mitigation
).
 
(b)  
A Finance Party is not obliged to take any steps under Clause 15.1 (
Mitigation
) if, in the opinion of that Finance Party (acting reasonably), to do so would be disadvantageous to it, provided that the incurring of any costs and expenses by a Finance Party as a result of any steps taken by it under Clause 15.1 (
Mitigation
) shall not be disadvantageous to such Finance Party for the purposes of this Clause 15.2(b).
 
 
 
The Parent Guarantor agrees to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Arrangers or the Agent in connection with the entering into of the Finance Documents or in connection with any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions of the Finance Documents (including the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of a single counsel), or incurred by any of the Finance Parties in connection with the enforcement of their rights in connection with the Finance Documents or in connection with the Loans made thereunder, including the fees and disbursements of counsel to the Agent and, in the case of enforcement, each Finance Party.
 
 
 
Each Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally jointly and severally:
 
(a)  
guarantees to each Finance Party punctual performance by the Borrower of all of its obligations under the Finance Documents;
 
(b)  
undertakes with each Finance Party that whenever the Borrower does not pay any amount when due under or in connection with any Finance Document,
 
-35-
that Guarantor shall within three Business Days of demand pay that amount as if it was the principal obligor; and
 
(c)  
indemnifies each Finance Party within three Business Days of demand against any cost, loss or liability suffered by that Finance Party if any obligation guaranteed by it is or becomes unenforceable, invalid or illegal. The amount of the cost, loss or liability shall be equal to the amount which that Finance Party would otherwise have been entitled to recover.
 
 
This guarantee is a continuing guarantee and will extend to the ultimate balance of sums payable by any Obligor under the Finance Documents, regardless of any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part.
 
 
If any payment by an Obligor or any discharge given by a Finance Party (whether in respect of the obligations of any Obligor or any security for those obligations or otherwise) is avoided or reduced as a result of insolvency or any similar event:
 
(a)  
the liability of each Obligor shall continue as if the payment, discharge, avoidance or reduction had not occurred; and
 
(b)  
each Finance Party shall be entitled to recover the value or amount of that security or payment from each Obligor, as if the payment, discharge, avoidance or reduction had not occurred.
 
 
The obligations of each Guarantor under this Clause 17 (
Guarantee and Indemnity
) will not be affected by an act, omission, matter or thing which, but for this Clause, would reduce, release or prejudice any of its obligations under this Clause 17 (without limitation and whether or not known to it or any Finance Party) including:
 
(a)  
any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with, any Obligor or other Person;
 
(b)  
the release of any other Obligor or any other Person under the terms of any composition or arrangement with any creditor of any member of the BMS Group;
 
(c)  
the taking, variation, compromise, exchange, renewal or release of, or refusal or neglect to perfect, take up or enforce, any rights against, or security over assets of, any Obligor or other Person or any non-presentation or non-observance of any formality or other requirement in respect of any instrument or any failure to realise the full value of any security;
 
(d)  
any incapacity or lack of power, authority or legal personality of or dissolution or change in the members or status of an Obligor or any other Person;
 
 
 
-36-
 
 
(e)  
any amendment (however fundamental) or replacement of a Finance Document or any other document or security;
 
(f)  
any unenforceability, illegality or invalidity of any obligation of any Person under any Finance Document or any other document or security; or
 
(g)  
any insolvency or similar proceedings.
 
 
Each Guarantor waives any right it may have of first requiring any Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) to proceed against or enforce any other rights or security or claim payment from any Person before claiming from that Guarantor under this Clause 17 (
Guarantee and Indemnity
). This waiver applies irrespective of any law or any provision of a Finance Document to the contrary.
 
 
Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full, each Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) may:
 
(a)  
refrain from applying or enforcing any other moneys, security or rights held or received by that Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) in respect of those amounts, or apply and enforce the same in such manner and order as it sees fit (whether against those amounts or otherwise) and no Guarantor shall be entitled to the benefit of the same; and
 
(b)  
hold in an interest-bearing suspense account any moneys received from any Guarantor or on account of any Guarantors liability under this Clause 17 (
Guarantee and Indemnity
).
 
 
Whilst any amounts remain outstanding under or in connection with the Finance Documents and unless the Agent otherwise directs, no Guarantor will exercise any rights which it may have by reason of performance by it of its obligations under the Finance Documents:
 
(a)  
to be indemnified by an Obligor;
 
(b)  
to claim any contribution from any other guarantor of any Obligors obligations under the Finance Documents; and/or
 
(c)  
to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Finance Parties under the Finance Documents or of any other guarantee or security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, the Finance Documents by any Finance Party.
 
-37-
 
 
If any Guarantor (a 
Retiring Guarantor
) ceases to be a Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents then on the date such Retiring Guarantor ceases to be a Guarantor:
 
(a)  
that Retiring Guarantor is released by each other Guarantor from any liability (whether past, present or future and whether actual or contingent) to make a contribution to any other Guarantor arising by reason of the performance by any other Guarantor of its obligations under the Finance Documents; and
 
(b)  
each other Guarantor waives any rights it may have by reason of the performance of its obligations under the Finance Documents to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Finance Parties under any Finance Document or of any other security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, any Finance Document where such rights or security are granted by or in relation to the assets of the Retiring Guarantor.
 
 
This guarantee is in addition to and is not in any way prejudiced by any other guarantee or security now or subsequently held by any Finance Party.
 
 
The obligations of any Guarantor incorporated in the Netherlands under this Agreement shall exclude and shall not be or be construed as any guarantee, indemnity or security, to the extent that this would be deemed 
ultra vires
 within the meaning of Section 2.7 of the Dutch Civil Code.
 
 
The liabilities of each Guarantor incorporated in Luxembourg (a "Luxembourg Guarantor"), under this Clause 17 shall be limited, at any time, to a maximum aggregate amount equal to (i) the market value of the assets of such Luxembourg Guarantor at the moment when the guarantee created pursuant to this Clause 17 is enforced, determined in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Luxembourg and having regard to the status of the Luxembourg Guarantor as a group company, whose assets are assets forming part of the BMS Group, by a Luxembourg
rviseur d'entreprises
appointed by the president of the
Institut Luxembourgeois des Rviseurs d'Entreprises
upon request by the Agent less (ii) all liabilities incurred from time to time, by such Luxembourg Guarantor as reflected from time to time in the books of such Luxembourg Guarantor (but for the avoidance of doubt excluding the liability of such Luxembourg Guarantor under this Agreement). No Luxembourg Guarantor shall secure liabilities pursuant to this Agreement which would result in such Luxembourg Guarantor not complying with Luxembourg financial assistance regulations as set forth in Luxembourg corporate law.

(i)  
has made (and shall continue to make) its own independent investigation and assessment of the financial condition and affairs of each Obligor and its related entities in connection with its participation in this Agreement and has not relied exclusively on any information provided to it by the Existing Lender in connection with any Finance Document; and
 
(ii)  
will continue to make its own independent appraisal of the creditworthiness of each Obligor and its related entities whilst any amount is or may be outstanding under the Finance Documents or any Commitment is in force.

(i)  
accept a re-transfer from a New Lender of any of the rights and obligations assigned or transferred under this Clause 23; or
 
(ii)  
support any losses directly or indirectly incurred by the New Lender by reason of the non-performance by any Obligor of its obligations under the Finance Documents or otherwise.
 
 
(a)  
Subject to the conditions set out in Clause 23.2 (

(c)  
On the Transfer Date:
 
(i)  
to the extent that in the Transfer Certificate the Existing Lender seeks to transfer by novation its rights and obligations under the Finance Documents each of the Obligors and the Existing Lender shall be released from further obligations towards one another under the
 
-63-
Finance Documents and their respective rights against one another under the Finance Documents shall be cancelled (being the 
Discharged Rights and Obligations
);
 
(ii)  
each of the Obligors and the New Lender shall assume obligations towards one another and/or acquire rights against one another which differ from the Discharged Rights and Obligations only insofar as that Obligor and the New Lender have assumed and/or acquired the same in place of that Obligor and the Existing Lender;
 
(iii)  
the Agent, the Arrangers, the New Lender and other Lenders shall acquire the same rights and assume the same obligations between themselves as they would have acquired and assumed had the New Lender been an Original Lender with the rights and/or obligations acquired or assumed by it as a result of the transfer and to that extent the Agent, the Arrangers and the Existing Lender shall each be released from further obligations to each other under the Finance Documents; and
 
(iv)  
the New Lender shall become a Party as a Lender.
 
 
The Agent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after it has executed a Transfer Certificate, send to the Borrower a copy of that Transfer Certificate.

no Obligor shall incur any additional cost or expense (including, without limitation, pursuant to Clause 12 (
Tax Gross-Up and Indemnities

Other Indemnities

(b)  
third parties to a sub-participation arrangement entered into with a Finance Party shall have no rights under the Third Parties Act to enforce or to enjoy the benefit of any term of this Agreement; and

Nothing in this Agreement shall oblige the Agent or the Arranger to carry out any "know your customer" or other checks in relation to any person on behalf of any Lender and each Lender confirms to the Agent and the Arranger that it is solely responsible for any such checks it is required to carry out and that it may not rely on any statement in relation to such checks made by the Agent or the Arrangers.
 
 
Each Lender shall (in proportion to its share of the Total Commitments or, if the Total Commitments are then zero, to its share of the Total Commitments immediately prior to their reduction to zero) indemnify the Agent, within three Business Days of demand, against any cost, loss or liability incurred by the Agent (otherwise than by reason of the Agents gross negligence or wilful misconduct) in acting as Agent under the Finance Documents (unless the Agent has been reimbursed by an Obligor pursuant to a Finance Document).
 
 
(a)  
The Agent may resign and appoint one of its Affiliates acting through an office in the United Kingdom as successor by giving notice to the other Finance Parties and the Borrower.
 
(b)   
Alternatively, the Agent may resign by giving notice to the other Finance Parties and the Borrower, in which case the Majority Lenders (may with the prior written consent of the Borrower, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) appoint a successor Agent.
 
(c)    
If the Majority Lenders have not appointed a successor Agent in accordance with paragraph (b) above within 30 days after notice of resignation was given, the Agent may (with the prior written consent of the Borrower , such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) appoint a successor Agent (acting through an office in the United Kingdom).
 
(d)   
The retiring Agent shall, at its own cost, make available to the successor Agent such documents and records and provide such assistance as the
 
-69-
successor Agent may reasonably request for the purposes of performing its functions as Agent under the Finance Documents.
 
(e)  
The Agents resignation notice shall only take effect upon the appointment of a successor.
 
(f)  
Upon the appointment of a successor, the retiring Agent shall be discharged from any further obligation in respect of the Finance Documents but shall remain entitled to the benefit of this Clause 25 (
Role of the Agent and the Arrangers
). Its successor and each of the other Parties shall have the same rights and obligations amongst themselves as they would have had if such successor had been an original Party.
 
(g)  
After consultation with the Borrower, the Majority Lenders may, by notice to the Agent, require it to resign in accordance with paragraph (b) above. In this event, the Agent shall resign in accordance with paragraph (b) above.
 
 
(a)  
In acting as agent for the Finance Parties, the Agent shall be regarded as acting through its agency division which shall be treated as a separate entity from any other of its divisions or departments.
 
(b)  
If information is received by another division or department of the Agent, it may be treated as confidential to that division or department and the Agent shall not be deemed to have notice of it.
 
 
(a)   
The Agent may treat each Lender as a Lender, entitled to payments under this Agreement and acting through its Facility Office unless it has received not less than five Business Days prior notice from that Lender to the contrary in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
 
(b)  
Each Lender shall supply the Agent with any information required by the Agent in order to calculate the Mandatory Cost in accordance with Schedule 4 (
Mandatory Cost formula
).
 
 
Without affecting the responsibility of any Obligor for information supplied by it or on its behalf in connection with any Finance Document, each Lender confirms to the Agent and the Arrangers that it has been, and will continue to be, solely responsible for making its own independent appraisal and investigation of all risks arising under or in connection with any Finance Document including but not limited to:
 
(a)  
the financial condition, status and nature of each Obligor;
 
(b)  
the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or enforceability of any Finance Document and any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under or in connection with any Finance Document;
 
 
-70-
 
 
(c)  
whether that Lender has recourse, and the nature and extent of that recourse, against any Party or any of its respective assets under or in connection with any Finance Document, the transactions contemplated by the Finance Documents or any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under or in connection with any Finance Document; and
 
(d)  
the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of the Information Memorandum and any other information provided by the Agent, any Party or by any other Person under or in connection with any Finance Document, the transactions contemplated by the Finance Documents or any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under or in connection with any Finance Document.
 
 
If a Reference Bank (or, if a Reference Bank is not a Lender, the Lender of which it is an Affiliate) ceases to be a Lender, the Agent shall (in consultation with the Borrower) appoint another Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender to replace that Reference Bank.
 
 
If any Party owes an amount to the Agent under the Finance Documents the Agent may, after giving notice to that Party, deduct an amount not exceeding that amount from any payment to that Party which the Agent would otherwise be obliged to make under the Finance Documents and apply the amount deducted in or towards satisfaction of the amount owed. For the purposes of the Finance Documents that Party shall be regarded as having received any amount so deducted.
 
 
No provision of this Agreement will:
 
(a)  
subject to the specific obligations of the Finance Parties hereunder, interfere with the right of any Finance Party to arrange its affairs (tax or otherwise) in whatever manner it thinks fit;
 
(b)  
oblige any Finance Party to investigate or claim any credit, relief, remission or repayment available to it or the extent, order and manner of any claim; or
 
(c)  
oblige any Finance Party to disclose any information relating to its affairs (tax or otherwise) or any computations in respect of Tax.
 
-71-
 
 
 
If a Finance Party (a 
Recovering Finance Party
) receives or recovers any amount from an Obligor other than in accordance with Clause 28 (
Payment mechanics
) and applies that amount to a payment due under the Finance Documents then:
 
(a)  
the Recovering Finance Party shall, within three Business Days, notify details of the receipt or recovery, to the Agent;
 
(b)  
the Agent shall determine whether the receipt or recovery is in excess of the amount the Recovering Finance Party would have been paid had the receipt or recovery been received or made by the Agent and distributed in accordance with Clause 28 (
Payment mechanics
), without taking account of any Tax which would be imposed on the Agent in relation to the receipt, recovery or distribution; and
 
(c)  
the Recovering Finance Party shall, within three Business Days of demand by the Agent, pay to the Agent an amount (the 
Sharing Payment
) equal to such receipt or recovery less any amount which the Agent determines may be retained by the Recovering Finance Party as its share of any payment to be made, in accordance with Clause 28.5 (
Partial payments
).
 
 
The Agent shall treat the Sharing Payment as if it had been paid by the relevant Obligor and distribute it between the Finance Parties (other than the Recovering Finance Party) in accordance with Clause 28.5 (
Partial payments
).
 
 
(a)  
On a distribution by the Agent under Clause 27.2 (
Redistribution of payments
), the Recovering Finance Party will be subrogated to the rights of the Finance Parties which have shared in the redistribution.
 
(b)  
If and to the extent that the Recovering Finance Party is not able to rely on its rights under paragraph (a) above, the relevant Obligor shall be liable to the Recovering Finance Party for a debt equal to the Sharing Payment which is immediately due and payable.
 
 
If any part of the Sharing Payment received or recovered by a Recovering Finance Party becomes repayable and is repaid by that Recovering Finance Party, then:
 
(a)  
each Finance Party which has received a share of the relevant Sharing Payment pursuant to Clause 27.2 (
Redistribution of payments
) shall, upon request of the Agent, pay to the Agent for account of that Recovering Finance Party an amount equal to the appropriate part of its share of the Sharing Payment (together with an amount as is necessary to reimburse that
 
-72-
Recovering Finance Party for its proportion of any interest on the Sharing Payment which that Recovering Finance Party is required to pay); and
 
(b)  
that Recovering Finance Partys rights of subrogation in respect of any reimbursement shall be cancelled and the relevant Obligor will be liable to the reimbursing Finance Party for the amount so reimbursed.
 
 
(a)  
This Clause 27 shall not apply to the extent that the Recovering Finance Party would not, after making any payment pursuant to this Clause, have a valid and enforceable claim against the relevant Obligor.
 
(b)  
A Recovering Finance Party is not obliged to share with any other Finance Party any amount which the Recovering Finance Party has received or recovered as a result of taking legal or arbitration proceedings, if:
 
(i)  
it notified that other Finance Party of the legal or arbitration proceedings; and
 
(ii)  
that other Finance Party had an opportunity to participate in those legal or arbitration proceedings but did not do so as soon as reasonably practicable having received notice and did not take separate legal or arbitration proceedings.
 
 
 
(a)  
On each date on which an Obligor or a Lender is required to make a payment under a Finance Document, that Obligor or Lender shall make the same available to the Agent (unless a contrary indication appears in a Finance Document) for value on the due date at the time and in such funds specified by the Agent as being customary at the time for settlement of transactions in the relevant currency in the place of payment.
 
(b)  
Payment shall be made to such account in the principal financial centre of the country of that currency with such bank as the Agent specifies.
 
 
Each payment received by the Agent under the Finance Documents for another Party shall, subject to Clause 28.3 (
Distributions to an Obligor
) and Clause 28.4 (
Clawback
) be made available by the Agent as soon as practicable after receipt to the Party entitled to receive payment in accordance with this Agreement (in the case of a Lender, for the account of its Facility Office), to such account as that Party may notify to the Agent by not less than five Business Days notice with a bank in the principal financial centre of the country of that currency.
 
-73-
 
 
The Agent may (with the consent of the Obligor or in accordance with Clause 29 (
Set-off
)) apply any amount received by it for that Obligor in or towards payment (on the date and in the currency and funds of receipt) of any amount due from that Obligor under the Finance Documents or in or towards purchase of any amount of any currency to be so applied.
 
 
(a)  
Where a sum is to be paid to the Agent under the Finance Documents for another Party, the Agent is not obliged to pay that sum to that other Party (or to enter into or perform any related exchange contract) until it has been able to establish to its satisfaction that it has actually received that sum.
 
(b)  
If the Agent pays an amount to another Party and it proves to be the case that the Agent had not actually received that amount, then the Party to whom that amount (or the proceeds of any related exchange contract) was paid by the Agent shall on demand refund the same to the Agent together with interest on that amount from the date of payment to the date of receipt by the Agent, calculated by the Agent to reflect its cost of funds.
 
 
(a)  
If the Agent receives a payment that is insufficient to discharge all the amounts then due and payable by an Obligor under the Finance Documents, the Agent shall apply that payment towards the obligations of that Obligor under the Finance Documents in the following order:
 
(i)  
f
irst
, in or towards payment pro rata of any unpaid fees, costs and expenses of the Agent under the Finance Documents;
 
(ii)  
s
econdly
, in or towards payment pro rata of any accrued interest, fee or commission due but unpaid under this Agreement;
 
(iii)  
thirdly
, in or towards payment pro rata of any principal due but unpaid under this Agreement; and
 
(iv)  
fourthly
, in or towards payment pro rata of any other sum due but unpaid under the Finance Documents.
 
(b)  
The Agent shall, if so directed by the Majority Lenders, vary the order set out in paragraphs (a)(ii) to (iv) above.
 
(c)  
Paragraphs (a) and (b) above will override any appropriation made by an Obligor.
 
 
All payments to be made by an Obligor under the Finance Documents shall be calculated and be made without (and free and clear of any deduction for) set-off or counterclaim.
 
-74-
 
 
(a)  
Any payment which is due to be made on a day that is not a Business Day shall be made on the next Business Day in the same calendar month (if there is one) or the preceding Business Day (if there is not).
 
(b)  
During any extension of the due date for payment of any principal or Unpaid Sum under this Agreement interest is payable on the principal or Unpaid Sum at the rate payable on the original due date.
 
 
(a)  
Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) below, Dollars is the currency of account and payment for any sum due from an Obligor under any Finance Document.
 
(b)  
Each payment in respect of costs, expenses or Taxes shall be made in the currency in which the costs, expenses or Taxes are incurred.
 
(c)  
Any amount expressed to be payable in a currency other than Dollars shall be paid in that other currency.
 
 
(a)  
Unless otherwise prohibited by law, if more than one currency or currency unit are at the same time recognised by the central bank of any country as the lawful currency of that country, then:
 
(i)  
any reference in the Finance Documents to, and any obligations arising under the Finance Documents in, the currency of that country shall be translated into, or paid in, the currency or currency unit of that country designated by the Agent (after consultation with the Borrower); and
 
(ii)  
any translation from one currency or currency unit to another shall be at the official rate of exchange recognised by the central bank for the conversion of that currency or currency unit into the other, rounded up or down by the Agent (acting reasonably).
 
(b)  
If a change in any currency of a country occurs, the Parties will enter negotiations in good faith with a view to agreeing any amendment which may be necessary to this Agreement to comply with any generally accepted conventions and market practice in the Relevant Interbank Market and otherwise to reflect the change in currency.
 
 
 
-75-
 
 
At any time after an Event of Default has occurred which is continuing, a Finance Party may on giving notice to the Obligor set off any matured obligation due from an Obligor under the Finance Documents (to the extent beneficially owned by that Finance Party) against any matured obligation owed by that Finance Party to that Obligor, regardless of the place of payment, booking branch or currency of either obligation. If the obligations are in different currencies, the Finance Party may convert either obligation at a market rate of exchange in its usual course of business for the purpose of the set-off.

Re:
 
 
 
Dear Sirs
 
We understand that you are considering acquiring an interest in the Facility. In consideration of us agreeing to make available to you certain information, by your signature of a copy of this letter you agree as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
-100-
 
 
 
We agree that you may disclose Confidential Information:
 
 
 
 
 
You agree (to the extent permitted by law) to inform us and the Borrower of the full circumstances of any disclosure under paragraph 2(b) or upon becoming aware that Confidential Information has been disclosed in breach of this letter.
 
 
Should you decide not to acquire an interest in the Facility, you shall return to us all Confidential Information supplied to you by us and destroy or permanently erase all copies of Confidential Information made by you and use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that anyone to whom you have supplied any Confidential Information destroys or permanently erases such Confidential Information and any copies made by them, in each case save to the extent that you or the recipients are required to retain any such Confidential Information by any applicable law, rule or regulation or by any competent judicial, governmental, supervisory or regulatory body, or where the Confidential Information has been disclosed under paragraph 2(b) above.
 
 
The obligations in this letter are continuing and, in particular, shall survive the termination of any discussions or negotiations between you and us. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the obligations in this letter shall cease (a) if you become a party to or otherwise acquire (by assignment or transfer) a direct interest in the Facility or (b) (where (a) does not apply) twelve months after you have returned all Confidential Information supplied to you by us and destroyed or permanently erased all copies of Confidential Information made by you (other than any such Confidential Information or copies which have been disclosed under paragraph 2 above (other than sub-paragraph 2(a)) or which, pursuant to paragraph 4 above, are not required to be returned or destroyed).
 
-101-
 
 
You acknowledge and agree that:
 
 
 
 
This letter sets out the full extent of your obligations of confidentiality owed to us and the Borrower in relation to the information which is the subject of this letter. No failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege under this letter will operate as a waiver thereof nor will any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege preclude any further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privileges under this letter. The terms of this letter and your obligations under this letter may only be amended or modified by written agreement between you, us and the Borrower.
 
 
 
You acknowledge that some or all of the Confidential Information is or may be price-sensitive or material non-public information and that the use of such information may be regulated or prohibited by applicable legislation, including legislation relating to insider dealing, and you undertake to use any Confidential Information only in accordance with your compliance policies and contractual obligations and applicable law, including United States federal and state securities laws.
 
 
 
The undertakings given by you under this letter are given to us and (without implying any fiduciary obligations on our part) are also given for the benefit of, and may be enforced and relied upon by, the Borrower, the Guarantors and each other member of the Group.
 
-102-
 
 
 
 
 
This letter (including the agreement constituted by your acknowledgement of its terms) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the English law and the parties submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English court, [which shall have jurisdiction over all litigations relating to the present undertaking].
 
 
In this Confidentiality Undertaking (including the acknowledgement set out below) capitalised terms not defined in this paragraph have the meanings attributed to them in the Facility Agreement. To the extent of any inconsistency between a term defined in this Confidentiality Agreement and in the Facility Agreement, the term as defined in this Confidentiality Agreement shall prevail and:

Facility Agreement
 means the agreement entered into in relation to the provision of the Facility to the Borrower;
 
Group
