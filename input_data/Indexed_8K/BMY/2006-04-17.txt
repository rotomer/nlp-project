Item 4.01. Change in Registrant's Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.
As previously reported, on March 14, 2006, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (the "Company") appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP ("D&T") as the independent registered public accounting firm ("auditors") for the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Savings and Investment Program (the "Plan") for the 2005 and 2006 fiscal years and dismissed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as the Plan's auditors.
On April 11, 2006, D&T resigned as the Plan's auditors for the year ended December 31, 2005 due to potential independence concerns but will remain the Plan's auditors for the 2006 fiscal year. D&T did not perform any audit procedures on the Plan's financial statements prior to such date. The Plan's Form 11-K is expected to be filed in a timely manner.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
