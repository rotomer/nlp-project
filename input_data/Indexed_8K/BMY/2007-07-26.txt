Also furnished and incorporated by reference as Exhibit 99.2 was certain supplemental information posted on the Company's website at . On May 31, 2007, the Company filed a Form 8-K/A furnishing revised supplemental information to include net sales, months on hand, and estimated demand information for key products and growth drivers as of March 31, 2007 for the Company's International Pharmaceutical, Nutritionals and Other Health Care reporting segments.

As previously disclosed, the Company has calculated the estimated U.S. prescription data and estimated therapeutic category share based on information provided by IMS Health ("IMS"), a supplier of market research for the pharmaceutical industry. On July 23, 2007, IMS issued a Product News bulletin announcing that it had revised its previously issued projected prescription and unit volumes for PLAVIX* and Apotex's generic clopidogrel bisulfate product, which IMS had overstated for the months August 2006 through June 2007 due to market events surrounding the at-risk launch of generic clopidogrel bisulfate. Due to these unique circumstances, high degree of volatility and the compressed timeframe of these events, IMS applied a custom approach to estimate PLAVIX* and generic clopidogrel bisulfate product and market volumes beginning in July 2007.
The IMS overstatement of PLAVIX* prescription and unit volumes did not impact the Company's financial results or its reported net sales for PLAVIX* for the quarters ended September 30, 2006, December 31, 2006 or March 31, 2007.
The following table sets forth the Company's (i) previously reported estimated prescription change data and estimated therapeutic category share based on National Prescription Audit ("NPA") data for the quarters ended September 30, 2006 and December 31, 2006; (ii) previously reported estimated prescription change data and estimated therapeutic category share based on Next-Generation Prescription Services ("NGPS") version 2.0 data for the quarter ended March 31, 2007; and (iii) revised estimated prescription change data and estimated therapeutic category share based on revised NGPS version 2.0 data using the IMS custom approach.
The above IMS overstated data also impacted the Company's previously reported estimate of the adverse effect of the at-risk launch of generic clopidogrel bisulfate of $300 million to $350 million for the three months ended March 31, 2007. Based on the revised data issued by IMS, the Company now estimates the adverse effect of the at-risk launch of generic clopidogrel bisulfate to be $200 million to $250 million for the three months ended March 31, 2007.
The supplemental information posted on the Company's website has been updated to include revised estimated prescription change data and estimated therapeutic category share and the Company's revised estimate of the adverse effect of the at-risk launch of generic clopidogrel bisulfate, as described above. This revised supplemental information is furnished and incorporated by reference as Exhibit 99.2 to this Form 8-K/A.
