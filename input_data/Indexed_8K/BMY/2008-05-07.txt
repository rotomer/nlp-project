On May 2, 2008, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (the "Company") entered into a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") to sell the Company's ConvaTec business (the "Business") to Cidron Healthcare Limited (the "Buyer"), an affiliate of Nordic Capital Fund VII ("Nordic Capital") and Avista Capital Partners ("Avista"), for $4.1 billion in cash. The final purchase price is subject to adjustment based on (i) closing working capital of the Business and (ii) the amount (if greater than $1,500,000) by which EBITDA (as defined in the Agreement) as derived from the audited 2007 financial statements of the Business to be delivered by the Company between signing and closing is less than EBITDA as derived from the unaudited 2007 financial statements of the Business, multiplied by 11.5, up to a maximum such adjustment of $115,000,000. If EBITDA as derived from the audited 2007 financial statements of the Business is less than EBITDA as derived from the unaudited 2007 financial statements of the Business by more than $10,000,000, the Buyer may terminate the Agreement.
The sale of the Business will be effected through the transfer to the Buyer of (i) all of the outstanding capital stock of certain of the Company's indirect subsidiaries and (ii) certain specified assets and liabilities of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.
In the Agreement, the Company and the Buyer have made certain customary representations and warranties and have agreed to certain customary covenants. Specifically, (i) before the closing, the Company and its applicable subsidiaries will be subject to certain business conduct restrictions with respect to the Business and (ii) for three years following the closing, the Company will be prohibited from engaging in any business that competes in any material respect with the Business, subject to certain exceptions as described in the Agreement. The Agreement provides that the Company and the Buyer will indemnify each other for losses arising from certain breaches of the Agreement and for certain other liabilities.
The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2008, pending customary regulatory approvals (including in the United States and the European Union), delivery of the audited 2007 financial statements of the Business and satisfaction of certain other customary closing conditions. There is no financing condition to the obligations of the Buyer to consummate the transaction, and equity and debt commitments for the full purchase price are in place. The Buyer has entered into a fully committed loan agreement that provides for funding by the lenders thereunder, with no material conditions other than the conditions under the Agreement and customary conditions relating to the delivery of closing documents and financial information, as well as conditions related to the status of the Buyer. Nordic Capital and funds associated with Avista have severally guaranteed the obligations of the Buyer under the Agreement.
The Company and the Buyer have agreed to enter into related transaction agreements at the closing, including a transitional services agreement.
The foregoing description of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement itself, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
A copy of the press release announcing the transaction is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
On May 1, 2006, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company issued $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.450% Notes due 2018 and $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.125% Notes due 2038 in a registered public offering.

(i) Based solely on its review of a certificate from the Secretary of State of Delaware, the Company is validly existing as
 
a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus;
(ii) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
(iii) The Securities have been duly authorized by the Company, and, when duly executed and authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company and entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law;
(iv) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law; and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act;

(vi) The Company is not required, and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof, will not be required, to register as an "investment company", as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act (for purposes of this opinion, such counsel may rely on a certificate of an officer of the Company in a form satisfactory to the Representatives);
 
(vii) Each of the Registration Statement at the time it was last amended or deemed to be amended and the Prospectus, as of the date of such opinion (other than the financial statements and other information of a financial or accounting nature and the statement of eligibility (Form T-1) , as to which such counsel need express no opinion) appeared or appears on its face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; and
(viii) Although they do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, except for those referred to in the opinion in subsection (v) of this Section 8(b), they have no reason to believe (i) that the Registration Statement (insofar as related to the offering contemplated by the Prospectus) on April 28, 2008 (other than the financial statements and other information of a financial or accounting nature, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (ii) that the Pricing Disclosure Package, considered together, as of the Applicable Time (other than the financial statements and other information of a financial or accounting nature, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to stated a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (iii) that, as of its date, the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and other information of a financial or accounting nature, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (iv) that, as of the Closing Date, the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and other information of a financial or accounting nature, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
 
made, not misleading; and they do not know of any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which are not filed or described as required;
(c) Sandra Leung, general counsel for the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives her written opinion (with respect to the matters enumerated in (i) through (vi)) and letter (with respect to the matters enumerated in (vii) and (viii)), dated the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect that:
(i) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with power and authority (corporate and other) to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus;
(ii) The Company has an authorized capitalization as set forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and all of the issued shares of capital stock of the Company have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable;
(iii) To such counsel's knowledge and other than as set forth in the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is the subject which, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries; and, to such counsel's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others;
(iv) Neither the Company nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries is in violation of its By-laws or Certificate of Incorporation or, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, in default in the performance or observance of any obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound, except for such violations and defaults that individually and in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;
 
(v) The issue and sale of the Securities and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture and this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not (i) conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject, except for such breaches, violations and defaults that individually and in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) result in any violation of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company or (iii) result in any violation of any law, statute or any order, rule or regulation known to such counsel of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties, except for such breaches, violations and defaults that individually and in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;
(vi) No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency or body is required for the issue and sale of the Securities or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Indenture, except such as have been obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act, or which if not obtained would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters;
(vii) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto, made by the Company prior to the Closing Date (other than the financial statements and other information of a financial or accounting nature, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, each appeared on its face to be appropriately
 
responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; although such counsel does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in such documents, such counsel has no reason to believe that any of such documents (other than the financial statements and other information of a financial or accounting nature, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they became effective or were so filed, as the case may be, contained, in the case of a registration statement which became effective under the Act, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or, in the case of other documents which were filed under the Act or the Exchange Act with the Commission, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading; and
(viii) The Registration Statement, the Prospectus and any further amendments and supplements thereto, as applicable, made by the Company prior to the Closing Date (other than the financial statements and other information of a financial or accounting nature, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; although such counsel does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, such counsel has no reason to believe (i) that the Registration Statement (insofar as related to the offering contemplated by the Prospectus) on April 28, 2008 (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (ii) that the Pricing Disclosure Package, considered together, as of the Applicable Time (other than the financial statements and other information of a financial or accounting nature, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
 
misleading; or (iii) that, as of its date and as of the Closing Date, the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and other information of a financial or accounting nature, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and such counsel does not know of any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which are not filed or described as required;
(d) The Representatives shall have received from Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Indenture, the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
(e) On the date of the Prospectus at a time prior to the execution of this Agreement, at 9:30 a.m., New York City time, on the effective date of any post effective amendment to the Registration Statement filed subsequent to the date of this Agreement and also at the Closing Date, Deloitte & Touche LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters, dated the respective dates of delivery thereof, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect set forth in Annex I hereto;
(f) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus any significant loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Pricing Prospectus there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity
 
or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus and this Agreement;
(g) On or after the Applicable Time (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities or preferred stock by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or preferred stock;

(i) The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(c) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses on the Business Day next succeeding the date of this Agreement; and
(j) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at the Closing Date certificates of officers of the Company on behalf of the Company, reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the
 
representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such Closing Date, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Closing Date, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (f)(i) and (ii) of this Section.
If any of the conditions specified in this Section 8 shall not have been fulfilled when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancelation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.
The documents required to be delivered by this Section 8 shall be delivered to the offices of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, at 125 Broad Street, New York, NY 10004 (the "Closing Location"), on the Closing Date.

Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses.
10.
Indemnification and Contribution.
(a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to
 
Rule 433(d) under the Act (otherwise than as a result of a breach by an Underwriter of Section 6(a) hereof with respect to any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act) or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
(b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the indemnified party has determined, in its reasonable judgment, that there may be one or more defenses available to the indemnified party which may be different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party and that the existence of such different or additional defenses creates, in the reasonable judgment of such indemnified party, a conflict in connection with the joint representation of the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, then the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and in that event the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel for the indemnified party shall be paid by the indemnifying party; provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall only be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of a single law firm (and any reasonably necessary local counsel) employed by all of the indemnified parties unless any indemnified party has determined, in its reasonable judgment, that there may be one or more defenses available to it which may be different from or additional to those available to another indemnified party and that the existence of such different or additional defense creates, in its reasonable judgment, a conflict in connection with the joint representation of the indemnified parties, in which case the indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of a separate single law firm (and any reasonably necessary local counsel) employed by each such indemnified party to which such
 
conflict relates. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 10 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
 
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 10 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 10 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
11. If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the
Default by an Underwriter.
 
Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 11, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Pricing Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
provided
however
12. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 10 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7, 9 and 10 hereof shall survive the termination or cancelation of this Agreement.
Representations and Indemnities to Survive
13. . The Company is authorized, subject to applicable law, to disclose any and all aspects of this potential transaction that are necessary to support any U.S. federal income tax benefits expected to be claimed with respect to such transaction, without the Underwriters imposing any limitation of any kind.

Registrar and Paying Agent
The Company shall maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, an office or agency where Notes may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and an office or agency where Notes may be presented for payment or for exchange.

(b) as calculated by the Quotation Agent, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments for principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360 day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) using a discount rate equal to the sum of the Reference Dealer Rate plus 30 basis points;
plus, in each of the cases (a) and (b) above, accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to be redeemed to, but not including, the Redemption Date.
Notice of any redemption of the Notes shall be given in the manner and otherwise in accordance with the provisions of Section 1104 of the Indenture; provided, however, that any such notice in lieu of stating the applicable Redemption Price shall state the manner in which the Redemption Price shall be calculated. If the Company has given notice of redemption as provided in the Indenture and funds for the redemption of any Notes called for redemption have been made available on the Redemption Date referred to in that notice, such Notes will cease to bear interest on such Redemption Date.

At or prior to the time of giving any notice of redemption to the Holders of any Notes to be redeemed, the Company shall deliver an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee setting forth the calculation of the Redemption Price applicable to such redemption. The Trustee shall be under no duty to inquire into, may conclusively presume the correctness of, and shall be fully protected in relying upon the Redemption Price as so calculated and set forth in such Officers' Certificate.
 
Payment of Additional Amounts

(2) to any Holder that is not the sole beneficial owner of the Notes, or that is a fiduciary or partnership, but only to the extent that the beneficial owner, a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary, or a member of the partnership would not have been entitled to the payment of an additional amount had such beneficial owner, beneficiary, settlor or member received directly its beneficial or distributive share of the payment;
(3) to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely because the beneficial owner or any other person failed to comply with
 
certification, identification or information reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the United States of the Holder or beneficial owner of the Notes, if compliance is required by statute, by regulation of the United States Treasury Department or by an applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a party as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
(4) to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed other than by deduction or withholding by the Company or a Paying Agent from the payment;

(7) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge any paying agent (which term may include the Company) must withhold from any payment of principal of or interest on any note, if such payment can be made without such withholding by any other paying agent;
(8) to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that would not have been so imposed or withheld but for the presentation by the Holder of a Note for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later; or
(9) in the case of any combination of the above items.

"Non-U.S. Holder" means (a) an individual that is a nonresident alien, (b) a corporation organized or created under non-U.S. law, or (c) an estate or trust that is not taxable in the U.S. on its worldwide income.
Redemption Upon a Tax Event

No redemption pursuant to (b) above may be made unless the Company shall have received an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that an act taken by a taxing authority of the United States results in a substantial probability that the Company will or may be required to pay the Additional Amounts and the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee a certificate, signed by an officer of the Company duly authorized in or pursuant to a Board Resolution stating, that based on such opinion, the Company is entitled to redeem the Notes pursuant to their terms.
Further Issues
The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the Holders of the Notes, create and issue further Notes ranking equally and ratably with the Notes in all respects, or in all respects except for the issue date, the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date or except for the first payment of interest following the issue date of those further Notes. Any further Notes will be consolidated and form a single series with the Notes and will have the same terms as to status, redemption or otherwise as the Notes.

Sinking Fund
The Notes will not be subject to any sinking fund.
Default
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of all the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.

After that time, unless otherwise required by mandatory provisions of any unclaimed property law, the Holder of this Note will be able to seek any payment to which such Holder may be entitled to collect only from the Company.

(3) to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely because the beneficial owner or any other person failed to comply with
 
certification, identification or information reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the United States of the Holder or beneficial owner of the Notes, if compliance is required by statute, by regulation of the United States Treasury Department or by an applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a party as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge;

indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party, promptly after the indemnified party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the indemnified party relating to the Third Party Claim.
(b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the indemnifying party; , , that such counsel is not reasonably objected to by the indemnified party. Should the indemnifying party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof. If the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel (not reasonably objected to by the indemnifying party), at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense. The indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified party for any period during which the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense thereof (other than during the period prior to the time the indemnified party shall have given notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above).

(c) If the indemnifying party so elects to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, all of the indemnified parties shall cooperate with the indemnifying party in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the indemnifying party's request) the provision to the indemnifying party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not the indemnifying party shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge such Third Party Claim without the indemnifying party's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld.

The failure by any indemnified party so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to such indemnified party under Section 10.01 or 10.02, except to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates that it has been prejudiced by such failure. If the indemnifying party disputes its liability with respect to such claim, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction.

Exhibit 99.1

ConvaTec is a world leader in the development and marketing of innovative wound therapeutics and ostomy care products.
"In December 2007, we announced our evolution into the leading next-generation BioPharma company and that as part of the transformation we would undergo a thorough strategic review of our non-pharmaceutical assets," said James M. Cornelius, chairman and chief executive officer, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. "Since then, we have announced the sale of Medical Imaging, the proposed carve-out initial public offering of Mead Johnson and the sale of ConvaTec.
"These decisions support our next-generation BioPharma strategy. We will now have additional financial resources to expedite that strategy as we continue to work to help patients prevail over serious diseases."
Dave Johnson, who will remain the CEO of ConvaTec, said, "I am excited to partner with Nordic Capital and Avista Capital Partners as we transition ConvaTec to a stand-alone company. Both firms have a proven track record of success in the healthcare industry. They are passionate believers in ConvaTec's future growth and will be strong supporters of the ConvaTec business. Their deep experience in guiding strategy and backing companies will help take ConvaTec to the next level of success as an independent company."
The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and delivery of ConvaTec's audited 2007 financial statements. The closing is anticipated in the third quarter of 2008.
Nordic Capital and funds associated with Avista have severally guaranteed the obligations of the newly formed purchaser under the purchase agreement. The purchaser has entered into a fully committed loan agreement which provides for funding by the lenders with no material conditions other than the conditions under the purchase agreement and customary conditions relating to the delivery of closing documents and financial information as well as conditions related to the status of the purchaser.
