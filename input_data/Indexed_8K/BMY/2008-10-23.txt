(NEW YORK, October 23, 2008)  Consistent with recent performance, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) today reported strong sales growth and earnings performance for the third quarter 2008.
"Bristol-Myers Squibb continues to deliver excellent operating results. With double-digit sales growth in the third quarter and with strong financial results for the first nine months of 2008, we are refining our 2008 non-GAAP earnings-per-share guidance to be between $1.65 to $1.70, which is the upper range of our prior guidance" said James M. Cornelius, chairman and chief executive officer.
"Our recent success gives us confidence that our BioPharma strategy is the right one to help us fulfill our commitments to patients and shareholders," Cornelius added. "As we continue to demonstrate strong performance in the marketplace, we're moving forward to attain our goals, both commercially and with the advancement of our new product pipeline. The strength of our balance sheet and cash position enables us to execute our strategy, including our ongoing business development activity."

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT UPDATE
Eli Lilly commenced a tender offer to acquire ImClone on October 14, 2008. Based on Bristol-Myers Squibb's ownership of 14.4 million shares of ImClone, the company expects to receive approximately $1.0 billion in cash upon the closing of the transaction. Bristol-Myers Squibb continues to have long-term marketing rights to ERBITUX in the U.S. and Canada and believes it has rights to ImClone's investigational compound IMC-11F8.
The company is executing on its strategic priorities for its healthcare group. On August 1, the company announced that it had completed the divestiture of the ConvaTec business unit to Nordic Capital Fund VII and Avista Capital Partners. On September 25, the company announced that Mead Johnson Nutrition Company had filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering of its Class A common stock.
Bristol-Myers Squibb is focusing on supplementing its internal research and development portfolio with strategic partnerships and acquisitions. In August, the company announced a global alliance with PDL BioPharma to develop and commercialize elotuzumab, an anti-CS1 antibody currently in Phase I development for multiple myeloma.
NEW PRODUCT PIPELINE UPDATE
Bristol-Myers Squibb and its partner AstraZeneca announced on July 23 that the regulatory submissions for ONGLYZA (saxagliptin) were made in both the United States and in Europe on June 30 and July 1, respectively. On September 2, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced it had accepted the filing.
The following regulatory and data milestones occurred in the third quarter or in October:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2008 GUIDANCE
Bristol-Myers Squibb is raising its 2008 earnings guidance for fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations on a GAAP basis to between $1.61 and $1.66, reflecting an estimated $900 million pre-tax gain ($0.29 per share after tax) from Eli Lilly's acceptance of the company's tender of its ImClone shares. If the company does not receive such cash from the tender, the company expects to lower 2008 guidance on a GAAP basis to between $1.32 to $1.37 per share. The company is also refining its 2008 fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance on a non-GAAP basis to be between $1.65 and $1.70, which is the upper end of its previous guidance. The non-GAAP guidance excludes specified items as discussed under "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information." Details reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP bases are provided in supplemental materials available on the company's website.
The company reaffirms guidance that it expects non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations to grow at a minimum of 15 percent compounded annual growth rate, from the 2007 base through 2010 without rebasing for the agreement to sell the ConvaTec business, excluding costs associated with the Productivity Transformation Initiative and other specified items that have not yet been identified and quantified.
The non-GAAP 2008 guidance and the three-year compound annual growth rate exclude other specified items such as gains or losses from sale of businesses and product lines; from sale of equity investments and from discontinuations of operations; restructuring and other exit costs; accelerated depreciation charges; asset impairments; charges and recoveries relating to significant legal proceedings; upfront and milestone payments for licensing arrangements; payments for in-process research and development; debt retirement costs; impairments to investments; and significant tax events.
The financial guidance for 2008 and the three-year compound annual growth rate exclude the impact of any potential strategic acquisitions and divestitures and further assume that the company and its product partner, sanofi-aventis, maintain U.S. exclusivity for the PLAVIX patent through at least 2010.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
This press release contains non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share information, adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other
 
specified items. Among the items in GAAP measures but excluded for purposes of determining adjusted earnings and other adjusted measures are: charges related to implementation of the Productivity Transformation Initiative and the company's strategy for Mead Johnson Nutritionals; gains or losses from sale and leaseback of properties and from discontinuations of operations; restructuring and other exit costs; accelerated depreciation charges; asset impairments; charges relating to significant legal proceedings; upfront and milestone payments for in-licensing of products that have not achieved regulatory approval that are immediately expensed; payments for in-process research and development; impairments to investments; and significant tax events. This information is intended to enhance an investor's overall understanding of the company's past financial performance and prospects for the future. For example, non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share information is an indication of the company's baseline performance before items that are considered by the company to be not reflective of the company's ongoing results. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators the company uses as a basis for evaluating company performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting of future periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted earnings per share prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Gross Margin/Research and Development/Marketing, Selling and Administrative/Tax Rate Projections Excluding Specified Items
Gross margin on a GAAP basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was 68.2%, which included specified items of $207 million and had a 1.4% adverse impact on gross margin in aggregate. On a non-GAAP basis, for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 gross margin was 69.6%. On a non-GAAP basis, based on historical trends in 2007 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 the Company projects gross margin for the full year 2008 to increase approximately 100 basis points compared to 2007, and continued improvement in its pharmaceutical margins for 2008 to 2010 driven by rationalization of its manufacturing network. There is no reasonably accessible or reliable comparable GAAP measure for this forward-looking information on gross margin. See GAAP to Non-GAAP PL Reconciliation - September YTD tab.
Research and development expenses on a GAAP basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 were $2,474 million, which included specified items of $120 million. On a non-GAAP basis, for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 research and development expenses were $2,354 million. On a non-GAAP basis, based on historical trends in 2007 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 the Company projects research and development expenses for the full year 2008 to increase in the mid single digit range compared to 2007. The Company projects 2008 to 2010 growth to also be in the mid single digit range. There is no reasonably accessible or reliable comparable GAAP measure for this forward-looking information on research and development. See GAAP to Non-GAAP PL Reconciliation - September YTD tab.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses, on a GAAP basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 were $3,507 million, which included specified items of $74 million. On a non-GAAP basis, for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 marketing, selling and administrative expenses were $3,433 million. On a non-GAAP basis, based on historical trends in 2007 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 the Company projects marketing, selling and administrative expenses, for the full year 2008 to be flat compared to 2007, and remain flat from 2008 to 2010. There is no reasonably accessible or reliable comparable GAAP measure for this forward-looking information on marketing, selling and administrative expense. See GAAP to Non-GAAP PL Reconciliation - September YTD tab.
The effective tax rate on a GAAP basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was 25.0%, which included specified items of $154 million in the tax provision, and had a .8% adverse impact on the effective tax rate in aggregate. On a non-GAAP basis, for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 effective tax rate was 24.2%. On a non-GAAP basis, based on historical trends in 2007 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 the Company projects effective tax rate for the full year 2008 to increase to approximately 24%. The Company projects the effective tax rate for 2009 and 2010 to increase from 2008 levels. There is no reasonably accessible or reliable comparable GAAP measure for this forward-looking information on the tax rate. See GAAP to Non-GAAP PL Reconciliation - September YTD tab.
The GAAP results for the full year 2008 would include specified items that may occur and impact results, including restructuring and other charges related to implementation of the Productivity Transformation Initiative. The productivity initiative, announced in December 2007 is expected to generate approximately $1.5 billion in cost reductions and avoidance on a pre-tax basis versus the Company's previous strategic plan for 2010. Costs associated with this Productivity Transformation Initiative are estimated to be between $0.9 billion to $1.1 billion on a pre-tax basis, with approximately $500 million expected to be incurred in 2008. Costs associated with the expansion of the Productivity Transformation Initiative announced in July 2008, which is expected to generate an additional $1.0 billion in cost savings, are not estimable at this point. The ultimate timing of the recording of the charges cannot be predicted with certainty and will be affected by the occurrence of triggering events for expense recognition under GAAP, among other factors. The GAAP results for the full year 2008 could also include charges and recoveries relating to significant legal proceedings, debt retirement costs and other charges related to new transactions, upfront and milestone payments, copromotion or alliance charges and charges for in-process research and development related to new external development transactions, gains or losses from asset disposals, other restructuring activities, impairments to marketable securities and significant tax events. For a fuller discussion of certain of the litigation and other matters that could impact full year GAAP results, as well as the use of non-GAAP financial information, see Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Reports Financial Results For The Third Quarter of 2008, October 23, 2008, including "2008 Guidance" and "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information" therein.
On a non-GAAP basis, the Company projects 2008-10 compounded growth rate in earnings per share from continuing operations to be at least 15% compared to 2007 without rebasing 2007 for the agreement to sell the ConvaTec business. There is no reasonably accessible or reliable comparable GAAP measure for this forward-looking information on earnings per share.
