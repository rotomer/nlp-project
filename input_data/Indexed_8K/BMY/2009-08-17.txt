2. BACKGROUND AND SCOPE OF COLLABORATION
Through years of extensive and costly research and development, Otsuka has developed the Compound, which it believes can be developed into Product having considerable worldwide commercial and therapeutic potential. Recognizing the high cost and complexity of necessary further development, and the significant accompanying commercial risks, Otsuka has concluded that, in order to achieve the full potential of the Compound and Product, it is necessary to collaborate with another company. BMS has
 
* CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED. CONFIDENTIAL PORTION HAS BEEN FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
considerable experience developing, obtaining regulatory approval of and commercializing prescription drugs worldwide, and BMS shares Otsuka's views as to the commercial and therapeutic potential of the Compound and Product.
Accordingly, as provided in this Agreement, Otsuka and BMS agree to collaborate on the continued development and Commercialization of Product. The parties believe this collaboration, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, is essential to achieve the goal of completing the development of Product and making it available to customers throughout the Territory at the earliest possible time. The parties hope to achieve commercial success through this collaboration, and they also believe that this collaboration will be to the benefit of human health worldwide.
As described in detail in this Agreement, Otsuka hereby retains BMS, as a contract service provider on behalf of Otsuka in the United States and the European Union, to continue the development of Product in collaboration with Otsuka and to Commercialize the Product in collaboration with Otsuka. Otsuka or its Affiliates will be the holder of the Product NDA in the United States and the MA(s) in the European Union, and, to the maximum extent permissible, BMS will Commercialize Product in the United States and the European Union on behalf of Otsuka, under Otsuka Trademark(s), recording Product sales in the name of Otsuka or its Affiliates. Otsuka retains the option to Co-Promote Product in the United States and the other Co-Promotion Countries in the European Union. Otsuka also retains the Reserved Territory for its Commercialization.
As provided below, BMS has an exclusive license to Commercialize Product in the Rest of Territory (countries in the Territory outside the United States and the European Union).

4.1.1 .
Formation of the PDC
Immediately after the Effective Date, BMS and Otsuka formed a Product Development Committee (the "PDC"), which committee shall coordinate, oversee and direct the development efforts and related regulatory matters for Product throughout the Territory and the parties' efforts and activities in connection therewith. It is intended that each party have equal status, representation and decisionmaking power with respect to all PDC matters.
4.1.2 .
PDC Composition and Governance
Each party shall have equal representation and participation on the PDC. Each party shall have (in its discretion) up to seven (7) members on the PDC, shall designate members on the PDC in writing, and shall promptly advise the other party if it substitutes
 
* CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED. CONFIDENTIAL PORTION HAS BEEN FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
any of its members. If one or more members of the PDC are unable to attend by a meeting, the party that appointed the non-attending member or members may designate a substitute or substitutes, as the case may be, to serve in place of the absent member or members. The parties shall each be entitled to cause such other representatives as they may deem necessary or appropriate to attend and participate in PDC meetings from time to time.
The PDC shall be co-chaired by an Otsuka member and a BMS member (each a "Co-Chair") designated by the respective parties. All decisions of the PDC shall be approved in writing by both Co-Chairs. All decisions shall require the unanimous, affirmative vote of the parties, with each party entitled to one vote on the PDC regardless of the number of members attending the meeting. Each party's vote shall be cast by its Co-Chair or the Co-Chair's designee. In the event that the parties fail to reach a unanimous decision on any issue before the PDC, the issue shall be referred to and resolved as quickly as reasonably possible by the joint decision of the respective heads of the parties' research and development divisions (currently Mr. Kazuhiro Tomita in the case of Otsuka, and Dr. Peter S. Ringrose in the case of BMS); disagreements not resolved at that level shall be referred to and resolved in accordance with Section 14.
The PDC shall establish such PDC subcommittees as it deems appropriate to address the issues falling within its purview, such subcommittees to have equal representation and participation by both parties, with the same governance as described above (each party to appoint a Co-Chair; each Co-Chair to have one vote; decisions to be unanimous, failing which they shall be referred up to the PDC). The PDC shall coordinate closely with the JCC, including (without limitation) with respect to studies to be conducted under the authority of the PDC deemed by the JCC to be advisable to optimize the commercialization of Product.
4.1.3 .
Meetings
The PDC shall meet as frequently as either party may reasonably request and at such times and places as they select but, in any event, at least twice yearly throughout the term of this Agreement (unless the parties mutually agree that no further meetings are necessary). Unless the Co-Chairs agree otherwise in writing, the location of meetings of the PDC shall alternate between the offices of BMS and the offices of Otsuka, with the first meeting to be held at BMS's offices. All costs of participation by each member in the activities of the PDC shall be borne by the party appointing such member. The Co-Chairs shall appoint a secretary who shall maintain the records of the PDC and shall keep minutes of the meetings of the PDC. The records and minutes shall be subject to written ratification by the Co-Chairs, and the secretary shall distribute minutes to all members of the PDC. Any PDC matter may be decided by the Co-Chairs jointly without submission for review by all PDC members.

Responsibilities of the PDC
As provided in Section 4.2, the PDC shall meet promptly after the Effective Date in order to approve a plan (the Product Development Plan) for the rapid and orderly continuation of the development of Product in conformity with all applicable regulatory requirements and for the carrying out of clinical studies to be sponsored by BMS and Otsuka, respectively. The PDC shall be an ongoing, operational committee (and not merely an advisory body) responsible for both decisionmaking and supervision of the implementation of all phases of the development process, including post-marketing development, and all related regulatory matters. The PDC shall have final authority regarding necessary or advisable clinical studies to be conducted in order to optimize the Commercialization of Product, shall review the implementation of the Product Development Plan, and shall discuss and agree upon any additions or modifications to the Product Development Plan. In addition (and without limitation), the PDC shall discuss and agree upon the regulatory approval, including product labeling, for Product in the Territory, related strategies, and any issues or questions raised by any governmental agency or regulatory body in the Territory regarding Product or its development or regulation. Further, the PDC shall discuss and approve plans for, and the status of efforts in connection with, the development of new Product indications and formulations. Without limiting the above, the PDC shall have responsibility for decisionmaking regarding, and supervision of the implementation of new indications and formulations; all pre-launch and post-launch clinical studies (including, without limitation, Phase IIIb and Phase IV studies); pharmacoeconomic studies; registration and ongoing regulatory matters (FDA, DDMAC, EMEA or otherwise); product labeling; and chemistry, manufacture and control (CMC; including specifcations for Compound and Product); but excluding government reimbursement pricing, which shall be the responsibility of the JCC.
4.2. .
Product Development Plan
After the Effective Date, BMS developed a proposed overall, continuing plan for the development, regulatory approval and continuing study of Product in the Territory. BMS submitted a draft of the plan (the Full Development and Commercialization Plan) to the PDC for its consideration, modification as it deemed appropriate, finalization and approval. After such consideration and modification, the PDC approved the plan (as indicated by the written approval of the Co-Chairs of the PDC). The Full Development and Commercialization Plan approved by the PDC is set forth or incorporated by reference in Appendix D and is hereby incorporated into this Agreement (such plan, as it is approved and as it may hereafter be modified and updated by the PDC, is referred to as the "Product Development Plan"). Each party shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to carry out its respective obligations under the Product Development Plan. The Product Development Plan sets forth, and shall continue to set forth, the detailed outlines and timelines of the scientific, medical, clinical, regulatory and other activities to be

(c) to the extent commercially feasible, there will be one Trademark used throughout the United States and the European Union for Product; Otsuka shall own the Trademark(s);

Commercialization Rights and Obligations of BMS
(a) .
Grant of Commercialization Rights
Otsuka hereby grants to BMS, during the term of this Agreement, the exclusive right, subject to the Co-Promotion rights of Otsuka in the Co-Promotion Countries, to Commercialize Product in the United States and the European Union under Otsuka's Trademark(s). During the term of this Agreement, so long as BMS's Commercialization rights remain in effect, neither Otsuka nor an Affiliate of Otsuka will authorize, or grant the right to, any third party (other than, in the case of the Co-Promotion Countries, to Affiliates of Otsuka) to Commercialize Product in such country.
(b) .
Commercialization Obligations of BMS
Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, including the obligations of Otsuka specified in the following sentence, BMS shall be and remain responsible, at its sole cost, for Commercializing Product throughout the United States and the European Union for and on behalf of Otsuka; in doing so, BMS shall-without limiting its diligence obligations under Section 5.10 - implement the strategies, Marketing Plans and other decisions and directives of the JCC. Except for Otsuka's specific obligations with respect to Product development described in Section 4, supply and packaging described in Section 5.11, and the Co-Promotion responsibilities Otsuka may elect to undertake in accordance with Section 5.3.3, BMS shall be obligated to provide - in close collaboration with Otsuka and for and on behalf and in the name, of Otsuka, but at BMS's sole cost and expense - all other services relating to the development, regulatory compliance and Commercialization of Product, including (without limitation): all government mandated reimbursement pricing; forecasting and ordering of Product; inventory management and control; warehousing and distribution of Product; recordation of sales; invoicing; collection of receivables; sales reports; customer relations and services; preparation of advertising and promotional materials and implementation of marketing and promotional activities and strategies; preparation of training materials and conduct of training sessions; pharmacovigilance; post-marketing surveillance (including adverse event reporting); product recall; and response to regulatory and health authority inquiries and investigations.

5.3.3 .
Otsuka's Co-Promotion Option
(a)
Co-Promotion Countries.
Otsuka retains the option, exercisable in its sole discretion, to Co-Promote Product with BMS in the Co-Promotion Countries, which option Otsuka may exercise on a country-by-country basis. In the United States, Otsuka may elect to participate in Co-Promotion by contributing up to [*] sales representatives, regardless of the total number of sales representatives specified in the Marketing Plan for the United States. In each of the Co-Promotion Countries other than the United States, Otsuka may elect to participate in the Co-Promotion of Product by contributing up to [*] of the budgeted sales representatives for such Co-Promotion Country as set forth in the applicable Marketing Plan.
(b)
Otsuka Co-Promotion Election and Commitment.
Not later than eighteen (18) months prior to the date projected by the PDC to be the Product Launch Date in each Co-Promotion Country (on a country-by-country basis), BMS will notify Otsuka in writing of the sales force needs in such country, in accordance with the then-current Marketing Plan for such country approved by the JCC. Not later than the date that is twelve (12) months prior to the PDC's projected Launch Date in such country, or the date that is six (6) months after receipt of BMS's notice of the sales force needs in such country, whichever is later, Otsuka shall decide whether to participate in Co-Promotion of Product in such country at such time. If Otsuka elects to participate in such Co-Promotion, it will concurrently notify BMS in writing of such election and commit to provide a specific number of sales representatives in such country, which number may be any number up to, but not in excess of the limits specified in Section 5.3.3(a) above. Otsuka's commitment to Co-Promote Product in such country shall be for at least three (3) years following the Product Launch Date in such country. Should the Marketing Plan's budgeted number of sales representatives for such country increase or decrease during such three-year period (as determined by the JCC), Otsuka's commitment of sales representatives shall increase or decrease during the three-year period proportionately with the level of its commitment at the outset. If Otsuka elects to participate in Co-Promotion, BMS or its Affiliates shall meet the sales force needs not satisfied by the sales representatives provided by Otsuka.
If Otsuka elects not to participate in Co-Promotion of Product in any Co-Promotion Country at the time of the Product Launch Date in such country, BMS or its Affiliates will provide the entire sales force needs in such country. Otsuka may subsequently, with eighteen (18) months' advance written notice to BMS (or a shorter period with BMS's written consent, which it shall not unreasonably withhold), elect to begin Co-Promoting Product in such country at any time more than three (3) years after the Launch Date in such country. In such case, Otsuka shall notify BMS of such election
 
* CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED. CONFIDENTIAL PORTION HAS BEEN FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
in writing and shall commit to provide a specific number of sales representatives in such country (up to but not in excess of the limits specified in Section 5.3.3(a) above). Otsuka's commitment at such time shall be for at least two (2) years from the date Otsuka commences such Co-Promotion in such country; as provided above, however, should the Marketing Plan's budgeted number of sales representatives for such country increase or decrease during such two-year period, Otsuka' s commitment of sales representatives shall increase or decrease during the two-year period proportionately with the level of its commitment at the outset. Subject to the above, after Otsuka has made a commitment to Co-Promote the Product in a given Co-Promotion Country, it may thereafter, with eighteen (18) months' advance written notice to BMS (or a shorter period with BMS's written consent, which it shall not unreasonably withhold) elect to increase (subject to the limitations specified in Section 5.3.3(a) above), decrease or withdraw its Co-Promotion effort in such country (such change to be effective following expiration of the three-year or two-year commitment period described above). Otsuka's resulting commitment, as so increased, decreased or withdrawn, shall be for at least two (2) years.
If it is legally impermissible for Otsuka to Co-Promote in one or more Co- Promotion countries prior to and on the Launch Date in such country(ies), but it subsequently becomes permissible to Co-Promote, Otsuka may (in its discretion) elect to Co-Promote in such country(ies) at any time after it becomes permissible to do so, following the procedures set forth above (e.g., an initial three-year commitment with twelve (12) month's prior notice, followed by two-year commitments with eighteen (18) month's prior notice).
5.3.4 .
Reimbursement of Otsuka's Sales Force Expenses
BMS will reimburse Otsuka for all of Otsuka's "direct expenses" incurred in connection with the Otsuka sales representatives Otsuka elects to provide to Co-Promote Product, subject to the following (as used in this section, references to "Otsuka" include its Affiliates):
(a) The "direct expenses" for which BMS shall reimburse Otsuka shall be the salary and benefits (including employment taxes) paid or provided to Otsuka's sales representatives, all bonuses and incentive compensation paid to the sales representatives (Otsuka's bonus and incentive compensation plan shall be substantially the same as the bonus and incentive compensation paid by BMS (or its Affiliates) to its sales representatives in the country in question), Product sales-related travel and entertainment expenses, automobile expenses and the costs of Product sales-related materials and supplies. The benefits for which BMS shall reimburse Otsuka shall be limited to the kind and amount of benefits paid by BMS or its Affiliates to or for sales representatives in the same country (and shall exclude benefits not paid or provided in the then-current year but which are
 
* CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED. CONFIDENTIAL PORTION HAS BEEN FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
accrued as a future benefit, such as a severance pay obligation or such other benefit that accrues and becomes payable only in the future).
(b) In the United States, BMS shall reimburse Otsuka for the direct expenses of the actual number Otsuka's sales representatives, but only up to [*] sales representatives; Otsuka shall bear the salaries, costs and expenses for its sales representatives in excess of forty that it elects to provide in the Co-Promotion effort in the United States.
(c) In the Co-Promotion Countries other than the United States, BMS shall reimburse Otsuka for the direct expenses of the actual number of Otsuka sales representatives, but only up to [*]of the total number of sales representatives budgeted in the Marketing Plan for each such country at the time Otsuka committed its sales representatives for that year; Otsuka shall bear the salaries, costs and expenses for its sales representatives in excess of [*] of the budgeted number of sales representatives that it elects to participate in Co-Promotion in such country.
(d) In the event Otsuka elects to commence Co-Promotion at the Launch Date in a given Co-Promotion Country, BMS shall begin reimbursing Otsuka for the direct expenses of Otsuka's sales representatives at the earlier of either (i) six (6) months prior to the Product Launch Date in such country as forecast by the PDC, or (ii) one (1) month prior to the commencement of sales force training should the JCC determine that sales force training for Product promotion should commence more than six months prior to the forecast Launch Date.
(e) In every Co-Promotion Country in which Otsuka's sales representatives promote Product and no other products either from Otsuka or a third party, BMS will reimburse [*] of the direct expenses of such sales representatives (subject to the limitations specified above). It shall be entirely in Otsuka's discretion whether and when its sales representatives promote other products in addition to Product. So long as Otsuka's sales representatives promoting Product promote no other products either from Otsuka or a third party, and BMS is therefore reimbursing [*] of the direct expenses of such representatives (subject to the limitations specified above), BMS may, with reasonable advance notice to Otsuka, require Otsuka to direct those sales representatives whose direct expenses are being reimbursed by BMS to promote one BMS neuroscience product in the Secondary Position in Calls; provided that such BMS product shall be a product with the same detailing target audience as Product, and it shall be a patent-protected product commercially important to BMS that BMS's sales representatives promoting Product in the same country(ies) are also promoting. BMS recognizes it is important that all Otsuka
 
* CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED. CONFIDENTIAL PORTION HAS BEEN FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
sales representatives promoting Product in a country have similar sales incentives. Accordingly, should the number of Otsuka sales representatives Co-Promoting Product exceed the number for which BMS is required to reimburse Otsuka (as permitted by Section 5.3.3(a)), BMS agrees to consider in good faith offering to allow the "non-reimbursed" Otsuka sales representatives to promote the same BMS product; in such case BMS and Otsuka shall discuss and agree upon reasonable compensation to be paid by BMS to Otsuka for the services of such sales representatives in promoting BMS's product.
(f) If Otsuka' s sales representatives promote Product and one or more additional, non-BMS products, BMS will reimburse [*]of the direct expenses of Otsuka's sales representatives (subject to the limitations specified above) for so long as Otsuka's sales representatives promote Product in the Primary Position in Calls.
(g) If Otsuka's sales representatives promote Product in the Secondary Position in Calls, and promote a non-BMS product in the Primary Position, BMS will reimburse [*] of the direct expenses of Otsuka's sales representatives (subject to the limitations specified above).
(h) The parties agree that none of Otsuka's or its Affiliates' sales representatives participating in the Co-Promotion of Product is an employee of BMS or its Affiliates. Such individuals are not eligible to participate in any employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the United States Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA)) sponsored by BMS or its Affiliates. Otsuka specifically agrees that each such individual (i) is engaged solely by Otsuka or its Affiliates and not by BMS or its Affiliates; (ii) will look solely to Otsuka and its Affiliates for any compensation and benefits pertaining to the services provided by such individual; (iii) is not an employee of BMS or its Affiliates; and (iv) is not eligible to participate in any employee benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA, nor any other bonus, stock option, stock purchase, incentive, deferred compensation, supplemental retirement, severance or other similar fringe or employee benefit plan, program or arrangement sponsored at any time by BMS or its Affiliates, even should it subsequently be determined by any court, the Internal Revenue Service or any other governmental agency that such individual may be a common law employee of BMS or its Affiliates.
(i) On a monthly basis, Otsuka shall submit an invoice to BMS for all "direct expenses" to be reimbursed by BMS in accordance with this Section 5.3.4, and BMS shall pay each such invoice within thirty (30) days of its receipt.
 
* CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED. CONFIDENTIAL PORTION HAS BEEN FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
5.3.5 .
Sales Team Assignments
Each party shall deploy its sales force in accordance with the Marketing Plan applicable to the country in question, but each party shall retain direct supervision of its own sales force, including the power to hire and fire. The assignment of each party's sales force within each Co-Promotion Country will be equitable so that the sales force of each party is assigned valuable, productive accounts and an equitable share of responsibility for opinion leaders, large accounts and other more desirable accounts. Both BMS and Otsuka sales representatives will be assigned to cover office-based psychiatrists and psychiatric hospitals. Otsuka representatives will be geographically dispersed in each Co-Promotion Country so as to have equitable representation with the BMS sales representatives in the most productive areas of each such country, based on analysis of prescriber profiles. In geographic areas where both companies have sales representatives, every effort will be made to split the sales targets as equitably as possible. The parties shall attempt to minimize sales force realignments so as not to disrupt representative-to-representative and representative-to-physician relationships. BMS sales representatives will cover other sales targets, including teaching hospitals and influential medical centers, military/veteran accounts, government agencies, long-term care and prisons. BMS will take the lead with respect to managed care organizations, but will give Otsuka meaningful opportunities for collaborative efforts in managing key managed care accounts. BMS's Medical Science Managers will provide support as needed to secure formulary approval and/or support product acceptance in key institutions. Both BMS and Otsuka representatives may utilize the Medical Science Managers as appropriate. On a monthly basis, each party shall submit to the JCC a detailed written report describing its detailing and promotional activities during the preceding month, on a country-by-country basis.
5.3.6 .
Training
BMS will prepare for and hold, at its expense, Product promotion training programs prior to and periodically after the Launch Date in each country to ensure the sales forces are adequately trained. Members of the sales forces of Otsuka and its Affiliates and, in Otsuka's discretion, their sales force trainers, may attend all such Product-related training programs at no cost, and BMS shall provide such attendees with copies of all BMS training materials at no cost. BMS shall bear the costs and expenses of the training programs, facilities, personnel, services and materials. Otsuka and its Affiliates may, in their discretion, provide additional training, using their own trainers, at their cost and expense. Otsuka and its Affiliates shall have the royalty-free right to reproduce, distribute and otherwise use throughout the world all Product-related training materials prepared by BMS, during and after the term of this Agreement.

5.3.7 .
Effective Co-Promotion Practices
Otsuka and BMS, and their respective Affiliates, shall cooperate to employ and implement effective Co-Promotion practices. Such cooperation shall include the development of a clear understanding of the marketing roles and responsibilities of each party in each Co-Promotion Country and the establishment of effective communications systems and processes to ensure that the promotional activities of the parties' sales forces are efficient, coordinated and productive.
5.3.8 .
Exchange of Marketing Information
BMS will develop and maintain current Call lists, schedules, and other appropriate information for the purpose of determining the psychiatrists and other persons involved in the drug purchase decisionmaking process to whom the BMS and Otsuka sales forces may detail Product, and it shall share such information with Otsuka. Otsuka and its Affiliates shall have the right to reproduce, distribute and otherwise use such information free of charge during and after the term of this Agreement.
5.3.9 .
Booking of Sales; Distribution of Product; Collection of Receivables; Option of Otsuka to Assume Services
In the United States and throughout the European Union, including in the Co-Promotion Countries, BMS shall provide, at its expense, all services relating to the recordation of completion of and accounting for Product sales, including (without limitation) Product warehousing and distribution, inventory control and management, the receipt and entry of all orders - all of which shall be accounted for, billed and booked in the name of Otsuka or its Affiliates unless Otsuka elects, in its sole discretion, to have BMS book sales in its name in a given country or countries - invoicing, collection of receivables, handling of Product returns and customer and professional relations. BMS shall provide weekly or monthly reports (as the parties shall mutually agree) to Otsuka stating sales in the United States and the European Union in the prior week or month, as the case may be. To the extent that Otsuka or its Affiliates have, or can procure by subcontracting, the requisite facilities, infrastructure and personnel, Otsuka shall have the option, in its discretion (at its sole cost and expense), to assume responsibility for one or more of such services being provided by BMS (on a country-by-country basis), without altering the financial relationship between the parties unless they otherwise mutually agree in writing. If Otsuka elects to assume responsibility for one or more such services, BMS shall cooperate with Otsuka in the transition of responsibility for such service to Otsuka so as to avoid any disruption or delay in the provision of such service during such transition.

5.3.10.
Countries Added to or Removed from the European Union
In the event one or more countries are added to the European Union during the term of this Agreement, the parties shall attempt, to the extent legally permissible and commercially practicable, to treat each such country like all other members of the European Union are treated under this Agreement; that is, BMS to Commercialize Product at its sole expense in such country on behalf of Otsuka, booking sales in the name of Otsuka or Otsuka' s Affiliate (unless Otsuka has elected otherwise), in exchange for the compensation provided in Section 5.9.1. In the event that one or more countries are removed from the European Union during the term of this Agreement, the parties shall attempt, to the extent legally permissible and commercially practicable, to continue to Commercialize the Product in each such country on the same terms and conditions as had prevailed with respect to such country prior to its removal from the European Union (that is, BMS to Commercialize Product at its sole expense in such country, booking sales in the name of Otsuka or Otsuka's Affiliate (unless Otsuka has elected otherwise), in exchange for the compensation specified above; Otsuka to have the option to Co-Promote the Product in such country if it is a Co-Promotion Country). If such Commercialization of Product in a country added to or removed from the European Union is not legally permissible or commercially practicable on such terms, the parties shall discuss and agree upon alternate terms and conditions for Commercialization as close as reasonably and legally possible to such terms and conditions, from a commercial and financial perspective.
5.3.11 .
Reimbursement Price Negotiations
Where applicable, BMS shall endeavor to obtain prompt reimbursement approval for Product throughout the Territory. To the extent legally permissible, BMS will have responsibility for and (as between BMS and Otsuka) control of reimbursement price negotiations in the European Union, such reimbursement price negotiations to be under the direction of the JCC and in close collaboration with Otsuka (as provided in Section 5.7). BMS will keep Otsuka fully and promptly informed as to the status of all such reimbursement price negotiations; BMS will consult with Otsuka prior to engaging in such negotiations with respect to the positions to be taken; and Otsuka will have the opportunity to participate with BMS in all meetings with authorities pertaining to such reimbursement price negotiations. To the extent legally permissible and practicable, the holder of the MA in the European Union (Otsuka or its Affiliate) shall afford BMS or its Affiliate a legal role and standing to act in Otsuka's (or its Affiliate's) name in such reimbursement price negotiations, with Otsuka's full participation. If any aspect of this provision is deemed legally impermissible, the parties shall promptly amend this provision and reassign responsibility for reimbursement price negotiations, so that they and this Agreement are in full compliance with applicable law.

5.3.12.
Distribution Alternative
In certain countries in the European Union, it may be legally impermissible or commercially impractical for BMS to Commercialize Product and record Product sales in Otsuka's or its Affiliates' name. In such countries Otsuka may elect, in its sole discretion, that BMS's Affiliate shall act as an exclusive distributor (the "Distributor") of Product, in which case such Distributor shall record Product sales in such country(ies) in its own name, or some other Commercialization alternative mutually agreeable to the parties. In such event, the Purchase Price for Product to be paid by Distributor to Otsuka (or its Affiliates) for Product that Distributor purchases from Otsuka or its Affiliates for sale in such country(ies) shall be as provided in Section 5.11.2(a)(2). In the event Otsuka elects that BMS's Affiliate shall act as a Distributor of Product in any country(ies), the parties shall adjust their collaborative efforts on the JCC and otherwise in connection with Commercialization of Product in such country(ies) to ensure that they are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in such country. Without limiting the foregoing, BMS's Affiliate, as a Distributor of Product in such country(ies), shall be solely responsible for determining the price at which it elects to sell Product in such country(ies), though the JCC may (but only to the extent legally permissible) recommend but not impose a suggested price. Should Otsuka elect to appoint BMS's Affiliate as a Distributor in any country(ies) of the European Union, and should it thereafter become legally permissible in such country(ies) for BMS to Commercialize Product and record Product sales in the name of Otsuka or its Affiliate(s), Otsuka may (in its discretion) terminate BMS's Affiliate's distributorship, in which case BMS's Commercialization rights and obligations under this Agreement in such country(ies) shall thereafter be the same as in the other countries in the European Union.

Payments of Amounts Due
Following the Restated Agreement Date, the parties shall discuss and agree upon reasonable procedures for collecting, depositing and disbursing Product sales proceeds, which procedures shall be consistent with the overall structure of this Agreement and shall be subject to modification from time to time by mutual written agreement of Otsuka and BMS. In determining such procedures, the parties' goal shall be to disburse Net Sales proceeds in accordance with Section 5.9.1 so that such proceeds are disbursed to the parties in such a way that neither party earns interest on the other party's share. BMS/BMSLC shall also pay Otsuka royalties due on Net Sales in the United States under Section 5.9.2(b) at the same time(s) BMS, as contract service provider to Otsuka, disburses United States Net Sales proceeds to Otsuka.
The fees and Net Sales proceeds remittances due pursuant to Section 5.9.1, royalty payments due pursuant to Section 5.9.2, Compound Purchase Price payments due pursuant to Section 5.11.2 and the Otsuka-BMS Compound Supply Agreement, the Global Floor Price-Based Adjustment pursuant to Section 5.11.3, Product Purchase Price payments due pursuant to Section 5.11.2 and the BMS-OAPI Product Supply Agreement, and, for each BMS Affiliate acting as a Distributor pursuant to Section 5.3.12, payments by such Distributor for Product purchased by it from Otsuka or its Affiliates, shall all be paid and disbursed in accordance with the procedures agreed upon by the parties and consistent with the overall structure of this Agreement. Such payments shall be reconciled and settled on a calendar quarter-by-calendar quarter basis (provided that, in Otsuka's discretion, the reconciliation of the Compound Purchase Price and the Global Floor Price-Based Adjustment may be done annually rather than quarterly). The first "quarter" shall commence on the earlier of (i) the First Commercial Sale of Product anywhere in the Territory, (ii) the first placement of an order for Compound under the Otsuka-BMS Supply Agreement, or (iii) the first placement of an order for Product by a BMS Affiliate or Distributor, and shall end on the last day of the calendar quarter in which such event occurs.
BMS shall pay all royalties due on Net Sales in the Rest Territory on a quarterly basis as provided in Section 5.9.4. BMS (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates acting as Distributors) shall, within fifty (50) days of the receipt of each invoice for Product sold to Distributors in the European Union (which shall be issued no earlier than the dispatch of the shipment), pay all such invoices from Otsuka, Otsuka's Affiliates or its designee, as the case may be, by wire transfer to the bank account designated by Otsuka, Otsuka's Affiliates or its designee.
 
* CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED. CONFIDENTIAL PORTION HAS BEEN FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
In the event BMS fails to make any payments when due, such payments shall accrue interest at the rate of [*] per annum or the maximum amount permitted by law, whichever is less.
5.9.4 .
Quarterly Royalty Payments
In respect of Net Sales in all countries in the Rest of Territory, BMS shall, in accordance with Sections 5.9.2 and 5.9.3, be obligated to Otsuka with respect to payment of royalties on all Net Sales of Product by BMS and its Affiliates and Sublicensees, such payments being due each calendar quarter within sixty (60) days of the end of each such quarter. Each royalty payment shall be made in accordance with Section 5.9.6 and shall be accompanied by a report as described in Section 5.9.8.
BMS shall pay Otsuka, in a single, consolidated payment, all royalties due on Net Sales in the Rest of Territory in a given calendar quarter, such payment to be in United States Dollars. For purposes of calculating the amount of such royalties due, sales of Product made in currencies other than United States Dollars shall be converted to United States Dollars on the basis of BMS's customary internal corporate monthly exchange rates (as described in Section 5.9.8) for the last month of the calendar quarter for which remittance is made.
5.9.5 .
Certain Minimum Payments
Without limiting its royalty obligations as set forth in Section 5.9.2, BMS shall pay Otsuka minimum payments (including payments for royalties and Compound) in respect of Net Sales in the Rest of Territory during each Year of the Royalty Term as follows:
(a) First Year: [*];
(b) Second Year: [*];
(c) Third Year: [*];
(d) Fourth Year: [*]; and
(e) Fifth Year: [*].
 
* CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED. CONFIDENTIAL PORTION HAS BEEN FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
As used in this Section 5.9.5, each "Year" shall be determined as follows: the "First Year" shall mean (a) the period beginning on the First Commercial Sale of Product in Canada or Australia, whichever country where the First Commercial Sale occurs later, through the last day of the calendar quarter in which such First Commercial Sale occurs, plus (b) the three (3) calendar quarters immediately thereafter. The Second Year shall be the next four (4) calendar quarters following the First Year, and so on.
Notwithstanding the above, BMS's obligation under this Section 5.9.5 to make the minimum payments shall cease when both of the following occur with respect to either Canada or Australia: (i) there ceases to be a Valid Claim covering Product being sold in such country, and (ii) the First Commercial Sale in the same country by another company (which shall be neither an Affiliate nor Sublicensee of BMS) of any generic human pharmaceutical product containing Compound or Compound Form as an active ingredient. In such case, BMS shall make the minimum payment for the Year in which its minimum royalty obligation ceases, the amount of the minimum payment obligation to be determined as set forth above, but prorated to reflect the abbreviated Year.
With respect to a given Year, in the event that [*] of the Net Sales in the Rest of Territory for such Year (the "Reference Amount") does not equal or exceed the above minimum payment obligation for such Year, BMS shall, within sixty (60) days of the end of such Year, either pay the difference between the Reference Amount for such Year and the minimum payment due under this Section 5.9.5 for such Year, or BMS's license in the Rest of Territory shall automatically be terminated, notwithstanding Section 5.4.
All payments from either party to the other shall be in United States Dollars or, in lieu thereof, in Japanese yen, Euros or pounds sterling, as the recipient party, in its discretion, shall specify in writing to the paying party. The paying party shall make all payments by wire transfer to the recipient party's designated bank account. Payments in yen or such currency other than U.S. Dollars as the recipient party shall designate shall be in the amount equivalent to the U.S. Dollar amount of the related payment at the applicable exchange rate (the spot rate of the bank making the payment) prevailing on the date of remittance of the payment by the paying party. In the event that the paying party fails to make any payments when due, such payments shall accrue interest at the rate of [*] per annum or the maximum amount permitted by law, whichever is less. The parties contemplate that all payment obligations due at the same time will be consolidated into a single, lump-sum payment between the parties (with the accompanying report allocating such payment among the various Affiliates as appropriate);, the parties may agree that payments in respect of Net Sales in the United States and European Union, on a country-by-country basis, be made by the local Affiliate of the paying party and to the local Affiliate of the recipient party, in each case as the paying party and the recipient party may elect, in which case the paying party shall remain liable to the recipient party for the full payment.

General
The fundamental objective of this Agreement is to optimize the sales potential of Product throughout the Territory and to promote the therapeutic profile and benefits of Product in the most appropriate commercially rewarding manner consistent with the appropriate labeling of Product. In furtherance of this objective, BMS agrees to, and shall, use all commercially reasonable efforts to develop and perform appropriate clinical studies for Product, obtain and maintain regulatory approvals (including pricing and reimbursement listings) for the marketing of Product throughout the Territory, develop new Product indications and formulations, and Commercialize Product throughout the Territory. Another important objective of this Agreement is to increase the prominence, profile and reputation of Otsuka and its Affiliates in the United States and Europe. In
 
* CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED. CONFIDENTIAL PORTION HAS BEEN FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
performing its obligations under this Agreement, BMS shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations throughout the Territory.
BMS will conduct with due diligence and all commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with the objective of this Agreement as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph and otherwise in accordance with this Agreement, at its sole risk and expense (except for Otsuka's undertakings hereunder with respect to the Otsuka Clinical Studies), all Product development work and regulatory activities required to obtain and maintain marketing approval in each country of the Territory, and any and all additional Product development work (including Phase IIIb and Phase IV studies) that may be necessary or desirable for the optimal Commercialization of Product. In addition, and at its sole expense, BMS will diligently use all commercially reasonable efforts, through further research and development, to develop new Product indications (including, without limitation, bipolar disorder) and formulations (such as IM, Depot, etc.), to the extent supportable by scientific and clinical data and information, appropriate or desirable for the optimal Commercialization of Product.

5.10.4.
No Undue Delay
BMS shall commence marketing Product in any country of the Territory within three (3) months of obtaining regulatory approval and (as necessary) full reimbursement or other pricing approval in that country. If BMS fails to commence marketing of Product in any country within such time period, unless such failure is caused by Otsuka's failure to supply Compound, Bulk Tablets or Product, as the case may be, to BMS in a timely fashion - the parties will immediately meet to discuss the reason(s) for such delay and agree upon measures and a Schedule to remedy the situation. If the parties do not, within a reasonable period of time, agree upon measures to remedy the situation and promptly commence marketing in such country, Otsuka may, in its discretion, remove such country from the Territory;, if such country is the United States or if two (2) such countries are in the European Union, Otsuka may, in its discretion, either remove such country(ies) from the Territory or terminate this Agreement as a whole, in either case, such action shall be effective on thirty (30) days' written notice to BMS. In such case, this Agreement shall be deemed terminated with respect to such country or as a whole, as the case may be, and the provisions of Sections 12.3, 12.7 and 13 shall apply. In the event that Otsuka removes one or more countries in the European Union pursuant to this Section 5.10.4, BMS may, in its discretion, within ninety (90) days of its receipt of Otsuka's decision, remove the European Union as a whole (but not in part) from the Territory on thirty (30) days' written notice to Otsuka. In such case, the Agreement shall be deemed terminated with respect to the entire European Union, and the provisions of Section 12.3, 12.7 and 13 shall apply.
provide that
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, if BMS fails to commence marketing Product within the above-specified time period due to government-imposed pricing or reimbursement constraints that the JCC reasonably determines would have a substantial adverse effect on its pricing and optimal Commercialization of Product elsewhere in the Territory, the parties shall meet to discuss the situation. Unless the JCC's determination can be shown to have been commercially unreasonable, through dispute resolution if necessary in accordance with Section 14, Otsuka may not remove such country from the Territory on the basis of BMS's failure to commence marketing of Product in such country in timely fashion.

(2) notwithstanding clause (1) above, Otsuka retains the option to manufacture such Product, at its own cost and expense.
When, as and if BMS's Affiliates are acting as Distributor in any country or countries in the European Union (pursuant to Section 5.3.12), Otsuka or its Affiliates shall supply to such BMS Affiliates, and such BMS Affiliates shall purchase exclusively from them (at the Purchase Price as provided in Section 5.11.2), any and all of their requirements of Product for resale in such country or countries.
(b) During the term of this Agreement, for the Purchase Price set forth in Section 5.11.2(a)(1), Otsuka or its designee shall manufacture for and supply to BMS, its Affiliates and Sublicensees, and BMS, its Affiliates and Sublicensees shall purchase exclusively from Otsuka, any and all of their requirements of Compound. Such requirements include commercial requirements for all Product to be sold in the United States (which shall be for the account of Otsuka or its Affiliate) and the Rest of Territory and development and other noncommercial requirements, if any, in excess of those provided by Otsuka pursuant to Section 4.4. The parties' respective obligations regarding the supply and purchase of Compound shall be set forth in the "Otsuka-BMS Compound Supply Agreement," described in Section 5.11.5 below.
For the sake of clarification, with respect to all commercial requirements in the United States and the Rest of Territory, BMS, its Affiliates and Sublicensees shall be responsible for formulating (in Bulk Tablet formulation and all other formulations) through packaging, at their expense, Product, and Otsuka shall have no obligation to manufacture the Compound into any form of Product.

shipping (including customs duties, if any) and insurance expenses incurred in connection with the shipping of Compound, Bulk Tablets and Product from Japan to the places of formulation, packaging or warehousing and then to the points of distribution throughout the United States and the European Union. BMS shall also bear directly, or reimburse Otsuka for, all out-of-pocket shipping and insurance costs incurred in connection with the shipping of Compound to be formulated into Product for the Rest of the Territory.
(d) Unless the parties mutually agree otherwise in writing, Otsuka shall maintain a rolling inventory of Compound equal to at least three (3) times BMS's firm order for the then most current quarter.
(e) Where BMS is toll manufacturer of Product for Otsuka in the European Union, as provided in Subparagraph (a) above, and where BMS is Product supplier to Otsuka for Product sold in the United States, as provided in clause (b) above, Otsuka shall (as provided in Section 5.11.2(c)(1)(A)(ii)) bear the cost of Compound consumed as wastage in the ordinary course of the Product manufacturing process, but only up to [*], and BMS shall bear the cost of any additional wastage (which it shall bear by purchasing Compound from Otsuka in the amount of such additional wastage, at the purchase price to be the Non-Commercial Compound Price for Compound as provided in Section 5.11.2(a)(5)).
(f) With respect to Product in any formulation, other than the Bulk Tablet formulation, that Otsuka desires to sell outside the Territory during the term of this Agreement, or anywhere following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, and if (and only if) BMS is then manufacturing such other formulation in commercial quantities, BMS agrees, as a contract manufacturer for Otsuka (with respect to both formulating and packaging), for a reasonable contract manufacturing charge to be agreed upon by the parties, to convert Compound provided by Otsuka into such Product. Such obligation shall expire one (1) year following the expiration or termination of this Agreement). The contract manufacturing agreement between Otsuka and BMS shall be substantially the same as the agreement described in Section 5.11.1(a)(1) above, except that the parties shall agree upon a commercially reasonable contract manufacturing fee that Otsuka shall pay to BMS for its services, and the reference to the manufacturing agreement described in Section 5.11.1(a)(1) (where BMS bears the cost of certain wastage) shall not imply that BMS shall bear any cost of wastage in such other agreement.

(4) If Otsuka elects to be the supplier of Compound Form or Related Compound, the Purchase Price to be paid by BMS, its Affiliates and Sublicenses to Otsuka therefor shall be as mutually agreed by the parties at the time.
(5) The Purchase Price to be paid by BMS for Compound not sold as Product, including the price to be paid for Compound used for development, clinical trials, post-marketing trials, consumed as wastage or otherwise, shall equal the Non-Commercial Compound Price, to be agreed upon by the parties, subject, however, to the parties' agreement as to the price of Compound for promotional samples as provided in Section 5.8.1.
In each of the above cases except subparagraph (3) above, the Purchase Price shall always be FOB place of manufacture of Compound, Bulk Tablets or Product, as the case may be, with BMS and its Affiliates and Sublicensees to bear all costs from that point. With respect to subparagraph (3) above, the Purchase Price of Product sold by BMS and BMSLC to OAPI shall, for the benefit of Otsuka/OAPI, be FOB place of destination, so that BMS, not OAPI, bears all Product-related

(2) The Quarterly Adjustments pursuant to Subsection (c)(1) above shall be established in U.S. Dollars or other currencies agreed upon by the parties. For this purpose, Net Sales for a calendar quarter realized in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar shall be first converted into U.S. Dollars (or such other currencies as the parties agree upon) on the basis of BMS's customary internal corporate monthly exchange rates for the last month of the calendar quarter in question as provided in Section 5.9.7.
(3) If the aggregate Quarterly Adjustment for any calendar quarter determined as provided in Subsection (c)(1) above shows BMS or its Affiliates owing any amount(s) to Otsuka or its Affiliates, BMS or its Affiliates shall pay Otsuka such amount(s) in U.S. Dollars concurrently with the submission of the related statement referred to therein.
(4) If the aggregate Quarterly Adjustment for any calendar quarter determined as provided in Subsection (c)( 1) above shows Otsuka or its Affiliates owing any amount(s) to BMS or its Affiliates, Otsuka or its Affiliates shall pay BMS such amount(s) in U.S. Dollars within one (1) month of the date of the related statement referred to therein.

(d) If the Global Floor Price-Based Adjustment for any calendar quarter determined as provided in Subsection (c) above is a positive amount, BMS shall pay Otsuka such amount in U.S. Dollars concurrently with the submission of the related statement referred to therein. If otherwise, no payment shall be due from either party to the other party in respect thereof.
5.11.4 .
Packaging
BMS shall procure, and shall bear, at its sole expense, the costs of the packaging of Product in all formulations sold in the United States and the Rest of Territory, and the packaging of Product in all formulations other than Bulk Tablets sold throughout the European Union; provide that, if Otsuka elects (for itself or a designee other than BMS or a BMS Affiliate) to manufacture Bulk Tablets sold in the United States, Otsuka shall bear the cost of packaging such Bulk Tablets so long as Otsuka is then Co-Promoting Product in the United States. Otsuka shall procure the packaging of Product in Bulk Tablet formulation sold in the European Union (if Otsuka elects to contract with a BMS Affiliate for such European packaging services, the terms and conditions of such contract, including an appropriate allocation of responsibility for wastage, shall be separately negotiated on commercially reasonable terms); however, the costs of packaging Product in Bulk Tablet formulation for the European Union (including all shipping, customs and insurance expenses) shall be borne by the parties as follows:

Should Otsuka's direct participation in the legal proceedings be indispensable (i.e., it is not legally permissible for BMS to pursue remedies in Otsuka's name), BMS shall be entitled to request Otsuka, at BMS's expense, to pursue remedies (which request Otsuka shall not unreasonably refuse).

In the event any adverse judgment for monetary liability is imposed on either BMS or Otsuka or both in any such infringement action in favor of a third-party litigant, the burden of all such judgments shall be borne by the parties in the ratio of [*] to [*] (with BMS bearing [*] of such burden), regardless of the name of the party against whom such a monetary liability is imposed.

Should BMS's direct participation in the legal proceedings be indispensable (i.e., it is not legally permissible for Otsuka to pursue remedies in BMS's name), Otsuka shall be entitled to request BMS, at Otsuka's expense, to pursue remedies (which request BMS shall not unreasonably refuse). Otsuka shall promptly reimburse BMS for its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in so participating, although the expenses borne by Otsuka shall not include BMS's internal costs.
BMS shall cooperate with Otsuka in all respects in such action and shall cause any of BMS's and its Affiliate's and Sublicensee's employees and agents to give depositions or testify when requested by Otsuka and make available to Otsuka copies of any and all relevant records, papers, documents, information and specimens, if necessary under an appropriate protective order. Otsuka shall promptly reimburse BMS for its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing such cooperation to Otsuka at Otsuka's request.
In all cases, except where BMS elects, at its expense, to join as a party, Otsuka shall have the sole and exclusive right to control prosecution of such action, and the right to settle and compromise such action or dispute, but with BMS being fully informed and participating in the decisionmaking process. In the event any monetary recovery in connection with such infringement action is obtained, such recovery shall be applied in the following priority: first, to reimburse Otsuka for its total expenses incurred in prosecuting such action, including fling fees, reasonable attorneys' fees, reasonable local counsel fees, expert and other witness fees and all other reasonable costs; second, to reimburse BMS for its total expenses incurred in connection with such action, including filing fees, reasonable attorney's fees, reasonable local counsel fees, expert and other witness fees and all other reasonable costs not previously reimbursed by Otsuka to BMS; and third, the balance to be shared [*] to Otsuka and [*] to BMS.
In the event any adverse judgment for monetary liability is imposed on either BMS or Otsuka or both in any such infringement action in favor of a third-party litigant, the burden of all such judgments shall be bore by the parties in the ratio of [*] to [*] (with Otsuka bearing [*] of such burden), regardless of the name of the party against whom such a monetary liability is imposed.

Termination for BMS Merger
Subject to the limitations set forth below, Otsuka may, with three (3) months' prior written notice to BMS, terminate this Agreement in whole if BMS acquires, is acquired by, or otherwise merges with, a third party and (a) the resulting or surviving entity continues to develop (in a [*]) or market a Comparable Product (as defined below) in the Territory; (b) such Comparable Product came from the research and development portfolio or the marketed product portfolio of such third party; and (c) Otsuka reasonably determines that the marketing of such Comparable Product would be detrimental to the marketing and/or sales of Product. For purposes of this Agreement, "Comparable Product" means any product, other than Product, which (i) in the case of a marketed product, carries an indication approved by an applicable authority which indication is [*], and (ii) in the case of a product in development, is being developed for any indication [*]. BMS shall notify Otsuka in writing, no later than ten (10) Business Days after the consummation of such acquisition or merger, if the resulting or surviving entity has a Comparable Product under development (in [*]) or in the market in the Territory, and shall furnish to Otsuka information Otsuka reasonably requests in order to make an informed decision under this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Otsuka shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 12.6 if both (i) BMS affirmatively states in the aforesaid notice to Otsuka the resulting or surviving entity's intention to discontinue the development or marketing, as the case may be, of the Comparable Product in the Territory and (ii) the resulting or surviving entity in fact, through out-licensing, sale or otherwise, discontinues development or marketing, as the case may be, of such Comparable Product in the Territory within [*] months after the date of consummation of the acquisition or merger in question. Otsuka' s rights hereunder to give notice terminating this Agreement on account of a merger or acquisition affecting BMS shall lapse eight (8) months after the date of consummation of said merger or acquisition or after Otsuka's receipt of the aforesaid notice and the requested information from BMS, whichever occurs later.

For the sake of clarification, an event otherwise giving rise to a milestone payment under Section 3.1 that does not occur until after the termination of the Agreement (either as a whole or as to the United States or the European Union as a whole, as the case may be) shall not create said milestone payment obligation. In addition to the foregoing, the following provisions of this Agreement shall survive expiration or termination of this Agreement, in addition to other provisions that, by their nature or context, logically survive expiration or termination: Sections 3.2, 4.5.3, 4.5.5, 5.9.9, 5.9.10, 6, 9, 10, 11,12.7, 13, 14 and 15.13.

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement as a whole or in part, except as provided below, BMS will cease all display, advertising and use of all Trademarks, shall, if reasonably requested by Otsuka, confirm by executing appropriate documents Otsuka's exclusive right and title to all Trademarks, and will not thereafter use, advertise or display any name, mark or logo that is, or any part of which is, similar to or confusing with Trademark(s) or other designation associated with Product, anywhere in the world or, in the event of partial termination, in the relevant countries.

Upon such a request by Otsuka, BMS and its Affiliates shall continue to provide to Otsuka, following termination, substantially the same goods and services as BMS was obligated to provide prior to termination, so that the level and nature of Commercialization activities by Otsuka and its designee(s) may continue without material interruption during a transition period in that country following the termination of BMS's Commercialization rights. Otsuka shall pay to BMS a commercially reasonable fee for each of the services requested by Otsuka and delivered by BMS hereunder (such fee to be based on the reasonable cost of the services provided, not based on a percentage of Net Sales). In addition to providing such services, BMS and its Affiliates shall cooperate with Otsuka prior to and following termination or expiration of this Agreement to facilitate the smooth transition to Otsuka of all development, regulatory, manufacturing, supply and Commercialization services being provided by BMS and its Affiliates, so as to avoid or minimize any disruption caused by the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

(ii) Pursuant to such right of Otsuka, in all actions, disputes and proceedings involving Patent Rights in the United States, Otsuka shall have the sole and exclusive right to control prosecution of such actions, disputes and proceedings (including the right to select counsel in connection therewith) and shall (notwithstanding Section 8.2.1) have no obligation to keep BMS informed regarding any such actions, disputes or proceedings or the prosecution thereof.

Exhibit 1
Appendix H
(c) . At least three (3) months prior to January 1 of each calendar year during the U.S. Abilify Extension Term, commencing prior to calendar year 2010, the JCC (or an Operational Team designated by the JCC) shall consider, modify as it deems appropriate, and approve by mutual agreement a written plan setting forth the Commercial Operations performance obligations and operating expenses for the upcoming calendar year in the United States (the ""). It is understood by the Parties that BMS will continue to perform all Commercial Operations activities, except that Otsuka shall deploy MRs and MSLs (together with BMS, as set forth herein), and shall perform any other Commercial Operations activities agreed by the JCC (in which case the allocation between the Parties of responsibility for performing a particular item or activity will be set forth in the Annual Commercial Plan). The Annual Commercial Plan shall specify the aggregate number of MRs and MSLs to be deployed by the Parties in the United States and the total minimum detailing requirements to be fulfilled by the Parties in the United States for the upcoming calendar year (the "") and shall include a detailed budget for the operating expenses to be incurred by the Parties (in the aggregate, and also broken down to specific budgets for the individual categories of Commercial Operations covered by the Annual Commercial Plan) in connection with Commercial Operations in the United States for the upcoming calendar year (the "").

If the JCC is unable to agree upon and approve the Annual Commercial Plan for any calendar year during the U.S. Abilify Extension Term, then the Baseline Commercial Plan attached as to this Amendment shall govern the Parties' obligations and the total expense budget with respect to Commercial Operations in the United States for such year, and the aggregate number of MRs and MSLs to be deployed by the Parties in the United States and the total detailing requirements to be fulfilled by the Parties in the United States set forth in the Baseline Commercial Plan shall be deemed to be the Annual Resource Commitment for such calendar year, and the aggregate expense budget set forth in the Baseline Commercial Plan shall be deemed to be the Annual Commercial Expense Budget for such year. From time to time during any such calendar year, the JCC may agree to modify or amend the Annual Resource Commitment and/or the Commercial Expense Budget for such year. Notwithstanding Section 5.1.2 of the Restated Agreement (as amended by this Amendment), neither the BMS Chair nor the Otsuka Chair of the JCC shall have the tie-breaking vote with respect to establishing any Annual Commercial Plan or modifying any Annual Resource Commitment or Commercial Expense Budget, which must be mutually agreed to by Otsuka's Chair and BMS' Chair on the JCC. For the avoidance of doubt, the JCC shall continue to have final authority and responsibility for development of the Marketing Plans in accordance with Section 5.2 of the Restated Agreement, and each Annual Commercial Plan and the Baseline Commercial Plan shall form part of the Marketing Plans for the United States; that, in the event of any inconsistency between the terms of any Marketing Plan and the terms of the Baseline Commercial Plan or any Annual Commercial Plan, the terms of the Baseline Commercial Plan or Annual Commercial Plan (as the case may be) shall govern.

Any such Commercialization of a U.S. Competitive Product prior to [*], in the United States shall constitute a material breach of the Restated Agreement (as amended). For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of the first paragraph of Section 7.1 of the Restated Agreement (pertaining to generic product) continue to apply to BMS and its Affiliates in the United States.
