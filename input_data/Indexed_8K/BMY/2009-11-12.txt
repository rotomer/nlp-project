On November 5, 2009 Mead Johnson Nutrition Company ("MJN"), an indirect subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (the "Company"), issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.50% Notes due 2014 (the "2014 Notes"), $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.90% Notes due 2019 (the "2019 Notes") and $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.90% Notes due 2039 (the "2039 Notes" and, together with the 2014 Notes and the 2019 Notes, the "Notes"). The Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture (the "Base Indenture"), dated as of November 1, 2009, by and between MJN and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture (the "Supplemental Indenture"), dated as of November 5, 2009, by and among MJN, Mead Johnson & Company ("MJC"), a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of MJN, and the Trustee. The Notes were issued in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Prior to the offer, MJC owed approximately $1,744.2 million in aggregate principal amount to a subsidiary of the Company under intercompany notes (the "Intercompany Debt"). MJN used the net proceeds of the offering, which were approximately $1,482.7 million, to partly repay the Intercompany Debt on November 5, 2009. On November 10, 2009, MJN borrowed $200.0 million under its revolving credit agreement and used such proceeds, together with cash on hand, to repay all but $50 million of the remaining balance of the Intercompany Debt. The Intercompany Debt that remains outstanding is a portion of the floating rate note due 2014.
Under their terms, the 2014 Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.50% per year, the 2019 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.90% per year and the 2039 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.90% per year. MJN will pay interest on the Notes semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning May 1, 2010. The 2014 Notes will mature on November 1, 2014, the 2019 Notes will mature on November 1, 2019 and the 2039 Notes will mature on November 1, 2039. The Notes are unsecured and rank equally with all of MJN's existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness and are guaranteed by MJC. The Notes contain certain customary events of default and covenants, including limitations on consolidation, mergers, and sales of assets, limitations on the incurrence of certain liens, and limitations on certain sale and leaseback transactions.
At MJN's option, it may redeem some or all of the Notes, at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of the redemption and (ii) the sum of the net present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed discounted to the date of redemption at a specified rate, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to be redeemed to the date of the redemption. Additionally, if a change of control triggering event occurs, each holder of the Notes will have the right to require MJN to purchase all or a portion of such holder's Notes, at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest.
In connection with the issuance of the Notes, on November 5, 2009, MJN and MJC entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, MJN agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to cause to become effective a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange the Notes for freely tradable notes issued by MJN that are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and that have terms substantially identical in all material respects to the Notes. If MJN is unable to effect the exchange offer, MJN will use its reasonable best efforts to file and cause to become effective a shelf registration statement relating to resales of the Notes. MJN will be obligated to pay additional interest on the Notes if it does not complete the exchange offer (or, if required, the shelf registration is not declared effective) within 270 days after the issue date of the Notes.
The above description of the Base Indenture, Supplemental Indenture (including the Notes) and Registration Rights Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of those agreements, forms of which are attached as Exhibits 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.

WHEREAS, the Company has duly authorized the execution and delivery of this Indenture to provide for the issuance from time to time of its unsecured debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness, unlimited as to principal amount, to bear such rates of interest, to mature at such time or times, to be issued in one or more series and to have such other provisions as shall be fixed as hereinafter provided; and
WHEREAS, the Company has duly authorized the execution and delivery of this Indenture and all things necessary to make this Indenture a valid and legally binding agreement of the Company, in accordance with its terms, have been done.
NOW, THEREFORE, THIS INDENTURE WITNESSETH: For and in consideration of the premises and the purchase of the Securities by the Holders thereof, it is mutually covenanted and agreed, for the equal and proportionate benefit of all Holders of the Securities or of series thereof, as follows:
Section 1.1 .
Definitions
For all purposes of this Indenture, except as otherwise expressly provided or unless the context otherwise requires:
(a) the terms defined in this Article have the meanings assigned to them in this Article, and include the plural as well as the singular;

Additional Amounts
"" of any specified Person means any other Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with such specified Person. For the purposes of this definition, "control" when used with respect to any specified Person means the power to direct the management and policies of such Person, directly or indirectly, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; and the terms "controlling" and "controlled" have the meanings correlative to the foregoing.

The total net obligations of the lessee for rental payments under any such lease for any such periods shall be the aggregate amount of the rent payable by the lessee with respect to such period after excluding amounts required to be paid on account of maintenance and repairs, services, insurance, taxes, assessments, water rates and similar charges and contingent rents (such as those based on sales or monetary inflation). If any lease is terminable by the lessee upon the payment of a penalty and under the terms of the lease the termination right is not exercisable until after the determination date and the amount of such penalty discounted to the determination date as provided above is less than the net amount of rentals payable after the time as of which such termination could occur (the "termination time") discounted to the determination date as provided above, then such discounted penalty amount shall be used instead of such discounted amount of net rentals payable after the termination time in calculating the Attributable Debt for such lease. If any lease is terminable by the lessee upon the payment of a penalty and such termination right is exercisable on the determination date and the amount of the net rentals payable under such lease after the determination date discounted to the determination date as provided above is greater than the amount of such penalty, the "Attributable Debt" for such lease as of such determination date shall be equal to the amount of such penalty. If as of the determination date any Original Issue Discount Securities are Outstanding, then, for purposes of calculating Attributable Debt, the interest rate of the Original Issue Discount Securities shall be a rate equal to the yield to maturity on such Securities, calculated at the time of the issuance of such Securities, and the principal amount of such Original Issue Discount Securities shall be equal to the aggregate amount that would then be payable upon the acceleration of the maturity of such Securities pursuant to Section 5.2 hereof.

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in the form of Securities of any particular series pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture, where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of Securities of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given to Holders of Securities if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of a Security affected by such event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice.
In any case where notice to Holders of Securities is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder of a Security shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders of Securities. In the case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.
Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders of Securities shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.

The seal of the Company may be in the form of a facsimile thereof and may be impressed, affixed, imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Securities.

(a) that the form and terms of such Securities have been established in conformity with the provision of this Indenture;

provided
however
The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner that is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee or if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not lawfully be taken.
If the Company shall establish pursuant to Section 3.1 that Securities of a series may be issued in whole or in part in global form, then the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with this Section and the Company Order with respect to such series, authenticate and deliver one or more Securities in global form that (i) shall represent and shall be denominated in an authorized aggregate amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series and tenor to be represented by one or more Securities in global form, (ii) shall be registered, in the name of the Depositary for such Security or Securities in global form or the nominee of such Depositary, (iii) shall be delivered to such Depositary or pursuant to such Depositary's instruction and (iv) shall bear a legend substantially to the following effect: "Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Notes in certificated form, this Note may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the
 
Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary. Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company (55 Water Street, New York, New York) to the issuer or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any certificate issued is registered in the name of CEDE & CO. or such other name as requested by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company and any payment is made to CEDE & CO., any transfer, pledge or other use hereof for value or otherwise by or to any person is wrongful since the registered owner hereof, CEDE & CO., has an interest herein." Each Depositary designated pursuant to Section 3.1 for a Security in global form must, at the time of its designation and at all times while it serves as Depositary, be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and any other applicable statute or regulation.
Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose, unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for in Section 2.2 or 6.14 executed by or on behalf of the Trustee by the manual signature of one of its authorized signatories, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.
Section 3.4 .
Temporary Securities
Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute and deliver to the Trustee, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the manner provided in Section 3.3, temporary Securities of such series that are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued, in registered form without coupons and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers of the Company executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities. In the case of Securities of any series, such temporary Securities may be in global form, representing all of the Outstanding Securities of such series and tenor.
Except in the case of temporary Securities in global form, which shall be exchanged in accordance with the provisions thereof, if temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable upon request for definitive Securities of such series containing identical terms and provisions upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at an office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose pursuant to Section 10.2, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Securities of authorized denominations of the same series containing identical terms and provisions. Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 with respect to a temporary Security in global form, until so exchanged the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series.
 
Section 3.5 .
Registration, Transfer and Exchange
With respect to the Securities of each series, if any, the Company shall cause to be kept, at an office or agency of the Company maintained pursuant to Section 10.2, a register (herein sometimes referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of the Securities of each series and of transfers of the Securities of each series. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers and exchanges of Securities as herein provided; , that the Company may, from time to time, designate (or change any designation of) any other Person or Persons to act as Security Registrar or co-Security Registrars with respect to the Securities of one or more series, with notice to the Trustee and as provided in Section 1.6 to the Holders. At all reasonable times the Security Register shall be open for inspection by the Company. In the event that the Trustee shall not be the Security Registrar, it shall have the right to examine the Security Register at all reasonable times.
provided
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of any series at any office or agency of the Company maintained for that series pursuant to Section 10.2, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee, at the direction of the Company, shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series of an authorized denomination, of a like aggregate principal amount bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding and containing identical terms and provisions.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for the individual Securities represented thereby, in definitive form, a Security in global form representing all or a portion of the Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such series to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series containing identical terms and provisions, in any authorized denominations, and of a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at any such office or agency of the Company maintained for that series pursuant to Section 10.2. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee, at the direction of the Company, shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities that the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
If at any time the Depositary for the Securities of a series notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the Securities of such series or if at any time the Depositary for the Securities of such series shall no longer be eligible under Section 3.3, the Company, by Company Order, shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to the Securities of such series. If a successor Depositary for the Securities of such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Company's election pursuant to Section 3.1(c) shall no longer be
 
effective with respect to the Securities of such series and the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount and of like terms and tenor equal to the principal amount of the Security or Securities in global form representing such series in exchange for such Security or Securities in global form.
The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that individual Securities of any series issued in global form shall no longer be represented by such Security or Securities in global form. In such event the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of individual definitive Securities of such series and of the same terms and tenor, will authenticate and deliver individual Securities of such series in definitive form in authorized denominations and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Security or Securities in global form representing such series in exchange for such Security or Securities in global form.
If specified by the Company pursuant to Section 3.1 with respect to a series of Securities, the Depositary for such series of Securities may surrender a Security in global form for such series of Securities in exchange in whole or in part for individual Securities of such series in definitive form and of like terms and tenor on such terms as are acceptable to the Company, the Trustee and such Depositary. Thereupon, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of individual definitive Securities of such series, shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge:
(a) to the Depositary or to each Person specified by such Depositary a new individual Security or Securities of the same series and of the same tenor, of authorized denominations, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Security in global form; and
(b) to such Depositary a new Security in global form in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Security in global form and the aggregate principal amount of the individual Securities delivered to Holders thereof.
In any exchange provided for in any of the preceding three paragraphs, the Company will execute and the Trustee pursuant to a Company Order will authenticate and deliver individual Securities in definitive registered form in authorized denominations.
Upon the exchange of a Security in global form for Securities in definitive form, at the direction of the Company, such Security in global form shall be cancelled by the Trustee. Securities issued in exchange for a Security in global form pursuant to this Section shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Security in global form, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee in writing. The Trustee shall deliver such Securities to the persons in whose names such Securities are so registered or to the Depositary.
 
Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee, at the direction of the Company, shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities that the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange or redemption shall (if so required by the Company or the Security Registrar for such series of Security presented) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and such Security Registrar duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 3.4, 9.6 or 11.7 not involving any transfer.
The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Securities of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the selection for redemption of Securities of that series under Section 11.3 and ending at the close of business on the day of such selection, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except in the case of any Security to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not to be redeemed.
Section 3.6 .
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee, at the direction of the Company, shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series containing identical terms and of like principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
If there be delivered to the Company and to the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security, and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series containing identical terms and of like principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
 
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
Section 3.7 .
Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved
Interest on any Security that is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall, if so provided in such Security, be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered as of the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
Any interest on any Security of any series that is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date for such Security (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder; and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (a) or (b) below:
(a) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities affected (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each such Security and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each Holder of such Securities at his address as it appears in the Security Register not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. The Trustee may, in its discretion, in the name and at the expense of the Company, cause a similar notice to be published at least once in a newspaper, customarily published in the English
 
language on each Business Day and of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, but such publication shall not be a condition precedent to the establishment of such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names such Securities (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (b).
(b) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
Interest on Securities of any series that bear interest may be paid by mailing a check to the address of the person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register or by wire transfer or other electronic means.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and Section 3.5, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.

The Company will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers.

Upon the direction of the Company by a Company Order, this Indenture shall cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities herein expressly provided for, rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee set forth in the last paragraph of this Section and any right to receive Additional Amounts, as provided in Section 10.4), and the Trustee, pursuant to a Company Order and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instructions acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when:

(ii) all such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation:
(1) have become due and payable, or
 
(2) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year, or
(3) if redeemable at the option of the Company, are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company,
and the Company, in the case of (1), (2) or (3) above, has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose an amount sufficient to pay and discharge, or U.S. Government Obligations, maturing as to principal and paying interest in such amounts and at such times as will insure the availability of cash sufficient to pay and discharge, the entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, and any Additional Amounts with respect thereto, to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities that have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be;

Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment
If an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(d) or (e)) occurs and is continuing, then, and in each and every case, unless the principal of all of the Securities of such series shall have already become due and payable, either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by such Holders), may declare the entire principal of all Securities of such series, or such lesser amount as may be provided for in the Securities of such series, and the interest accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall become due and payable immediately.
If an Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(d) or (e) occurs and is continuing, then, and in each and every such case, unless the principal of all the Securities shall have already become due and payable, the entire principal of all the Outstanding Securities, or such lesser amount as may be provided for in the Securities of any series, and interest accrued thereon shall automatically become due and payable immediately without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.
At any time after a declaration of acceleration (other than resulting from an Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(d) or (e)) with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may waive all defaults with respect to such series and rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
(a) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay:
(i) all overdue installments of interest on and any Additional Amounts payable in respect of all Securities of that series,
(ii) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities of that series that have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate or rates borne by or provided for in such Securities,
(iii) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue installments of interest and Additional Amounts at the rate or rates borne by or provided for in such Securities, and
 
(iv) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; and
(b) all Events of Default with respect to the Securities of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal of the Securities of that series that has become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.13.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 5.3 .
Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee
The Company covenants that if:
(a) default is made in the payment of any installment of interest on or any Additional Amounts payable in respect of any Security when such interest or Additional Amounts shall have become due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or
(b) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security at its Maturity,
the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal (and premium, if any) and interest and Additional Amounts, if any, with interest upon the overdue principal (and premium, if any) and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, upon overdue installments of interest or any Additional Amounts, at the rate or rates borne by or provided for in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities, wherever situated.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem necessary to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

Trustee May File Proofs of Claim
In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,
(a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount, or such lesser amount as may be provided for in the Securities of that series, of principal (and premium, if any) and interest and any Additional Amounts owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents or counsel) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
(b) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
and any receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator (or other similar official) in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder of Securities to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders of Securities, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.7.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of a Security any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder of a Security in any such proceeding.

Third: The balance, if any, to the Company or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.

it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other such Holders or Holders of any other series, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all such Holders.
 
Section 5.8 .
Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and Interest
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Sections 3.5 and 3.7) interest on and any Additional Amounts in respect of such Security on the respective Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such right shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.

(i) If any Global Security is to be exchanged for Certificated Securities or canceled in whole, it shall be surrendered by or on behalf of the Depositary or its nominee to the Trustee, as Security Registrar, for exchange or cancellation as provided in this Section 2.4 or Article 3 of the Base Indenture. If any Global Security is to be exchanged for Certificated Securities or canceled in part, or if a Certificated Security is to be exchanged in whole or in part for a beneficial interest in any Global Security, then either (i) such Global Security shall be so surrendered for exchange or cancellation as provided in this Section 2.4 or Article 3 of the Base Indenture or (ii) the principal amount thereof shall be reduced or increased by an amount equal to the portion thereof to be so exchanged or

Section 2.5 .
Change of Control
(a) If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs with respect to the Notes of any series, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem the Notes of such series (as described in Section 2.3(e)), the Company shall be required to make an offer (the "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder of the Notes of such series to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Notes on the terms set forth below. In the Change of Control Offer, the Company shall be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of repurchase (the "Change of Control Payment"). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the option of the Company, prior to any Change of Control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice to Holders of the Notes describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date"). The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
(b) On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful:

(d) The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this Section 2.5, the Company shall comply with those securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Section 2.5 by virtue of any such conflict.
 
(e) In addition to the Events of Default specified in Section 5.1 of the Base Indenture, the following shall constitute an "Event of Default" with respect to each series of the Notes: any default in the payment of any Change of Control Payment in respect of the Notes of such series as when the same becomes due and payable in accordance with Section 2.5 hereof. Such additional Event of Default is expressly included in this Supplemental Indenture for the benefit of, and shall be solely applicable to, the three series of Securities established by this Supplemental Indenture.
Section 2.6 . So long as any of the Notes are "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act, the Company will, during any period in which it is not subject to and in compliance with Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, provide to each holder of such restricted securities and to each prospective purchaser (as designated by such holder) of such restricted securities, upon the request of such holder or prospective purchaser, any information required to be provided by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.
Rule 144A Information
Section 3.1 . Subject to the provisions of this Article 3, the Guarantor hereby fully and unconditionally guarantees (the "Guarantee"), to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity or enforceability of the Indenture, the Notes or the obligations of the Company under the Indenture or the Notes, that: (i) the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, upon redemption, upon repurchase pursuant to Section 2.5 hereof or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal and premium, if any, and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, overdue installments of, interest on the Notes will be promptly paid in full; (ii) all other payment obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee under the Indenture or the Notes will be promptly paid in full, all in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Notes; and (iii) in case of any extension of time in payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other obligations, they will be paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed, for whatever reason, the Guarantor will be obligated to pay, the same on demand. The Guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment not a guarantee of collection.
Terms of the Guarantee
The Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations with regard to this Guarantee shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or the obligations of the Company under the Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, the recovery of any judgment against the Company or any other obligor with respect to the Indenture, the Notes or the obligations of the Company under the Indenture or the Notes, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstances (other than complete performance) which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor. The Guarantor further, to the extent permitted by law, hereby waives (a) demand, protest and notice of any kind, (b) any defense that may arise by reason of the incapacity, lack of authority, death or disability of any other person or the failure of the Trustee, the Holders or the
 
Company (each a "") to file or enforce a claim against the estate (in administration, bankruptcy or any other proceeding) of any other person, (c) notice of the existence, creation or incurring of any new or additional indebtedness or obligation, (d) any right to require a proceeding first against the Company or right to require the prior disposition of the assets of the Company to meet its obligations, (e) any defense based upon an election of remedies by a Benefitted Party, including but not limited to an election at law which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal, (f) any defense arising because of a Benefitted Party's election, in any proceeding instituted under bankruptcy law, of the application of 11 U.S.C. Section 1111(b)(2) or (g) any defense based on any borrowing or grant of a security interest under 11 U.S.C. Section 364. The Guarantor hereby covenants that, except as provided in Section 3.3 hereof, the Guarantee will not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes, the Guarantee and the Indenture.
Benefitted Party
Section 3.2 . The Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by the Indenture, including, without limitation, the net proceeds of the sale of the Notes. The Guarantor and, by the acceptance of any Note issued hereunder, each beneficiary hereof confirms that it is its intention that the Guarantee not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of the Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal, state or foreign law to the extent applicable to the Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, each such person hereby irrevocably agrees that the obligation of the Guarantor under the Guarantee under this Article 3 shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other (contingent or otherwise) liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, result in the obligations of the Guarantor in respect of such maximum amount not constituting a fraudulent conveyance.
Limitation of the Guarantor's Liability
Section 3.3 . The Guarantor's obligations with regard to its Guarantee under this Article 3 shall terminate and be automatically released, without further action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder of the Notes, at such time as the Guarantor is no longer an obligor (either as a primary obligor or guarantor) under the MJN Credit Facility. Once released in accordance with this Section 3.3, the Guarantee under this Article 3 shall not be reinstated. The Company shall provide the Trustee with notice of such termination and release, but the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such termination and release.
Release of the Guarantor's Liability
Section 3.4 . Subject to Section 3.3, the Guarantor's obligations under this Article 3 will remain in full force and effect until the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and all other amounts payable by the Company under the Indenture have been paid in full. Subject to Section 3.3, if at any time any payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Note or any other amount payable by the Company under the Indenture is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise, the Guarantor's obligations under this Article 3 with respect to such payment will be reinstated as though such payment had been due but not made at such time.
Discharge; Reinstatement
 
Section 3.5 . If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by the Company under the Indenture or the Notes is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Indenture shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantor under this Article 3 forthwith on demand by the Trustee.
Stay of Acceleration
Section 3.6 . The execution by the Guarantor of the Indenture (or a supplemental indenture) evidences the Guarantee of the Guarantor, whether or not the person signing as an officer of the Guarantor still holds that office at the time of authentication of any Note. The delivery of any Note by the Trustee after authentication constitutes due delivery of the Guarantee set forth in the Indenture on behalf of the Guarantor.
Execution and Delivery of Guarantee
Section 4.1 . The Base Indenture, as supplemented by this Supplemental Indenture, is in all respects hereby adopted, ratified and confirmed.
Ratification
Section 4.2 . Without the consent of any Holders of the Notes, the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the Trustee, at any time and from time to time, may amend or modify the Indenture to provide for the issuance of the Exchange Notes.
Exchange Notes
Section 4.3 . This Supplemental Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original, and all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
Section 4.4 . THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE AND THE NOTES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CHOICE OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF.

In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Company and the Guarantor may require, as a condition to including such Holder's Registrable Securities in such Shelf Registration Statement, each Holder of Registrable Securities to furnish, within 20 Business Days after receipt of request thereof, to the Company and the Guarantor such information regarding the Holder and the proposed distribution by such Holder of such Registrable Securities as the Company and the Guarantor may from time to time reasonably request in writing.
Each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company or the Guarantor of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(e)(v) hereof, such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 3(i) hereof, and, if so directed by the Company or the Guarantor, such Holder will deliver to the Company or the Guarantor (at the Company's and the Guarantor's expense) all copies in its possession, other than permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice. It is agreed that the Company's and the Guarantor's option to suspend the use of a Registration Statement pursuant to this paragraph shall constitute a "Permitted Suspension Event" as defined below.
In addition, the Company may suspend the offering and sales under the Shelf Registration Statement during the period that the Shelf Registration Statement is required to be effective and usable hereunder:
if (1) either:
(A) the Company shall be engaged in a material acquisition or disposition and (i) such acquisition or disposition is required to be disclosed in the Shelf Registration Statement, the related Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or the failure by the Company to disclose such transaction in the Shelf Registration Statement or related Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, as then amended or supplemented, would cause such Shelf Registration Statement, or amendment thereto, to contain an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement therein not misleading, or would cause such Prospectus, or supplement thereto, to contain an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement therein not misleading, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, (ii) information regarding the existence of such acquisition or disposition has not then been publicly disclosed by or on behalf of the Company and (iii) a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company determines in the exercise of its good faith judgment that disclosure of such acquisition or disposition would not be in the best interest of the Company or would have a material adverse effect on the consummation of such acquisition or disposition; or
(B) a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company determines in the exercise of its good faith judgment that compliance with the disclosure obligations set forth in Section 3(i) would otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (the matters described in clauses (A) and (B) are each referred to herein as a "");
Permitted Suspension Event
and (2) the Company notifies the Holders within two Business Days after such Board of Directors makes the relevant determination set forth in clause (1).
If the Company or the Guarantor shall give any such notice to suspend the disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement, the Company and the Guarantor shall extend the period during which the Registration Statement shall be maintained effective pursuant to this Agreement by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when the Holders shall have received notice that the suspension of the disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement has ended and received copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus necessary to resume such dispositions. The Company and the Guarantor may invoke a Permitted Suspension Event only twice during any 365 day period and any such suspensions may not exceed 60 days in the aggregate.
The Holders of Registrable Securities covered by a Shelf Registration Statement who desire to do so may sell such Registrable Securities in an Underwritten Offering. In any such Underwritten Offering, the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers (the "") that will administer the offering will be selected by the Majority Holders of the Registrable Securities included in such offering.

Participation of Broker-Dealers in Exchange Offer.
(a) The Staff has taken the position that any broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account in the Exchange Offer in exchange for Registrable Securities that were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making or other trading activities (a ""), may be deemed to be an "" within the meaning of the 1933 Act and must deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the 1933 Act in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.
Participating Broker-Dealer
underwriter
Each of the Company and the Guarantor understands that it is the Staff's position that if the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement includes a plan of distribution containing a statement to the above effect and the means by which Participating Broker-Dealers may resell the Exchange Securities, without naming the Participating Broker-Dealers or
specifying the amount of Exchange Securities owned by them, such Prospectus may be delivered by Participating Broker-Dealers to satisfy their prospectus delivery obligation under the 1933 Act in connection with resales of Exchange Securities for their own accounts, so long as the Prospectus otherwise meets the requirements of the 1933 Act.
(b) The Company shall indicate in a "Plan of Distribution" section contained in the Prospectus forming a part of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement that any Participating Broker-Dealer who holds Registrable Securities that were acquired for its own account as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities (other than Registrable Securities acquired directly from the Company), may exchange such Registrable Securities pursuant to the Exchange Offer; however, such Participating Broker-Dealer may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the 1933 Act and must, therefore, deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the 1933 Act in connection with any resales of the Exchange Securities received by such Participating Broker-Dealer in the Exchange Offer, which prospectus delivery requirement may be satisfied by the delivery by such Participating Broker-Dealer of the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement. Such "Plan of Distribution" section shall also contain all other information with respect to such resales by any Participating Broker-Dealers that the SEC may require in order to permit such resales pursuant thereto, but such "Plan of Distribution" shall not name any such Participating Broker-Dealer or disclose the amount of Registrable Securities held by any such Participating Broker-Dealer except to the extent required by the SEC as a result of a change in policy after the date of this Agreement.
(c) In the event the Company receives notice from one or more Participating Broker-Dealers in connection with the Exchange Offer or within 20 days after the consummation of the Exchange Offer that such Participating Broker-Dealer is exchanging or has exchanged Registrable Securities acquired for the account of such Participating Broker-Dealer as a result of market making or other trading activities, then each of the Company and the Guarantor shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement continuously effective, supplemented and amended to the extent necessary to ensure that it is available for resales of Exchange Securities acquired by any Participating Broker-Dealers upon exchange of Registrable Securities acquired by such Participating Broker-Dealers for their own accounts as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities, and to ensure that it conforms with the requirements of this Agreement, the 1933 Act and the policies, rules and regulations of the SEC as announced from time to time, for a period ending on the earlier of (i) 180 days after the last Exchange Date and (ii) the date on which a Participating Broker-Dealer is no longer required to deliver a prospectus in connection with market-making or other trading activities.
(d) Each of the Company and the Guarantors hereby consents to the use of the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto by each of the Participating Broker-Dealers in connection with this Section 4; provided that, for resales of Exchange Securities by the Participating Broker-Dealer more than 20 days after the consummation of the Exchange Offer, the Participating Broker-Dealer has given notice to the Company as contemplated by Section 4(c) above. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5 hereof, the Company and the Guarantors will not be required to indemnify any Participating Broker-Dealer for any losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by the use of the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto by such Participating Broker-Dealer in connection with resales of Exchange Securities by such Participating Broker-Dealer more than 20 days after the consummation of the Exchange Offer if such Participating Broker-Dealer has not given notice to the Company as contemplated by Section 4(c) above.
(e) The Initial Purchasers shall have no liability to the Company, the Guarantor or any Holder with respect to any request that may be made pursuant to Section 4(c) above.
5.
Indemnification and Contribution.
(a) The Company and the Guarantor, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers, each Holder and each Person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser or any Holder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, or is under common control with, or is controlled by, any Initial Purchaser or any Holder, from and against all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Initial Purchasers, any Holder or any such controlling or affiliated Person in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) to which any such person may be subject under the 1933 Act, 1934 Act or any other federal or state statute or regulation, or at common law, or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage or liability is caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) pursuant to which Exchange Securities or Registrable Securities were registered under the 1933 Act, including all documents incorporated therein by reference, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company and the Guarantor shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to the Initial Purchasers or any Holder furnished to the Company and the Guarantor in writing by Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated or any selling Holder expressly for use therein. In connection with any Underwritten Offering permitted by Section 3, the Company and the Guarantor will also indemnify the Underwriters, if any, their officers and directors and each Person who controls such Persons (within the meaning of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Holders, if requested in connection with any Registration Statement.
(b) Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantor, the Initial Purchasers and the other selling Holders, and each of their respective directors, officers who sign the Registration Statement and each Person, if any, who controls the Company, any Initial Purchaser and any other selling Holder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Guarantor to the Initial Purchasers and the Holders, but only with reference to information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company and the Guarantor in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any Person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) above, such Person (the "") shall promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have
indemnified party
indemnifying party
the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for (A) the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Initial Purchasers and all Persons, if any, who control any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of either Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, (B) the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Company and the Guarantor, their respective directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each Person, if any, who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of either such Section and (C) the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Holders and all Persons, if any, who control any Holders within the meaning of either such Section, and that all such reasonable fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In such case involving the Initial Purchasers and Persons who control the Initial Purchasers, such firm shall be designated in writing by Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated. In such case involving the Holders and such Persons who control Holders, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Majority Holders. In all other cases, such firm shall be designated jointly by the Company and the Guarantor. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but, if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for reasonable fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party for such fees and expenses of counsel in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which such
indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of this Section 5 is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and of the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Guarantor, on the one hand, or by the Holders, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Holders' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 5(d) are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Registrable Securities of such Holder that were registered pursuant to a Registration Statement.
(e) The Company, the Guarantor and each Holder agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, no Holder shall be required to indemnify or contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which Registrable Securities were sold by such Holder exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 5 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 5 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers, any Holder or any Person controlling any Initial Purchaser or any Holder, or by or on behalf of the Company or the Guarantor, their respective officers or directors or any Person controlling the Company, (iii) acceptance of any of the Exchange Securities and (iv) any sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement.
