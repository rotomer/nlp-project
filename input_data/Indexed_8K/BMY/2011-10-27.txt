This line-item guidance assumes current foreign exchange rate.
The financial guidance for 2011 excludes the impact of any potential strategic acquisitions and divestitures, and any specified items that have not yet been identified and quantified. The non-GAAP 2011 guidance also exclude other specified items as discussed under "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information."

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

Among the items in GAAP measures but excluded for purposes of determining adjusted earnings and other adjusted measures are: restructuring and other exit costs; accelerated depreciation charges; IPRD and asset impairments; charges and recoveries relating to significant legal proceedings; upfront, milestone and other licensing payments for in-licensing of products that have not achieved regulatory approval which are immediately expensed; and significant tax events.

For example, non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share information is an indication of the company's baseline performance before items that are considered by the company not to be reflective of the company's ongoing results. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators the company uses as a basis for evaluating company performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting of future periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted earnings per share prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The annual EPS impact of U.S. healthcare reform is expected to increase from $0.10 in 2010 to approximately $0.23 in 2011. In 2011, we expect a reduction of net sales of approximately $270 million resulting from new discounts associated with the Medicare Part D coverage gap and an increase in marketing, sales and administrative expenses of approximately $220 million due to the new annual non-tax-deductible pharmaceutical company fee. The non-tax deductibility on our share of the net pharmaceutical company fee is expected to increase our effective tax rate by approximately 1% in 2011 which is considered in our effective tax rate guidance above.
