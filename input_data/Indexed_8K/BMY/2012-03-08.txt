Item 8.01. Other Events.
On March 6, 2012, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (the "Company") announced that the Board of Directors had declared a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share on the Company's $0.10 par value Common Stock. The press release incorrectly identified the record date. The quarterly dividend is payable on May 1, 2012 to stockholders of record on April 5, 2012 (not April 6, 2012, a stock exchange holiday, as stated in the press release).
The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share on the Company's $2.00 Convertible Preferred Stock, payable June 1, 2012, to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 4, 2012, which remains unchanged.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
